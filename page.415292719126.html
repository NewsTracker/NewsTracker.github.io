<h3>Boko Haram is said to have pledged allegiance to Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>New York: One of the deadliest terrorist organisations in Africa has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, according to a message posted online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>If confirmed, the pledge would make the group, Boko Haram, which is believed to have as many as 6,000 fighters, the largest extremist group to date to agree to fight under the Islamic State banner, analysts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In the message published on his Twitter account on Saturday, Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram's leader, announced that he had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Terrorism experts say that the pledge, or "bayat", is a spiritually binding oath, and it indicates that Boko Haram's leader agrees to be under the authority of the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But as with such pledges from other groups elsewhere in the world, including in Libya, it remains unclear how much direct control the Islamic State leaders have over their distant proxies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A cache of weapons that Nigeria's military recovered from Boko Haram terrorists in northeastern Nigeria earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>If confirmed, the agreement with Boko Haram would mirror the steps taken by Islamic State affiliates in Libya, Algeria, Egypt, Afghanistan and beyond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In each case, a group's leaders swore allegiance in a public message posted online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Weeks later, the oath was formally accepted by the Islamic State in a statement issued by the group's official spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If the Islamic State does embrace Boko Haram, it is uncertain what level of coordination there will be between the terrorist outfits thousands of miles apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's quite clear that since at least mid-January, the Islamic State has had some level of connection with Boko Haram," said Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Institute who tracks propaganda by Islamic extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The key question is whether the Islamic State dispatched individuals from Syria or Iraq or else from Libya, down to northern Nigeria to help out with operations on the ground, or else with methodology, or in terms of governance activities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With an estimated 6,000 fighters and with at least some level of control over approximately 20,000 square kilometres of northeastern Nigeria, Boko Haram is believed to be the largest jihadi group to pledge fidelity to the Islamic State, according to Ryan Cummings, chief Africa analyst for red24, a crisis management group based in Britain, who has been following the Nigerian terrorist organisation since 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But Mr Cummings raised questions about what kind of command-and-control structure could exist between the two entities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It seems at the moment that this is a statement that is akin to saying, 'We are on the same page,'" he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"But the biggest issue with Boko Haram is that it's not a homogeneous group and it behaves as different factions. So it's too early to tell for sure if Boko Haram will fall directly under ISIS command, and to what extent they will act as an ISIS proxy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>For roughly 18 months, there have been growing signs of a link between the organizations, as well as suggestions that the Islamic State has been grooming Boko Haram for entry into its network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Last year, the Nigerian group's leader declared his support for the group's commander and began using the Islamic State battle hymn as the soundtrack for videos documenting his atrocities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Retreating Boko Haram leaves mass of throat-slit...</td></tr>

<h3>Saint hits the big shot</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>With a defender in his face, Tombe turned on the wing and hit nothing but the bottom of the net with a 29-footer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was fouled on the play and made the free throw with 20 seconds left to play, propelling the Saints to a 46-42 win over Torrey Pines to claim the San Diego Section Open Division title Saturday at Jenny Craig Pavilion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>For good measure, Tombe grabbed a defensive rebound on the other end of the floor after a Torrey Pines miss and sank both free throws with 4 seconds remaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I think all my shots are going in," said Tombe, who finished with a game-high 19 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I didn't see that one go in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I just saw everyone jumping around. To be honest, the free throws at the end were tougher because it closed the game out."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Neither team led by more than five points in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the fourth quarter, the game was tied or the lead changed hands 12 times - on all but two scores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"That was like a college game," said St. Augustine coach Mike Haupt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It was a grind all night. I figured it would come down to the last score, and it did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Tombe has been locked in for a while now. He has the green light to take a shot like he hit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sixth-seeded St. Augustine (25-6), a Division IV team in the state, stretched its winning streak to seven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>St. Augustine will most likely represent San Diego in the Open Division of the SoCal Regionals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Top-seeded Torrey Pines (29-3), ranked No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>20 in the state, saw its 19-game winning streak snapped.</td></tr>
