<h3>German factory orders down more than expected in January</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN (AP) - German factory orders, a key indicator for Europe's biggest economy, dropped much further than expected in January, led by a big drop in demand from other eurozone countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Orders were down 3.9 percent compared with the previous month, the Federal Statistical Office said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Economists had forecast a 1 percent decline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The fall was led by a 9 percent drop in orders from elsewhere in the 19-nation eurozone, while domestic orders fell 2.5 percent and demand from other nations slipped 2.2 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Germany's factory orders data can be volatile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The fall in January followed a 4.4 percent gain in December, revised upward Thursday from an initial reading of 4.2 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The economy is in generally robust shape, with domestic demand strong thanks in part to low oil prices and a weaker euro set to help exports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Economist Andreas Rees at UniCredit said that, despite January's orders setback, "there is no reason to worry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The latest decrease does not have anything to do with a sudden deterioration in fundamentals at the start of the new year," Rees said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Instead, it is some kind of a technical breather after unusually strong rises in the previous few months."</td></tr>
