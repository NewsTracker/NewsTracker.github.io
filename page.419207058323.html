<h3>Donald Trump and Roger Ailes Make Up â€” For Now</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A truce to prevent Trump from potentially damaging the Fox News brand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Until Thursday's GOP debate, Fox News chairman Roger Ailes and Donald Trump had been executing one of the most successful examples of media synergy in recent memory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the Trump-Ailes alliance - which helped generate a record debate audience of 24 million - has been in tatters ever since Fox's debate moderators peppered Trump with critical questions onstage in Cleveland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>From the moment Trump faced reporters in the post-debate "Spin Room," he's been attacking the network's treatment of him, with special venom reserved for Megyn Kelly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Now, it appears both sides want peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This morning, Trump tweeted that Ailes called to assure him that Fox will cover him "fairly" going forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>According to two high-level Fox sources, Ailes's diplomacy was the result of increasing concern inside Fox News that Trump could damage the network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Immediately following Thursday's debate, Fox was deluged with pro-Trump emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The chatter on Twitter was equally in Trump's favor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"In the beginning, virtually 100 percent of the emails were against Megyn Kelly," one Fox source, who was briefed on the situation told me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Roger was not happy. Most of the Fox viewers were taking Trump's side."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Things got worse for Ailes over the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In a phone conversation, Trump told Sean Hannity that "he was never doing Fox again," according to one person with knowledge of the call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The anti-Kelly emails, and threat of a boycott by Trump, seem to have pushed Ailes to diffuse the war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>One Fox personality told me that Fox producers gave instructions to tell in-house talent not to bring up Trump's controversial comments that Kelly had "blood coming out of her wherever" during the debate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>According to one count, Fox only aired Trump's comment once since Friday, while CNN mentioned it at least 50 times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In recent days, Ailes got a glimpse of what a Trump-less Fox News would look like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Sunday, Trump called in to the four other public-affairs shows; this morning he gave interviews to Today and Morning Joe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Inside Fox, this was alarming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"This thing with Megyn got way ahead of Roger and bigger than he must have thought," one Fox personality said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Roger wants this to blow over," another source added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"He's upset that conservatives are mad at Fox."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Online, Ailes also took flak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Both the Drudge Report and Breitbart News carried pro-Trump headlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Whatever Ailes said to Trump in their phone call earlier, it seems to have worked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Trump has agreed to interviews on Fox & Friends and Hannity tomorrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Irena Briganti, a Fox spokesperson, did not return a call for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Trump campaign declined to comment.</td></tr>
