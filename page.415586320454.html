<h3>Joseph Gordon-Levitt to make 'Fraggle Rock' movie</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Gordon-Levitt's been acting since he was about six, but it wasn't until his mid-20s that his incredible work ethic grew into bona fide "star" status.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The heartthrob made his directorial debut with "Don Jon" and is planning to reboot the TV favorite "Fraggle Rock" for the big screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some actors crash and tumble into adult celebrity, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt took the quiet route.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Let's retrace the steps Gordon-Levitt took to arrive here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He was only on the series for two episodes, but clearly the kid was going places.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Can you say "awwww"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At the tender age of 7, JGL picked up a role on the classic NBC sitcom, "Family Ties," as Dougie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In 1991, Gordon-Levitt moved over to NBC's reinvented "Dark Shadows," where he played both David and Daniel Collins during the short-lived series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gordon-Levitt made the leap to the big screen in 1992, when he had a bit part in "Beethoven" and a more substantial role in "A River Runs Through It."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Directed by Robert Redford, the actor played a younger version of Craig Sheffer's Norman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Even as a kid, Gordon-Levitt was industrious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While he was building his film career, Gordon-Levitt was also pulling in laughs as D.J.'s well-meaning but incredibly boring friend George on "Roseanne" from 1993 to 1995.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In 1994, Gordon-Levitt appeared in one of the most memorable roles of his young career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He starred with Danny Glover and Tony Danza in Disney's baseball movie, "Angels in the Outfield."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>James Gandolfini wasn't the only one building his film resume with 1996's "The Juror."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A then 15-year-old Gordon-Levitt also starred in the suspense drama as the son of Demi Moore's character, Annie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>If you know nothing else about him, you know that Gordon-Levitt once played alien Tommy Solomon on the long-running sitcom "3rd Rock from the Sun."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On the NBC comedy, a teenage Levitt played one of four extraterrestrial explorers masquerading as humans on Earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Although it's the role that helped establish him with TV audiences, Levitt opted to leave the show ahead of its final season in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In the 1999 teen romantic comedy classic "10 Things I Hate About You," Gordon-Levitt joined Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles in a WB-esque re-telling of "Taming of the Shrew."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He starred as the sweet, swooning new kid, Cameron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Gordon-Levitt was known mostly for his comedic roles, but 2001's "Manic" was a clear departure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>This bleak drama about troubled adolescents in a juvenile detention facility let the then 20-year-old display more of his range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>After taking time off from acting to pursue higher education at Columbia, Gordon-Levitt made a grand return to the craft in 2004 and 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He starred in two independent projects -- "Mysterious Skin" and "Brick" -- that caused critics to take note of how much he'd grown up from playing an alien in a teenager's body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>While "Mysterious Skin" saw Levitt playing a young hustler and prostitute with a devastating past, "Brick," placed him in the scene-stealing role of a high-schooler-turned-detective after his girlfriend goes missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Said Rolling Stone's movie critic Peter Travers, "'Sensational' is the word for Joseph Gordon-Levitt (equally striking in 'Mysterious Skin')" in "Brick."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>By the time Gordon-Levitt appeared in 2007's "The Lookout" as a disabled janitor, his transition from kid star to Hollywood heavy was virtually complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Critics were in love with the young star's performance, as The Wall Street Journal's Joe Morgenstern said in a review: "We saw what (he) could do in such diverse films as 'Mysterious Skin' and 'Brick,' and in the TV sitcom '3rd Rock From the Sun.' But this performance is something else. It's unforgettable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>After starring in a series of dramas, Gordon-Levitt turned to (comparatively) lighter fare with "(500) Days of Summer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Part comedy, part love story, part musical, part drama, the 2009 film was twee and at times over-the-top, but also irresistible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In the role of hopeless romantic Tom, Gordon-Levitt was, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The same year he wooed moviegoers with "(500) Days," Gordon-Levitt also starred in the action movie "G.I. Joe: Revenge of the Cobra."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>For an actor who had spent his post-collegiate career gravitating toward smaller productions and complex characters, the fact he could lighten up and have fun as the Cobra Commander helped prove his versatility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>As a prolific performer, Gordon-Levitt will often offer his fans a buffet of films to choose from, all within a single year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>That was the case in 2010, when those drawn to the darker side of Gordon-Levitt could watch him as the foul-mouthed, tattooed lead in "Hesher."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>For those who wanted more sci-fi action at the theater in 2010, Gordon-Levitt delivered with Christopher Nolan's "Inception."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>He fully impressed -- and opened himself up to an even wider audience -- with his gravity-defying stunts, standing out as one of the film's top draws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>In 2011, Gordon-Levitt tried to find a balance between his comedic roots and dramatic present with a poignant examination of cancer's impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The movie "50/50" was inspired by a true story, and with the popular Seth Rogen backing him up, Levitt again received raves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"Every performance in this film is flawless," proclaimed USA Today's Claudia Puig.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>fans hoped was a hint that Gordon-Levitt was actually the Robin to Bruce Wayne's Batman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Last year easily could have been re-named The Year of Joseph Gordon-Levitt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>It seemed barely a month would go by without one of the actor's projects playing in theaters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>There was his standout turn as John Blake in "The Dark Knight Rises," which many fans hoped was a hint that Gordon-Levitt was actually the Robin to Bruce Wayne's Batman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>There was also Gordon-Levitt's turn as a fast-pedaling bike messenger in "Premium Rush."</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The consensus was that it wasn't bad -- nothing more, nothing less -- but considering how busy JGL must have been during his production, we'll give him a pass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Gordon-Levitt also transformed into a Bruce Willis lookalike for his reunion with "Brick" director Rian Johnson and his futuristic thriller, "Looper."</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Critics salivated over its gripping plot, and while Gordon-Levitt had prosthetics to help him get into character, he was also recognized for carrying a strong performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>clout that comes with being a part of such a project -- is invaluable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>We imagine Gordon-Levitt's math to fit in Steven Spielberg's 2012 release "Lincoln" went something like this: "historical drama + Spielberg as director + Daniel Day-Lewis as president + Sally Field as my mom = sold."</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Although his part was small by comparison, the experience -- and the clout that comes with being a part of such a project -- is invaluable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>After a whirlwind 2012, Gordon-Levitt ever-so-slightly eased up on the gas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Instead of starring in four films in 2013, he chose to star in one -- which he also happened to write and direct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>The romantic comedy "Don Jon," about a New Jersey playboy's porn addiction, puts the 32-year-old back in the role of a romantic interest, but in a Casanova way that he never quite broached before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>And we like it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>"Don Jon," co-starring Scarlett Johansson, is also Gordon-Levitt's feature directorial debut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>(CNN)"Fraggle Rock," the long-in-the-works adaptation of the Jim Henson 1980s puppet TV show, is getting a shot in the arm with the help of Joseph Gordon-Levitt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>The actor has come aboard to star in and produce the feature adaptation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>He joins New Regency and The Henson Co., who also are producing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>"Rock" was a Canadian series that became a hit internationally (it played on HBO in the U.S.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>It followed the adventures of a group of cave-dwelling puppet creatures called Fraggles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>In their world was a race of small, industrious creatures named Doozers, who lived in the caves, as well as the Gorgs, furry giants who looked at Fraggles as nuisances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Regency initially partnered with Ivan Reitman's The Montecito Picture Co. to produce the adaptation, hiring Jim Byrkit and Alex Manugian to write the script, as well as John Stevenson (the co-director of "Kung Fu Panda") to direct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Gordon-Levitt's boarding indicates the project is getting a fresh start, and a new director and writers will be hired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Gordon-Levitt recently wrapped an untitled Christmas comedy with Seth Rogen and Anthony Mackie and currently is shooting Oliver Stone's "Snowden."</td></tr>

<h3>EU agrees Russia sanctions to stay until Ukraine peace terms met</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The compromise reached at an EU summit in Brussels maintains EU unity on sanctions against Moscow over its role in the Ukraine conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Strains have been growing within the 28-country bloc over sanctions which some member governments have only supported reluctantly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>EU governments were divided on whether to act now to renew economic sanctions on Russia which expire in July or to wait several months before taking a decision to see if the Ukraine ceasefire holds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>EU leaders backed a compromise hammered out by European Council President Donald Tusk together with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, two of the architects of the Ukraine peace plan reached in Minsk last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Leaders "agreed that the duration of economic sanctions will be clearly linked to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements, bearing in mind that this is only foreseen by the end of 2015", Tusk told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>EU leaders were also "ready to take further decisions if necessary", he said, in a clear threat of additional sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A formal, legal decision on whether to extend sanctions on Russia's financial, defense and energy sectors that expire in July will only be taken at the next EU summit in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But the link to the Ukraine peace agreement effectively extends economic sanctions until the end of the year because the Minsk accord sets a year-end deadline for Kiev to recover full control over its border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The agreement only referred to economic sanctions, however, leaving open the possibility that some of the visa bans and asset freezes the EU has imposed on scores of Russian and Ukrainian citizens and organizations could be lifted before year-end if the situation in eastern Ukraine improved, EU diplomats said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"If things deteriorate on the ground, we will strengthen sanctions. If, on the other hand, the situation remains stable and improves, then we might envisage a re-examination of the scale of the sanctions package and possibly ease it," a French diplomatic source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some EU ministers have said an offensive by pro-Russian separatists against the port of Mariupol would trigger stepped-up sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Merkel made clear when speaking to Germany's lower house of parliament earlier on Thursday that economic sanctions on Russia would not be eased until the terms of Minsk had been fully met.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We cannot and will not lift the sanctions that expire in July or September until the demands of the Minsk agreement have been fulfilled. That would be wrong," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Minsk agreement, which set out a series of steps to defuse the Ukraine crisis including a ceasefire and withdrawal of heavy weapons, came under renewed strain on Wednesday, with Ukraine and Russia clashing publicly over the next steps and further Ukrainian military casualties from rebel attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Merkel also spoke by phone to U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday and they agreed there would be no easing of sanctions until Russia had fulfilled all of its commitments under Minsk, the White House said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said EU leaders should discuss renewing existing sanctions or scaling up sanctions if Russia failed to implement the Minsk deal, but he rejected any talk of easing the measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"If Putin splits the unity ... among the leaders of the EU member countries, this will be the biggest success story of President Putin and this will be a disaster for the free world," he told reporters in Brussels after a pre-summit meeting with Tusk on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Yatseniuk also said the EU had not yet responded to Ukraine's request for U.N. peacekeepers or an EU police mission to monitor the ceasefire.</td></tr>
