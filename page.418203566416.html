<h3>Emails show top U.S. officials knew about Hillary Clinton's private email address</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during a news conference at the United Nations in New York, in this March 10, 2015, file photo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The majority of Americans, including many Democrats, favor an investigation into whether Hillary Clinton turned over all emails related to her official duties as secretary of state, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>WASHINGTON -- Senior Obama administration officials, including the White House chief of staff, knew as early as 2009 that Hillary Rodham Clinton was using a private email address for her government correspondence, according to some 3,000 pages of correspondence released by the State Department late Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Clinton's emails have become an issue in her 2016 presidential campaign, as Republicans accuse her of using a private account rather than the standard government address to avoid public scrutiny of her correspondence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>As the controversy has continued, Clinton has seen ratings of her character and trustworthiness drop in polling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, requested Clinton's email address on Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>5, 2009, according to one email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His request came three months after top Obama strategist David Axelrod asked the same question of one of Clinton's top aides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But it's unclear whether the officials realized Clinton, now the leading Democratic presidential candidate, was running her email from a server located in her home outside New York City -- a potential security risk and violation of administration policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The emails, covering March through December 2009, were posted online as part of a court mandate that the agency release batches of Clinton's private correspondence from her time as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The continuing release of Clinton's correspondence all but guarantees a slow drip of revelations from the emails throughout her presidential campaign, complicating efforts to put the issue to rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Clinton has said she wants the emails released as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Clinton is also under fire from the Republicans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A Republican-led Congress panel that is investigating the deadly 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, is also examining emails of Clinton and other former department officials, raising the possibility of further revelations into 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The State Department provided more than 3,600 pages of documents to the committee on Tuesday, including emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Pushing back, the Clinton campaign released a video on Wednesday that argues that seven previous investigations have debunked the conspiracy theories surrounding the attacks that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, and the Congressional panel's sole purpose is to rough up Clinton politically ahead of the presidential election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"How long will Republicans keep spending tax dollars on this political charade?" the video asks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The emails ranged from the mundane details of high-level public service -- scheduling secure lines for calls, commenting on memos and dealing with travel logistics -- to an email exchange with former President Jimmy Carter and a phone call with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Carter mildly chided Clinton about how to handle the release of two hostages held in North Korea, while Clinton recounted that Rice, her predecessor, "called to tell me I was on strong ground" regarding Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Clinton's correspondence from her first year as the nation's top diplomat left little doubt that the Obama administration was aware that Clinton was using a personal address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Emanuel, now the mayor of Chicago, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Axelrod said Wednesday that while he knew Clinton had a private email address, "I did not know that she used it exclusively or that she had her server in her home."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The White House counsel's office also was not aware at the time Clinton was secretary of state that she relied solely on personal email and only found out as part of the congressional investigation into the attacks, according to a person familiar with the matter.</td></tr>
