<h3>Ex-Georgian President Named Governor of Ukraine Region</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili on Saturday was appointed governor of Ukraine's troubled Odessa region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko posted the appointment announcement on his website and presented Saakashvili to officials in Odessa city, the region's capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Odessa is Ukraine's largest seaport and has additional strategic importance as the major city between the Russia-annexed Crimean peninsula and the Moldovan separatist region of Transdniester, which is supported by Russian forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Although the city has not been hit by the fighting between government forces and separatists in the east, tensions between nationalists and pro-Russians have been strong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Last May, 48 people died in violence between supporters of both sides, most of them pro-Russians who took shelter in a building that caught fire after opponents threw firebombs into it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Saakashvili's appointment could aggravate relations with Russia that have been severely damaged by the Crimea annexation and the fighting in the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Russian President Vladimir Putin disdains Saakashvili, who came to power in the 2003 Rose Revolution protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Kremlin points to those demonstrations as the beginning of the so-called "color revolutions" that it contends are engineered by the West to overthrow legitimate governments that pursue ties with Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Under Saakashvili, Georgia fought a short war with Russia in 2008, in which it lost control of two Russia-backed separatist territories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He faces accusation of abuse of power at home, and Ukraine last month rejected Georgia's request for his extradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There was no immediate Kremlin comment on his Odessa appointment, but Andre Purgin, a top eastern Ukraine separatist leader, called it "mockery and an absolutely unprecedented step."</td></tr>
