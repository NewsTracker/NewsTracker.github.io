<h3>Interview with Gopal Krishna Gandhi</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A day before the unveiling of the statue of Mahatma Gandhi at the historic Parliament Square by prime minister David Cameron and India's finance minister Arun Jaitley, TOI decided to quiz him on the relevance of Gandhi in modern times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>How relevant is Mahatma Gandhi today?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>As much if not more that when he lived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Not just because he had the answers to our ills but because he was willing to acknowledge that he didn't have all the answers, that he was fallible, a mere experimenter with truth and not with its patent holder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Gandhi said in Delhi in Nov 1947 when the city was reeling under communal rights that whenever he sees a crime committed, he thinks he is the culprit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That is where his relevance comes in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Instead of saying I am not guilty or saying I am the answer, we need political, religious and corporate leaders to take responsibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Thereby they must make other culprits accountable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If these leaders had the attitude of Gandhi what a change that could bring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>How do you think his reaction would be to terrorism and ISIL for example?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Can a Gandhi still be a force to face them and defeat them with the doctrine of nonviolence?</td></tr>

<h3>Steve Jobs Refused Apple CEO Tim Cook's Liver Transplant Offer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But Jobs refused, yelling at Cook that he'd "never let [him] do that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The incident is described in the upcoming Becoming Steve Jobs biography by veteran technology reporter Brent Schlender and Fast Company executive editor Rick Tetzeli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The magazine excerpted a portion of the book, which comes out on March 24, in an article posted online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>According to those excerpts, Cook had his blood tested and found out that, like Jobs, he had a rare blood type and guessed that it might be the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He also did research and discovered that a living person can transfer a portion of their liver to someone in need of transplant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Since the liver is a regenerative organ, the book explains, both the transplanted portion and the remaining portion of the donor's liver will be become whole organs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cook made the offer to Jobs at his predecessor's Palo Alto home, Fast Company explains, but Jobs refused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He cut me off at the legs, almost before the words were out of my mouth," Cook said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Indeed, in the book excerpt, Cook recalls that Jobs "popped up in bed" and said, "No, I'm not doing that!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His reaction marked one of the few times Jobs yelled at Cook during the 13 years they knew each other, Cook says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Somebody that's selfish, doesn't reply like that," Cook adds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Jobs died in 2011 after a battle with pancreatic cancer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Cook was officially named Apple's CEO a few months prior to Jobs' death as Jobs' health was failing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A rep for Apple has not yet responded to The Hollywood Reporter's request for comment.</td></tr>
