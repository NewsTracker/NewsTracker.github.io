<h3>Hillary Clinton may have broken federal record-keeping laws</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The newspaper said the likely Democratic presidential candidate conducted all her official business during her four-year tenure at the State Department on a private email account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It added that Clinton, who stepped down as secretary of state in 2013, recently handed over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department in response to a department effort to comply with record-keeping practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Federal law says letters and emails written and received by federal officials are government records that must be retained, according to the paper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Regulations at the time Clinton served as secretary of state called for emails on personal accounts to be preserved as well, the paper said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Times said most experts believed private email accounts should only be used for official government business in emergencies, according to the Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A spokesman for Clinton told the Times that Clinton was complying with the "letter and spirit of the rules" and had expected her emails would be retained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He declined to detail why she chose to conduct business from her personal account, the Times said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Responding to the report, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the department last year asked former secretaries of state through their representatives to submit any records in their possession to improve record-keeping and management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"In response to our request, Secretary Clinton provided the department with emails spanning her time at the department," Harf said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Clinton's spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Clinton is widely considered the front-runner for next year's Democratic presidential nomination if she decides to enter the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Her inner circle is currently discussing accelerating the formation of a campaign organization to April or May instead of waiting until the summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With no definite opponents to the democratic presidential nomination, Clinton has felt no rush to jump into the race, but having a campaign team in place would allow her to respond forcefully to various accusations fired her way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It would also allow her to raise the millions of dollars needed for a campaign.</td></tr>

<h3>Timeline details ties between Fort Worth police chief, Taser</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- February 2014: Taser gives Fort Worth an estimate for providing 400 Axon body cameras and a five-year subscription to its Evidence.com storage program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>- March 4, 2014: Taser salesman Andrew Grayson informs Halstead the company will give a discount if the contract is signed by March 31.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Halstead responds: "Close of the month? I do not wear a cape or have x-ray vision you know... I'm working it but losing millions to the Academy project hurt us bad."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>- March 14: Halstead writes Grayson: "FYI...I was very successful today getting the first of my 2 approvals."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>- March 16: Grayson reiterates the March 31 deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Our CFO and exec team agreed to the huge discount and net terms in order to get it in this quarter ... I feel there is a 99.9 percent probability that this deal will be taken off the table - even if 24 hours short. That said, what can we do to help convince the city manager to sign with you prior to that? Let's get creative!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>- March 17: Halstead tells Grayson: "I have ONE more small hurdle but I did my job this morning ...someone should give me a raise."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He writes another email telling Taser representatives the City Council will vote March 25 and "I have the votes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>- March 25: Council approves contract worth up to $2.7 million over 5 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>- April 27-29: Taser pays for Halstead to attend a technology summit at its Scottsdale, Arizona headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He delivers a speech, posted on Taser's website, in which he praises its body cameras, Evidence.com and customer service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>- June 10: Taser asks the city to adopt a software upgrade that would save officers' time uploading video but cost an additional $108,000 annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Halstead responds angrily: "It would have been MUCH easier if I would have known this when structuring the current contract. I have literally exhausted all spending accounts (including political capital) and could not even fathom approaching Council on this any time in the near future ... I cannot even discuss this in a public setting because it will appear we were taken advantage of. Our Council will go absolutely nuts and I would not blame them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Taser agrees to give the upgrade at no cost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>- July 16-17: Taser pays airfare and lodging for Halstead to be a guest speaker at a marketing event in Miami.</td></tr>
