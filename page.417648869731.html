<h3>Who's Who in music streaming: Apple, Spotify, Pandora & more</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple shook up the music world more than a decade ago when it offered an easy way to buy songs digitally for 99 cents each.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Now, it's trying to do it again with a subscription music streaming service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Several services charge $10 a month to let you play any of millions of tracks on mobile devices and even download them for offline listening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Once you stop paying, though, you lose all your songs, even ones you've already downloaded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some offer free versions with ads and other restrictions, such as song selection only on PCs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>- With last year's purchase of headphones maker Beats, Apple got Beats Music, which offers unlimited listening and offline playback for $10 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That is evolving into Apple Music and will have a prominent spot on iPhones and other Apple devices, as well as a unique integration with Siri, Apple's voice-activated digital assistant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Apple Music, set to debut June 30, will also be $10 a month, after a three-month free trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The whole family can sign up for $15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>- Spotify is one of Apple Music's biggest competitors in this space, with 60 million active users worldwide, and a quarter of them paying subscribers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It also offers the ability to pick and play tracks on PCs for free with ads; on mobile devices, non-paying users can play albums, artists or playlists they want but with tracks in random order, also with ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>- Rhapsody, operating as Napster in some countries, offers unlimited music for $10, along with a hybrid service called "unRadio" for $5 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It's basically ad-free Internet radio with the ability to save up to 25 favorites for playback anytime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>- Tidal and Deezer also offer high-fidelity CD-quality song streaming, which audiophiles tend to prefer over MP3s and other formats that reduce quality in the compression process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Tidal offers music video and curated playlists from experts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Both charge $10 a month for standard sound quality and $20 for high-fidelity, although discounts can reduce this price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>- Rdio offers full on-demand listening for $10, or a $4 hybrid service that allows 25 tracks to be picked and played on mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>- Besides the main on-demand features, Slacker's twist on a hybrid plan is a $4-per-month "Radio Plus" that allows for Internet radio stations to be listened to offline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>- Google Play Music service also offers unlimited on-demand listening for $10 a month, with no free option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Google also offers a service called YouTube Music Key for selected music videos, free of ads, for $10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Paying for one gets you the other, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>YouTube itself, which is free with ads, is possibly the world's favorite free option for music, whether you watch the video or not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>- Amazon offers on-demand unlimited listening with a $99-a-year Prime membership, though the song selection is very limited compared with rivals.</td></tr>
