<h3>Baltimore's mayor grapples with crime and police</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake speaks at a press conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BALTIMORE - On the day after Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake fired her police commissioner last week, a man was doing a brisk business selling DVDs from a folding table in front of a Baptist church in West Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A block away, a CVS Pharmacy stood as a reminder of riots in April, its windows still boarded with plywood, its red brick stained by black smoke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the talk at the DVD stand was of the latest trauma here: a surge in killings that has mothers keeping their children indoors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And the consensus, in that riot-scarred neighborhood at least, is that the mayor, and not the ousted commissioner, Anthony W. Batts, is to blame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Batts was made to be the fall guy. To save herself, the mayor fired him," declared Woody James, 50, a burly out-of-work deliveryman, as he perused the movies for sale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At that, the DVD salesman, Tony Morse, a city worker on his day off, chimed in: "Fire her, too!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ms. Rawlings-Blake, 45, a Democrat, learned long ago that being black does not insulate her from criticism in this majority black city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Even before the death of Freddie Gray, whose fatal spinal cord injury in police custody set off the April unrest, she walked a fine line in trying to repair what she has called the "broken relationship" between residents and the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Now the surge in violent crime - as of Wednesday there had been 155 homicides in Baltimore this year, up from 105 in the same period last year - has made the mayor's balancing act even trickier: Can she rein in a Police Department with a long history of aggressive, sometimes abusive behavior and at the same time bring crime under control?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ms. Rawlings-Blake, who last month became the first black female president of the United States Conference of Mayors, is hardly the only American mayor facing this question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While the deaths of unarmed black men after confrontations with the police over the past year have spurred debate over police use of force around the country, violent crime has also been ticking up in many places.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Homicides are higher than a year ago in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, St. Louis and other cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti recently announced a 12 percent increase in overall crime, though killings were down slightly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But unlike most of those cities, Baltimore bears fresh physical and emotional wounds of unrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>So the challenge for Ms. Rawling-Blake, who faces re-election in 2016, is all the more complex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I think her biggest challenge is that she has to demonstrate that Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake is the leader of the city of Baltimore, and that she can manage the city," said Edward Reisinger, the City Council vice president, who called for Mr. Batts's ouster on Wednesday hours before she fired him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"As far as I'm concerned, she was doing a good job, but with the civil unrest, I think it lowered her stock."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ms. Rawlings-Blake says she has already proved that she can make the city safer and improve police-community ties; in 2011, on her watch, there were 197 killings in Baltimore - the lowest number in a decade - and, her office says, brutality complaints dropped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She frames her challenge another way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The challenge is rebuilding the hope and the spirit of a traumatized community," she said in a brief interview Thursday after attending a night basketball league game that featured police officers and firefighters shooting hoops alongside teenagers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The vitriol directed at her does not surprise her, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"There are scars. There's anger. We have been through a very rough time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Ms. Rawlings-Blake grew up around civil rights and politics; her father, Howard Rawlings, known as Pete, was a civil rights activist and one of the most powerful men in the Maryland legislature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>At 25, with his help, she became the youngest member of City Council in Baltimore history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In 2010, when Mayor Sheila Dixon was forced out by scandal, Ms. Rawlings-Blake, who was the Council president, became mayor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>She kept the job after winning an election in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But the populist Ms. Dixon is trying to stage a comeback and has just announced that she would challenge the mayor in the Democratic primary next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Ms. Rawlings-Blake dismissed any potential threat - "She's not going to be able to run away from her record," she said of Ms. Dixon - but here in West Baltimore, support for Ms. Dixon runs deep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Partly that is because Ms. Dixon is regarded as more of a woman of the people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But people blame the mayor for a slow police response to the riots, and for urban blight and persistent poverty, problems that predate her time in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Look at the streets," said Jackie Washington, 54, a chiropractic assistant, waving an outstretched arm to take in a littered thoroughfare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"It's a mess. It's depressing to come here, to see the things that you see - people getting shot in broad daylight."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Following a week of rioting and protests, six Baltimore police officers have been charged in the death of Freddie Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Meet the Press" moderator Chuck Todd reacts to comments made by Speaker of the House John Boehner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>This is not the reaction Ms. Rawlings-Blake envisioned in 2012 when she brought in Mr. Batts, a former chief in Oakland and Long Beach, Calif., who likes to call himself "a change agent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He was hired over the objections of one of the mayor's closest allies, City Councilman Brandon M. Scott.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Mr. Scott preferred Anthony E. Barksdale, who had overseen the department's operations when crime was declining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Mr. Barksdale retired last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>With his tough approach to internal discipline and community-minded initiatives-he called for officers to wear body cameras - Mr. Batts, who is also black, rankled the rank and file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>But his support in the community began to erode after the riots; an alliance of prominent ministers quickly called for him to resign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"That's not going to happen," he said then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Even as homicides ticked up - almost half the killings in Baltimore this year have happened after May 1 - the mayor stood by him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>But pressure on her built in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>On Monday, The Baltimore Sun sparked an uproar with an opinion article by a man who had been mugged while riding his bicycle and found his local police station closed overnight when he arrived to report the crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Mr. Reisinger, the Council vice president, called it "stupid with a capital S."</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>On Wednesday morning, a community coalition called for Mr. Batts's head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The City Council began circulating a letter asking the mayor to oust him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>The police union issued a report calling the riots "preventable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>By afternoon, Mr. Batts, 55, was gone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Ms. Rawlings-Blake said Mr. Batts had become "a distraction" that hindered the more pressing imperative to fight crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Some critics wonder what Mr. Batts's removal will really change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>"I'm going to be frank with you: I think this looks like a desperate move," said Delores Jones-Brown, a former New Jersey prosecutor and founder of the Center on Race, Crime and Justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>She predicted that it would be hard to replace Mr. Batts with someone equally as community-minded, "who will try to change the crime situation, but who won't be heavy-handed or brutal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Ms. Rawlings-Blake says she is convinced she can do both; she spent part of Thursday visiting Baltimore police commanders with her interim commissioner, Kevin Davis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>A day earlier, he told reporters that, for him, "it's all about the crime fight, and it's all about the relationship with the community."</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Councilman Nick Mosby - to the husband of Marilyn J. Mosby, the prosecutor who brought charges against six officers in the death of Mr. Gray - said Ms. Rawlings-Blake had learned, perhaps the hard way, a lesson that all mayors ultimately learn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>"I don't care what race you are or how old you are, I don't care if you are the mayor of New York City or the mayor of Mayberry," said Mr. Mosby, who is often mentioned as a possible mayoral candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>"Public safety is paramount in the way people judge effectiveness. It's one of the sole barometers of: Is this person a leader or not?"</td></tr>
