<h3>Graphic novel 'Intergalactic Nemesis? invades the stage</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jason Neulander's graphic novel "The Intergalactic Nemesis, Book Two: Robot Planet Rising" will be performed at Zellerbach Hall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On Robonovia, the robot planet, Molly Sloan and Timmy Mendez desperately search for the missing commander El-Bee-Dee-Oh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Will Soviet spy Natasha Zorokov foil their plan?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Will the destruction of Robonovia mean the end of planet Earth?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tune in to "Intergalactic Nemesis, Book Two: Robot Planet Rising" to find out answers to all of this and more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Two years ago, Jason Neulander's "live-action graphic novel" "Intergalactic Nemesis" made its Bay Area debut, courtesy of Berkeley's Cal Performances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That installment, "Book One: Target Earth," introduced local audiences to the concept of three actors, a sound effects guy and a musician performing a 1940s-style radio show, while vividly colored panels of a comic book filled the screen above them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That Bay Area visit by this enterprise born in Austin, Texas, was successful, so book two is on its way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>No word yet if "Book Three: Twin Infinity," which premiered last fall, will make a Bay Area stop - but Neulander, speaking from his Austin home, did have some thoughts on book two and his "Intergalactic" empire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Q: Do you need to have seen the first installment to enjoy "Robot Planet Rising"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A: Absolutely not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>No previous "Intergalactic" experience necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The story stands alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Book two is, like any good middle part in a trilogy, a little bit darker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It has more characters and is more complex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I've never been more satisfied with the final product of my storytelling than I have been with this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It's sophisticated and goofy and fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It's kind of an edge-of-your-seat whodunit that leads to a supersonic adventure story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>And it's hysterically funny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Q: Given that you're essentially doing a live radio show and a slide show, why do you think modern audiences, so used to high-tech entertainment, have embraced this form?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A: I have no idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>I created the project to push my own personal entertainment buttons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>I've always believed the best theater creates an experience in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, and I had that idea in mind when we were developing the idea of a live-action graphic novel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>I love this kind of storytelling - being taken on a journey - and I guess other people feel similarly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Sometimes less is more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Q: You've completed the "Intergalactic" trilogy, and you're working on a crime novel, "Salt," a spin-off of book one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Any plans for another live-action graphic novel?</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A: Yes, though nothing "Intergalactic"-related.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>We're just in the beginning stages of looking to adapt a really outstanding, classic, public-domain adventure book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>I can't say more, but one of the entities engaged in this discussion is Cal Performances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Intergalactic Nemesis, Book Two: Robot Planet Rising: 8 p.m. Friday, March 6.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>$11-$42, subject to change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Cal Performances, Zellerbach Hall, UC Berkeley.</td></tr>
