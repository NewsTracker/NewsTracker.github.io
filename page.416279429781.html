<h3>Fears that Greece is on the brink of a default send the country's bond yields soaring</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON - Mounting fears of a Greek debt default have sent the country's borrowing costs in the markets surging higher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The latest jitters were stoked by a report Thursday in the Financial Times that Greece made an "informal approach" to the International Monetary Fund to have its bailout repayments delayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Citing unnamed officials from both sides, the newspaper said Athens was persuaded not to make a request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>For investors, the report was unsettling and the yield on Greece's 10-year bonds surged a whole percentage point to just under 13 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece owes the IMF around 1 billion euros ($1.06 billion) in repayments next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Many in the markets think the Greek government will struggle to make those payments if it doesn't agree an economic reform package with European creditors soon.</td></tr>
