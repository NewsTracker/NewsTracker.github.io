<h3>Ex-'Survivor' Producer Convicted of Wife's Murder in Mexico, Sentenced to 12 Years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Beresford-Redman, a former producer on Survivor and the co-creator of the reality show Pimp My Ride, had been charged with the aggravated murder of Burgos during a family vacation to the Moon Palace Resort and Spa hotel during the spring of 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We are appalled and disgusted with this gross miscarriage of justice," said Juanita and David Beresford-Redman in a statement on Thursday, immediately following the announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Over an exhausting three and a half year period this trial has done nothing but prove Bruce's innocence beyond any doubt," they wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Whatever lies behind this ruling it is based on neither facts nor evidence. This is a disservice to Monica's memory; this is not the justice she and Bruce still deserve and that we continue to demand."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Burgos' murder made international headlines in 2010 after a hotel worker found her body dumped in a sewage cistern at the Moon Palace hotel a day after Bruce had reported her missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The couple's two children, Camilla and Alex, 5 and 3 at the time, also were on the vacation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Burgos' body was found mangled and bloated by a hotel maintenance worker on the morning after Burgos' disappearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>After an initial investigation, Beresford-Redman returned to his home in California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Mexican authorities soon issued an extradition request, and in 2012, a U.S. magistrate sent him back to Mexico, where he has remained ever since, awaiting trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Throughout the trial, Mexican prosecutors insisted on Beresford-Redman's guilt even though forensic evidence failed to back up their theory and successive witnesses either backed out or gave testimony that backed up Bruce's repeated claims of innocence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Thursday, Beresford-Redman's Mexico-based attorney said that he would file an appeal "immediately."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"They have nothing against him; this is just to justify his conviction," Cancino said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"There's no surprise here. I believe it's political."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We are just going to keep going on, working the appeal, and hoping this will be the end of it," said Juanita Beresford-Redman, adding: "We've told the children, told them that it's a farce."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Burgos' two sisters have said they believe Bruce is their sister's killer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The sisters' lawyer, Alison Triessl, did not return a call for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Mexican Attorney General in Cancun also did not answer phone calls to his office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>After CBS aired a show last year in which Beresford-Redman took videos of himself from prison speaking frankly about the challenges of living behind bars, he was stripped of all his privileges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>As of this week, he is housed in the "Albatross" cell of the Benito Juarez prison, a section reserved for newly arrived inmates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He is sleeping on the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Cancino says that the first appeal will take place in Cancun state court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>If that fails, he will file a federal appeal and, if necessary, take the case all the way to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"He will come home one day," said Juanita Beresford-Redman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"He definitely will come home."</td></tr>

<h3>Obama banters with Kimmel, reflects on Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>After enduring the routine - in which celebrities read hostile Twitter comments about themselves - Obama told Kimmel, "You should see what the Senate says about me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The president also joked about the perks and restrictions he faces, revealing that he's not allowed to use cellphones that have recorders in them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(Hence his ever-present BlackBerry.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He also noted that he can visit the dentist in the White House basement but doesn't text and can't drive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kimmel asked if that was because you have to have a birth certificate to get a driver's license.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Obama - whom Kimmel introduced as the "first Kenyan-born Muslim Socialist ever elected president" - deadpanned that Kenyans "drive on the other side" of the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>With Sean Penn waiting in the wings, Obama said he was quite familiar with Penn's 1982 coming-of-age comedy "Fast Times at Ridgemont High."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I lived it," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I didn't just see it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kimmel spared the president from questions about the latest controversy involving the Secret Service - although Kimmel's security guard and sidekick, Guillermo Rodriguez, dressed in a full Secret Service getup of dark suit and sunglasses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The glasses, Kimmel joked, were simply hiding a hangover: "Secret cerveza."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Obama's appearance on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" fulfilled a commitment the White House made after he had to postpone an appearance last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>During a more subdued segment, Obama reflected on Wednesday night's shooting of two police officers in racially tense Ferguson, Missouri, just days after he had delivered a speech on racial healing in Selma, Alabama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"What had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and was worthy of protest, but there was no excuse for criminal acts," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Whoever fired those shots should not detract from the issue - they are criminals, they need to be arrested. And then what we need to do is make sure that like-minded, good-spirited people on both sides - law enforcement, who have a terrifically tough job, and people who understandably don't want to be stopped and harassed just because of their race - that they are able to work together to come up with some good answers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>After the "Kimmel" taping, Obama attended a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at the Santa Monica home of Chris Silbermann, president of ICM Partners, one of the top talent agencies in Hollywood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The event was closed to the press, but a Democratic official said the event attracted about 25 people who each paid up to $33,400.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Friday, Obama is flying to Phoenix to hold a roundtable event on veterans' health care.</td></tr>
