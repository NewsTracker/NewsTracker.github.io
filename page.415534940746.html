<h3>4 more aid workers flown back to US for Ebola monitoring</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>On Tuesday, March 17, 2015, health officials said four more medical aid workers have been flown from West Africa to the United States, for monitoring for Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The latest arrivals bring to 16 the number of aid workers evacuated in the last week from Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Four more American aid workers arrived back in the United States on Tuesday from West Africa to be monitored for Ebola, health officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The latest arrivals bring to 15 the number of aid workers who have returned from Sierra Leone since Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>None of them have been diagnosed with Ebola, but they will be isolated and monitored during the next three weeks for signs of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Officials have released few details, citing patient privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But all are connected to - or had direct physical contact with - another American who came down with Ebola last week in Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The unidentified man is in critical condition at a National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The other aid workers are staying near the Maryland hospital or hospitals in Atlanta and Omaha with special isolation units - in case they become sick, according to officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The sick American works with Partners in Health, a Boston-based international aid organization that has been treating patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone since November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Organization officials did not respond to calls and emails from The Associated Press on Monday or Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In a statement Tuesday, co-founder Dr. Paul Farmer said the group is working with the CDC and others to investigate how the man was infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Ebola virus is spread through contact with a sick patient's blood or bodily fluids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The World Health Organization estimates the virus has killed more than 10,000 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>While deaths have slowed dramatically in recent months, the virus appears stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Since last summer, several U.S. aid workers have gotten Ebola and have been flown back to the U.S. for care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A few other individuals have returned for monitoring; none got sick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The aid workers who have returned since Friday are by far the largest group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>And more may be on their way later this week, CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harben said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The sick American worker was working at a government hospital in Port Loko in western Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But medical superintendent Dr. Peter George said the hospital hasn't had any Ebola cases for quite some time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He said it's likely the man also worked at a nearby Ebola treatment center, which George also manages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>George said a Partners in Health colleague told him the American passed out while at the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"At that time, nobody knew it was Ebola, so they assisted him," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Everyone who was working on the ward with the man is now being monitored, George said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He said that many of the foreigners working in Port Loko, including some of the Americans, live at the same tent camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He did not know if the sick health worker was living there.</td></tr>

<h3>Police: School bus hits, seriously hurts 7-year-old in Idaho</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The first-grader was in an unmarked crosswalk when he was struck in Nampa, a small city about 20 miles west of Boise, police Sgt. Joe Ramirez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was walking to school with an older brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The boy's aunt, Rashell Okrakel, said the bus stopped for the older brother, but it then began moving, hitting the younger child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The impact threw the 7-year-old several feet and knocked him unconscious, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Okrakel said that the boy suffered a fractured skull and was in in a coma, though she didn't know if it was medically induced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He had a broken shoulder, arm, leg and ribs, she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Other injuries included a ruptured spleen and two bruised kidneys, Okrakel said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ramirez noted that the boy was alert, awake and crying when officers arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He was taken to a Boise hospital and then flown to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, where a spokeswoman said he was in critical condition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She said she wasn't authorized to provide additional information without the family's approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The collision is under investigation, and no citations have been issued to the 75-year-old driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Neither police nor the bus driver's employer, Brown Bus Co., would release her name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Brown Bus operating manager Brent Carpenter said the driver is distraught and has been placed on paid administrative leave for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Carpenter said the company has launched its own investigation, and would wait to see what it and police find before acting further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Carpenter said the aunt's description of the accident was inconsistent with his understanding of what took place, based on the evidence he saw and his conversations with the driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But he declined to say what he thinks occurred because the investigation is still underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The situation is very unfortunate, but it happens so quickly (the driver) didn't have any time to react," Carpenter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's one of those that could happen to anybody, whether you're in a bus or a personal vehicle."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The boy attends Centennial Elementary School, Nampa School District spokeswoman Allison Westfall said.</td></tr>
