<h3>Iraq forces 'encircle IS in Tikrit'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>State-run al-Iraqiya TV said government forces were "advancing" but progress has been slowed by roadside bombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Security sources said they had captured villages and oil fields east of the city, and blocked a key IS supply line to neighbouring Diyala province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The offensive is being overseen at least in part by an Iranian general.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Tuesday, the top US general said Iran's role in Tikrit could be positive, as long as it did not fuel sectarian tensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some 30,000 soldiers and militiamen from the Popular Mobilisation (Hashid Shaabi) force, backed by Iraqi jets and helicopters, have advanced gradually since the offensive began on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Wednesday, a source in the Samarra Operations Command told the BBC that government forces had taken control of the village of al-Maibdi, on the road between Tikrit and the Kurdish-controlled city of Kirkuk, as well as the nearby Ajil and Alas oilfields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The road was a key supply route for IS between Salahuddin and Diyala provinces, the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Another official told All Iraq News that the villages of Siha and Mazraat al-Rahim, just to the north of Tikrit in al-Alam district, had also been retaken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However, the soldiers and militiamen have not breached IS defences around Tikrit and al-Dour, a town 19km (12 miles) to the south, which officials say is another stronghold of the jihadist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Military officials said on Tuesday that al-Dour had been surrounded and sealed off, but that an assault on the town had not yet been launched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Can Iraq's army dislodge Islamic State?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A senior army commander said the operation was focused on preventing IS from launching more attacks, and cutting supply lines to stop reinforcements and weapons reaching Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The next step would be to "surround the towns completely, suffocate them and then pounce," Lt Gen Abdul Amir al-Zaidi told the AFP news agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gen Zaidi said progress along roads into Tikrit had been slowed by sniper fire and roadside bombs planted by IS militants since they seized Saddam Hussein's hometown last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On one 8km (5-mile) stretch of road, soldiers found about 100 mines and bombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Troops taking part in the offensive have so far not received the support of US-led coalition aircraft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Coalition officials said air strikes had not been requested by the Iraqi authorities, but there are reportedly concerns about the prominent role of Iran and its allied Shia militia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force, was said on Tuesday to have been directing operations from near the frontline east of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He was seen alongside the leader of the Popular Mobilisation, Abu Mahdi al-Mohandis, and Transport Minister Hadi al-Amiri, who heads the powerful Badr Organisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Iranian troops are also reportedly operating artillery, rocket launchers and aerial drones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Gen Martin Dempsey, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Tikrit campaign signalled a new level of Iranian involvement but added that it could turn out to be "a positive thing".</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"This is the most overt conduct of Iranian support, in the form of artillery and other things," he said in a response to questions from members of the Senate armed services committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The UN warned that the operation had to be conducted "with full respect for fundamental human rights principles and humanitarian law" after militia leaders vowed to seek revenge for the massacre of hundreds of soldiers, most of them Shia, at Camp Speicher near Tikrit in June.</td></tr>

<h3>Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, British Man Fighting With Kurds Against ISIS, Is Killed In Syria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, an ex-Royal Marine, was shot dead March 2 in the front-line village of Tel Khuzela, Kurdish commander Redor Khalil told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Another foreign fighter battling with the Kurds, American Jordan Matson, said he was with the body on Wednesday and was working on getting the remains back to Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We're trying to make contact with his mother to see what her wishes are," Matson told the AP Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Otherwise, he wished to be buried here under an olive tree."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Matson said on his Facebook page that Scurfield also had Greek citizenship and had served in the Greek army and as a British Royal Marine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Scurfield was 25 years old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dozens of foreign fighters have traveled to Syria and neighboring Iraq to fight with Kurdish militias battling the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Matson and four other foreign nationals told the AP last month that they arranged to join Kurdish forces through the Facebook page run by the People's Protection Units, or YPG, the main Kurdish militia fighting in northern Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At least one other foreign fighter, Australian Ashley Johnson, who went by the name of Ase, is known to have been killed fighting alongside the Kurds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Islamic State group, which currently holds territory in a third of Iraq and Syria, has recruited thousands of foreign fighters, mainly from Europe and elsewhere in the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Scurfield's parents, Chris and Vicci Scurfield, are archeologists who live in a former farmhouse in the village of Royston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In an interview with Sky News on Wednesday, his mother said the family is "reeling" from the news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honor, and we are very proud of him," the family later said in a media statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The British Foreign Office said it is aware of reports that a British national died in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"As we do not have any representation in Syria it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British nationals there are extremely limited," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Dan Jarvis, the local member of parliament from Barnsley Central, where Scurfield is from, said Wednesday that the Briton traveled to Syria to provide humanitarian aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"My understanding was that he went there for honorable reasons," Jarvis told Sky News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"There are other ways in which people who have these legitimate concerns can make a contribution, supporting charities or NGOs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The advice is rightly not to go there," Jarvis added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Neither the U.S. nor the U.K. have banned citizens from fighting with militias against the Islamic State group, though both consider the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK, a terrorist organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The PKK, which waged a long and bloody insurgency against Ankara, is believed to have close ties to the YPG and is fighting alongside it in northern Iraq and in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Australians are forbidden by law from fighting with any force outside of the Australian national army.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Australia was also one of the first countries to criminalize travel to Syria's al-Raqqa province, where the Islamic State group has established the de facto capital of its self-styled caliphate.</td></tr>
