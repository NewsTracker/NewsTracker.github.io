<h3>Robert Durst Arrested in New Orleans</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Durst, the (estranged) 71-year-old scion of an extremely wealthy New York City real-estate family, was arrested on a warrant issued in California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The details of the warrant were not released on Sunday morning," the New York Times reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the warrant was issued by the Los Angeles Police Department. Officials did not immediately return calls for comment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As those familiar with his story already know, Durst is suspected of murdering his friend Susan Berman, who was shot to death in her Los Angeles home in 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The L.A. Times reports that "the arrest warrant says Durst is connected to a first-degree murder. But a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told The Times it is the Berman slaying. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was ongoing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Durst's lawyer, Chip Lewis, told the Associated Press that his client will be transported to Los Angeles to face charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An FBI spokesperson told the L.A. Times that Durst was arrested in a J.W. Marriott hotel, where he'd checked in under a fake name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Durst was standing in the lobby about 4:30 pm when the agents approached him," the L.A. Times reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"He was mumbling to himself and agents had watched him wander aimlessly for a few minutes, according to a source familiar with the investigation. Once agents identified themselves, Durst was cooperative and taken into custody with out any resistance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Last week's episode of The Jinx ended with Berman's stepson, Sareb Kaufman, showing filmmakers Marc Smerling and Andrew Jarecki a letter Durst mailed to Berman in 1999.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The handwriting on the envelope (as well as a distinctive misspelling of "Beverly Hills") appeared to match that of an anonymous note informing the LAPD of a "cadaver" at Berman's address shortly after her death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As of the filming of the episode, investigators had not seen the letter, which Kaufman said he recently discovered in a box of Berman's things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Durst is also believed to have been involved in the unsolved 1982 disappearance of his first wife, Kathie Durst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Robert durst just arrested in new orleans!!!!!</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Durst definitely killed (and dismembered) his Galveston, Texas, neighbor Morris Black in 2001, but he got off by claiming self-defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He spent three years in prison after pleading guilty to tampering with evidence and skipping out on his $1 billion bail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>This time, he's being held without bond.</td></tr>
