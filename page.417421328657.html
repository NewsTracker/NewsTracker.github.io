<h3>Greece, creditors agree on need for quick deal as talks continue</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece and its European creditors agreed on the need to reach a cash-for-reforms deal quickly as Athens missed a self-imposed Sunday deadline for reaching an agreement to unlock aid, sources close to the talks said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Athens and its euro zone and International Monetary Fund (IMF) creditors have been locked in talks for months on a reforms agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Without a deal, Athens risks default or bankruptcy in weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The pressure has intensified in recent days as Athens faces a payment to the International Monetary Fund on June 5 as well as the expiration of its bailout program on June 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The government said this week it was looking for a deal by Sunday, but sources close to the talks at the so-called Brussels Group of EU/IMF creditors said that was unlikely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a phone call on Sunday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande - the second in four days - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras pushed for a political solution for the country's economic troubles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"(The teleconference) took place in a very good climate," a Greek official said, adding that all three recognized the need for a quick deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tsipras has long sought a political push to end negotiations and get aid flowing to his cash-strapped country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the lenders have insisted that Greece must wrap up talks at the technical level with adequate concessions on reforms so that its budget and debt numbers add up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In a column published on French daily Le Monde's website on Sunday, Tsipras said Greece should not be blamed for not yet reaching a deal with its creditors and called on fellow European leaders to bypass technical talks and come to a political solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"If we have not reached an agreement with our partners, it's not because of our intransigence or incomprehensible positions from the Greek side," Tsipras wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It is rather because of the obsession of some institutional representatives who insist on unreasonable solutions and are being indifferent to the democratic result of recent Greek elections."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said the Greek government had been ready to make compromises, for instance on privatizations, despite its ideological opposition to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Labor and pension reforms are believed to be among the big sticking points with Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Another source close to the talks said the major issues holding up a deal remained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Earlier, a Greek government official speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two sides were "very close" to a deal but one was not expected on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It was not immediately clear if the talks would continue in Brussels on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In an interview published in newspaper Corriere della Sera on Sunday, Greek Economy Minister George Stathakis said he expected a deal in "a few days", followed by a meeting of euro zone finance ministers to approve disbursement of the aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Asked whether the 300 million euro ($329.49 million) payment to the IMF on June 5 was at risk and there was a question of lumping it together with other installments that fall due next month, Stathakis said: "There shouldn't be any need. No danger."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Athens has frequently said it is on the verge of a deal in recent weeks but international lenders have been less optimistic, citing Greece's resistance to labor and pension reforms that are conditions for more aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In a sign of greater willingness to compromise, Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis said on Saturday that Greece was open to pushing back parts of its anti-austerity program to reach a deal this week..</td></tr>
