<h3>Kenyan official: 1 student killed, 141 hurt after explosion</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - One Kenyan student was killed and 141 injured in a stampede Sunday on the campus of the University of Nairobi when students mistook several accidental explosions for an extremist attack, according to an official.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One male third-year student was killed in the crush of students, Peter Mbithi, Vice Chancellor of the University of Nairobi, told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The injured students have been taken to hospitals for treatment, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said an electrical transformer exploded and students thought it was an attack by Islamic extremists like the April 2 attack by Somalia's al-Shabab rebels on Kenya's Garissa University College in which 148 people were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Describing the Nairobi incident, Mbithi said: "It was around 5 a.m. and the transformer at the campus exploded about four or five times which made students mistake it for an attack," said Mbithi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Most of them jumped out of their hostels thinking it was an al-Shabaab attack ... There was no attack but because of what happened in Garissa the other day they mistook it for an attack."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mbithi said many students were injured when they jumped from upper floors of their dormitories.</td></tr>
