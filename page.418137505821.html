<h3>Greece to shut banks and introduce capital control</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece will introduce capital controls and keep its banks closed tomorrow after international creditors refused to extend the country's bailout and savers queued to withdraw cash, taking Athens' standoff to a dangerous new level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Athens stock exchange will also be closed as the government tries to manage the financial fallout of the disagreement with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece's banks, kept afloat by emergency funding from the European Central Bank, are on the front line as Athens moves towards defaulting on a 1.6 billion payment due to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece blamed the ECB, which had made it difficult for the banks to open because it froze the level of funding support rather than increasing it to cover a rise in withdrawals from worried depositors, for the moves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said the decision to reject Greece's request for a short extension of the bailout programme was "an unprecedented act" that called into question the ability of a country to decide an issue affecting its sovereign rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This decision led the ECB today to limit the liquidity of Greek banks and forced the central bank of Greece to propose a bank holiday and a restriction on bank withdrawals," he said in a televised address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Amid drama in Greece, where a clear majority of people want to remain inside the euro, the next few days present a major challenge to the integrity of the 16-year-old euro zone currency bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The consequences for markets and the wider financial system are unclear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greece's left-wing Syriza government has, for months, been negotiating a deal to release funding in time for its IMF payment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Then suddenly, in the early hours of Saturday, Mr Tspiras asked for extra time to enable Greeks to vote in a referendum on the terms of the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Creditors turned down this request, leaving little option for Greece but to default, piling further pressure on the country's banking system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The creditors want Greece to cut pensions and raise taxes in ways that Mr Tsipras has long argued would deepen one of the worst economic crises of modern times in a country where a quarter of the workforce is already unemployed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Long lines formed outside many ATMs today, including some of 40 to 50 people outside some in central Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Bank of Greece said it was making "huge efforts" to ensure the machines remained stocked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Meanwhile the German foreign ministry has appealed to tourists heading to Greece to take plenty of money as to avoid problems with local banks.</td></tr>
