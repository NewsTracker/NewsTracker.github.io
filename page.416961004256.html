<h3>Former FIFA VP Temarii banned 8 years for taking money</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA has banned former vice president Reynald Temarii for eight years for taking Qatari powerbroker Mohamed bin Hammam's money to pay legal costs in a corruption case linked to the 2022 World Cup vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Temarii breached five sections of FIFA's ethics code when he accepted 305,640 euros ($343,000) from Bin Hammam in January 2011, FIFA said on Wednesday in announcing the ethics committee's verdict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>By agreeing to fund Temarii's legal fight against FIFA in the weeks before the World Cup vote, Bin Hammam ensured the Oceania Football Confederation could not take part.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was mandated to support Australia, one of Qatar's four rivals in the 2022 contest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Temarii, then the OFC president, was appealing a one-year suspension by FIFA which barred him from voting in the 2018 and 2022 contests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Russia and Qatar, respectively, won the polls of FIFA's executive committee in December 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>FIFA had three weeks earlier judged the official from Tahiti guilty of breaking confidentiality and loyalty rules by discussing the World Cup votes with undercover reporters from The Sunday Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Had Temarii accepted his one-year ban without appeal, the OFC could have sent his then-deputy, David Chung of Papua New Guinea, to vote for Australia in his place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Sunday Times' reports in October 2010 alleged widespread corruption and vote-buying offers in the World Cup contests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The resulting fallout which damaged the reputation of FIFA and the integrity of the votes persists today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Temarii's FIFA colleague, Amos Adamu of Nigeria, was also barred from the World Cup vote and served a three-year ban from football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Four former FIFA executive committee officials also served bans in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Temarii returned to the FIFA fold when he helped his native Tahiti organize the Beach Soccer World Cup in 2013.</td></tr>
