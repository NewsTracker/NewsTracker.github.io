<h3>Martinez picks Republican for New Mexico Senate vacancy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a statement, Martinez said she would pick Ted Barela, a former mayor of Estancia, to fill the reminder of Griego's term, which expires 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I have great confidence that Ted will work hard to represent the residents of District 39 well and believe he's committed to working with legislators from both parties to diversify our economy and improve our schools," Martinez said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The six counties that make up Senate District 39, which stretches from San Miguel to Valencia counties, had forwarded the names of nominees to the governor last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The list included Santa Fe County Commissioner Liz Stefanics, former San Miguel County Commissioner Hugh Ley and former Santa Fe County Commissioner Jose Varela Lopez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Three counties nominated Stefanics, a Democrat, as their pick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Griego, D-San Jose, held the seat for more than 18 years but submitted his resignation last month because of an ethics issue that stemmed from his role in the sale of a state-owned building in Santa Fe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Griego was one of several lawmakers who approved the sale last year of a building that used to belong to the state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The buyer, Galisteo Street Inc., later hired Griego to act as its agent in the purchase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Griego was promised a $50,000 commission fee if the sale closed, according to a copy of the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Griego said his resignation was necessary "to avoid a major distraction to the important work that needs to be accomplished for the families and children throughout the state of New Mexico."</td></tr>
