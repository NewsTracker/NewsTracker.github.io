<h3>Boris Johnson urges Tories to give more people the Right to Buy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He called for a dramatic extension of Margaret Thatcher's flagship Right to Buy policy to be a centrepiece of his party's general election manifesto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 2.5million people in housing association properties should be given discounts to buy their homes - while ownership of some houses should simply be transferred to the hardest-working tenants, he argues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Both ideas, also supported by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, are understood to be being 'seriously considered' by the party leadership for its manifesto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The London Mayor said the Tories could not 'simply shrug their shoulders' about the gap between the pay of City fat cats and ordinary workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They must be seen to be 'championing policies that help people on low incomes and help working people', such as a living wage and extending the right to buy in order to win in May, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'We need a levelling up,' he insisted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Mayor said he did not mind being stopped wherever he goes by people seeking 'selfie' pictures with him - insisting it would be a key feature of this election campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Yesterday he was stopped hundreds of times by voters seeking selfies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He was also persuaded to purchase black pudding on a visit to Bury market, and presented with a Manchester tart as he dropped in at a baker's stall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She said afterwards: 'I love Boris because he's genuine.' Another voter who asked for a selfie, Jacqui Fallon, from Heywood, said she was intending to vote Ukip but added: 'I'd vote Tory if he was prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said he was aware of the risk of posing with an unknown 'undesirable', but said: 'What can you do about that?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I don't think that fundamentally matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Of his Manchester tart, Mr Johnson said it would be 'taken back in style' to London for consumption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Johnson yesterday embarked on a tour of marginal seats in the North West, prompting chaotic scenes as he descended on Bury and Marple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Scores of people stopped the London Mayor asking for 'selfie' pictures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He is being deployed by chief Tory campaign strategist Lynton Crosby in constituencies where he is considered more popular than the party leadership, including much of the north and in London, a traditionally Labour-dominated city he has won twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Yesterday Mr Johnson sought to play down his own leadership prospects, claiming he believed his father Stanley, who admitted this week to putting a 20 bet on him to be the next prime minister, would 'lose his money'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He said he accepted Mr Cameron's suggestion that if the Tories remain in power, a Cabinet post will have to wait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>'As ever, the Prime Minister is right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>I have got a massive job to do in London till 2016 and will continue to discharge my mandate,' Mr Johnson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But he went on to set out his own, expansive vision of a compassionate conservatism - and challenge Mr Cameron on key issues, including migration policy and defence spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He said he backed a huge extension of the right to buy to all housing association homes as part of a Tory push to demonstrate that the party is on the side of the hardworking poor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The current Right to Buy rules allow most council tenants to buy their homes at a discount, but the rules do not apply to housing associations, non-profit making bodies that provide low-cost social housing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They are regulated by the state and receive public funding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Tenants only qualify for limited discounts and can only buy a property that has been acquired by an association since 1997.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Discounts vary between areas, but range from 9,000 to 16,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Council house tenants, by contrast, can get discounts of up to 77,000 across England and 102,700 in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Top Gear presenter is the victim of 'left-wing hysteria', Mr Johnson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>'I think there's a left-wing hysteria about him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He's the standard bearer for unacceptable attitudes which makes me instinctively want to support him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>'Clearly they have to work out what happened, and you can't go round belting people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Mr Johnson said he supported extending generous discounts to all, as well as a still more radical idea - handing over housing association properties to tenants once they had been in work for an extended period, perhaps a year or more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The association would retain a 40 per cent stake, ensuring taxpayers gain from an increase in house prices, while the new owners would be given the remaining 60 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Money raised when the property was sold would be ploughed back into more social housebuilding, which would be spread out rather than concentrated on estates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The policy would be designed to echo Baroness Thatcher's defining right-to-buy policy for council house tenants, and to appeal to more 'C2 voters' - the skilled working classes who helped to deliver her three election victories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>As well as boosting home ownership and rewarding work, the scheme would also dramatically reduce the vast housing benefit bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Currently, taxpayers subsidise the housing costs of many unemployed and lower paid workers who live in housing association properties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Mr Johnson said: 'The principle of giving people the pride of home ownership, a motivating force to get people off benefits, to get them as active members of our economy - that's a good one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>It deserves serious exploration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Mr Johnson became the latest senior Conservative to call for the party to commit to maintaining a defence budget of at least two per cent of GDP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>'Yes, I think David Cameron was right to call for NATO countries to spend two per cent at the Cardiff NATO summit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>I think the world is getting no safer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>'But I think we need clarity from the MoD about how that money will be spent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>'Both bits of it need to be looked at.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Actually giving people a council house is very radical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>We need to look at how we can do it without seeming to create an unfair windfall for these tenants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>But there might be ways of doing that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>'We need to think of ways of addressing the feeling of people in the next door house who may be renting in the private sector and think "why is this person being gifted this very valuable property?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>'There are ways of addressing that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>We could stagger it, we could extend the period for which you have to be off benefits, make sure there's some element of the sale value so that you had to pay something back over a certain period of time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>'We need more homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>That's the number one priority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Mr Johnson called for the Tories to champion other policies for the low-paid, such as the living wage and further extensions of the personal allowance for income tax, to persuade voters that they will benefit from the economic recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>'The sun is coming out, but for many people it has been very difficult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>It's also the case that people feel the recovery has been uneven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>There is a problem with wealth inequality in my view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>I don't think we can be completely relaxed about that,' Mr Johnson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>'Human beings judge themselves by how they relate to other people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>That's just a fact of life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>You can't be unaffected by the fact that people at the top of many corporations are being paid many, many, many multiples of the incomes of people at the bottom, and that gap is increasing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>'That's significant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>That's not something Conservatives can just shrug their shoulders about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>We need to have a levelling up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Britain must build more bungalows for older people to free larger houses for families, Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>He said anyone wanting to move should have the option - but they should also be able to have their existing home adapted if they want to stay put.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>'We should be championing the living wage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>We should be championing policies that help people on low incomes and help working people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>'That's why we have brought in measures in London to support part-time workers who need to commute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>'These are the absolute backbone of our economy: people who have to travel long distances every morning to jobs on low incomes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Under the original Right to Buy scheme, introduced by Lady Thatcher in 1980, more than 1.5 million homes were sold off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Mr Johnson rejected suggestions the Tory campaign has so far been too narrow, saying it was 'exactly right' and declaring that Mr Osborne 'played a blinder' in this week's Budget, which yesterday appeared to have given the Tories a poll lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>After watching the solar eclipse, the Mayor likened it to his party's economic record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>'I think the solar metaphor is completely apposite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>For thousands of years people would have been completely terrified about the astronomic event this morning,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>'They would have thought the great life force had been extinguished and that growth would not return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Denying that the eclipse had been underwhelming, glimpsed only through heavy cloud, Mr Johnson insisted: 'It was amazing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>David Cameron's failed target to reduce net migration has damaged the economy and should not be maintained, the Mayor said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>He insisted what while he wanted immigration properly 'counted and controlled', the numbers wanting to come to Britain to work was a positive sign of the health of our economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>'I think whatever you do with migration you've got to be straight with people about what you can achieve,' Mr Johnson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>He attacked Labour for 'taking the brakes off' and allowing 'a free-for-all' which had corroded public trust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>But he added: 'To have net emigration of talented people from your country is not a good thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>To have net migration, to have a large number of talented people who want to come is a compliment to Britain and a compliment to the way the economy is running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>'To give you one striking fact: In Paris at the moment there are 16,000 Britons, while in London there are 400,000 people from France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>That shows the relative attractions of the two countries and the relative dynamism of London and Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>'Politicians need to point out that immigration is a positive symptom of something that is happening in the economy but they need to be able to count and to control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>The problem is that we have had is that we have had a complete asymmetry between the EU free for all and the non-EU constriction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>'In order to meet that target [of reducing net numbers to under 100,000] we've been driven to suppressing migration from countries like Australia and Canada, Chinese IT experts or whatever, in a way that I don't think has been necessarily good for the economy, while being doing absolutely nothing about the EU immigration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>'I think the Prime Minister understands that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>Only the Conservatives are offering people the chance to do that and tackle the pull factors that are drawing people in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>'Where politicians go off the rails is where they say they can stop something or change something which they can't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>In an ideal world we would have a policy that pointed out to people the benefits to the economy of having talented people come here while having the ability to count and control.</td></tr>
