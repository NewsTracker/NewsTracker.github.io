<h3>Students creates product to improve March Madness brackets</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But forget what you thought you knew about comparing brackets, because one college entrepreneur has created a product to change the way fans can share their picks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Over the past year, Hanson Grant, a junior at Babson College created the Think Board, a clear adhesive that turns any smooth surface into a dry erase board, with help from his brother Garrison Grant, a senior at Siena College.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The brothers and self-described life-long sports fans from Saratoga Springs, New York, didn't stop there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Think Board is now set to come out with a limited edition March Madness Think Board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Similar to the original Think Board, the March Madness edition will still act as a portable adhesive and dry erase board, but will now include college basketball's March Madness bracket with the respective teams printed directly on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Garrison, who plans to root for Kentucky, says he is extremely excited for the product's upcoming release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"March Madness is the most fun tournament to watch," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"What better way to keep track of your picks than a Think Board on the wall."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One reason this product can improve bracket sharing is due to its increased size of 22" x 16, says Hanson, who plans to root for Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Previously, fans may have used the standard 8.5" x 11" piece of paper, which may have not had enough space for a full-sized bracket, he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"People need a new way to follow their picks," Hanson says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Competition or not, it's better to have your picks up on the wall and large, then on some small sheet of paper."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Now, due to the increased size of Think Board's bracket, fans have more space to write their predictions, making it easier to share picks publicly, such as on dorm room walls, walls of bars or anywhere else, Hanson says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This makes the competition of seeing who's gonna dance more fun and public, and gets the tournament and your brackets more attention," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Think Board is a unique product that will allow me to display a large bracket in my house so that everyone living there can see the current status of the tournament," says James Eschner, a sophomore at Cornell University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It will enrich the competitive atmosphere and allow for a new and exciting March Madness tournament experience."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Students who have purchased the March Madness edition Think Board say it's because of its increased size, ease and the product's ability to keep things from getting "messy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It can be a room centerpiece during the duration of the tournament," says Alex Watkins, fellow Babson College junior who plans to root for Minnesota in the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"You can keep track of who has the best bracket between friends. It will help with making a bracket because it's extremely easy to change your picks and not get messy. You can write down stats for certain teams and then quickly erase them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Hanson, along with Think Board owner Lee Rodems, a sophomore at Binghamton University, say they believe the Think Board brackets will help build more hype around the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I'm looking forward to the March Madness edition because of its large display," says Rodems, who plans to root for Michigan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It'll add to the excitement of the tournament."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Thanks to its size and portability, the improved bracket isn't just for sharing amongst friends, it is perfect for bars and offices as well, Hanson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Twenty-five bars across the state of New York have already purchased the product, along with others in the Boston area, Hanson says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The official list of teams who will have earned a tournament spot was announced March 15, Selection Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Grant brothers will print and ship all Think Board brackets by to ensure that buyers will receive their brackets in time for the first round games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But that's not all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Those who purchase the Think Board March Madness bracket have the opportunity to enter into Think Board's March Madness bracket challenge, and get the chance to win a $250 gift card to Chipotle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>To enter, simply Tweet, Instagram or Facebook a picture of your Think Board bracket with the hashtag #ThinkBoard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The competition will run through the March Madness tournament and winners will be notified following its completion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>At the reduced price of $20, buyers will also receive the Think Board kit, which includes proper cleaning supplies and dry-erase marker.</td></tr>
