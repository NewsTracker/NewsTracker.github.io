<h3>Apple gives green light to marijuana app, Massroots</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple has reversed course and decided to allow a marijuana app to be included among its store offerings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Massroots - a social network for marijuana users - announced in a blog post that Apple changed its mind and will allow the app for those living in one of the 23 states that currently have medical and recreational use marijuana laws, United Press Internationalreported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple at first prohibited the app because of its company's anti-drug policy.</td></tr>
