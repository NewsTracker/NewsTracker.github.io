<h3>Apple Watch fashion gurus?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks about the Apple Watch during an Apple event at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California, Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>9, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The job description of Apple retail employees will soon change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Aside from educating customers on the intricacies of using iCloud, Apple personnel will also have to mutate into style gurus, which is a tall order for people who wear plain blue shirts to work everyday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The change is related to the upcoming release of the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to a report from 9to5Mac, the responsibilities of Apple retail employees will morph as early as next month, and will resemble the duties of sales personnel in luxury stores like Rolex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The article, which named "employees briefed on the plans" as its source, claims that Apple personnel will undergo training for new sales techniques over the next two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The program will teach employees how to give advice on watch and strap choices, as well as giving assistance with gifts and iPhone upgrades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For the training program, Apple has created two "samples personas."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The first one, a girl named Susana who hasn't worn a watch in a long time, has budget constraints but can be convinced to splurge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The second one, a trendy guy named Lee, is looking for something that will look good while he works out or hangs out with friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>To lure in these fictional customers, Apple is telling employees to "build relationships with customers to understand their purchase plans, stylistic wants, and fashion needs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Apple has stopped short of providing an actual script that workers can repeat again and again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>However, it has provided talking points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>For example, Apple retail personnel have been instructed to make comments such as, "You seem to have a fun style. I think the pink Sport band would match your style perfectly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They have also been told to explain how other customers chose their Apple Watch, and to present choices outside of a person's price range just in case there's a chance to upsell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The big day for Apple employees (and the customers who have been waiting for the Apple Watch) is April 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On that day, people will be able to try on the Apple Watch for 15 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The actual release date for the device is two weeks later, on April 24.</td></tr>
