<h3>Greece news: Europe gives go ahead for third Greek bail-out talks - As it happened 17 July 2015</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The EU has confirmed that Greece will get some financial assistance under the terms of the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On 17 July 2015, the Council adopted a decision granting up to &#x20ac;7.16bn in short term financial assistance to Greece under the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The loan will have a maximum maturity of three months and will be disbursed in up to two instalments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It will allow Greece to clear its arrears with the IMF and the Bank of Greece and to repay the ECB, until Greece would start receiving financing under a new programme from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On 16 July the Eurogroup decided in principle to agree to a request made by Greece on 8 July 2015 for stability support over three years from the ESM.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Once negotiated between the institutions and Greece and approved by the Eurogroup, the ESM assistance would be used, amongst other things, to repay the loan Greece receives under the EFSM.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greek and German voters are simply locked in a death spiral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kristian Niemietz argues that Greeks will always resist any reforms imposed from abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Germans will demand such reforms while their cash is on the line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>So they go on, locked together in misery, he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Greece is due to pay &#x20ac;3.5bn to the ECB on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The possibility of missing that payment has always caused a lot of worry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>So just as well that Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner for the eurp, has confirmed that a bridge financing loan will mean Greece has the funds available for that payment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>This has been a week of important decisions in terms of helping #Greece to regain financial stability and put its economy back on track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>We are witnessing the #EU solidarity in action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>While the markets are following developments regarding Greece's financial future, Alexis Tsipras, the country's Prime Minister, is following fires spreading through Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>I can see two helicopters trying to deal with the fires in Argiroupolis on the mountain behind my house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In our comment pages professor Reint Gropp, a German economist and President at the Halle Institute for Economic Research, argues that the German vote is a first important step in the right direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Germany's parliament has approved the bailout, but implementation will be extremely tricky, given that the Greek government does not fully endorse the program and depends on the opposition for implementation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>To help the implementation process, positive results have to become quickly visible, including that banks are able to reopen, wages, bills and pensions can be paid in full and public and private investment can resume.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The plan is tough, perhaps a little too tough, but it does give Greece a chance to resume growth within a year, perhaps sooner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Germany has voted decisively to allow formal talks on a third Greek bail-out to get going.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>No real response in the markets to a quite predictable outcome, with the euro is trading at a steady $1.09.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>German parliament approves opening Greek third bailout talks with clear majority - 439 voted in favour, 119 no, 40 abstained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Once more unto the Greeks dear friends, once more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Or close the ELA up and ditch this hopeless debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>After a few hours of speeches and debate, German politicians are now preparping to vote on whether to approve talks a third bail-out package for Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>They're expected to wave it through, and are the last European country needed to do so, after Austria gave its consent earlier today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>German MPs in the #Bundestag now about to vote on whether to negotiate a third #Greek bailout - there'll be five different votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Reuters is reporting that while Greek banks might be ready to open, they'll still need permission to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>An increase in the funding available to the embattled country's banks has meant that they could be ready to open their doors for the first time in three weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But &#x20ac;60 a day withdrawal limits are likely to remain even if they do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>A senior official at the Greek Banking Association told Reuters: "The banks are ready to open their branches but we have to wait for the final approval from the Central Bank of Greece. There are some technical issues that remain to be resolved, we also have to wait for the government's approval."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The ECB decided to up the cap on emergency liquidity assistance available to Greek banks on Thursday, which was taken to be a show of support for the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>ELA to Greece&#x2019;s banks had been capped at &#x20ac;89bn, interpreted by critics as an overtly political move by the ECB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Sahra Wagenknecht, of Germany's socialist Die Linke party, has said that Germany's politicians will be right back to negotiating Greece again in another year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Mr Schaeuble has admitted that he doesn't have confidence in another bail-out, she said, and the package will be just a drop in the ocean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Speaking in the Bundestag, Ms Wagenknecht noted the IMF's projection that Greek debt to GDP will soon hit 200pc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>She has called the German Government's handling of taxpayer money "shocking".</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Alexis Tsipras, the Greek Prime Minister, managed to survive Wednesday's vote on tougher austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>They were passed, but he's not been left unscathed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Many of his own cabinet rebelled, and he's now expected to shake things up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>In total, 38 of his own party dissented to vote against him, including his energy and welfare ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>A reshuffle is now expected in the next three days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Wolfgang Schaeuble, the German finance minister who's suggested Greece might be off outside of the eurozone, has said that there's no one in the Bundestag who questions the need to help Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"Every individual in the ruling faction was totally agreed on the question of whether Greece should be helped," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>He's said that finding a path that will work for Greece is very complicated, and Europe now faces a last attempt to achieve this very difficult task.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"It's not only about Greece," but about Europe too, he said, and creating a single currency that works for the entirety of the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>The finance minister added that Greece had been doing well until six months ago, and that the two bail-out packages it had received had not failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>But the last six months have made fixing Greece a much more difficult task.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Open Europe is describing Mr Schaeuble as "very animated" during his comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Schaeuble's speech in Bundestag is the one of an outgoing Finance Minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>When will Greece get QE?</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>The European Central Bank's regular survey of professional forecasters is out today, and for a second consecutive quarter, inflation forecasts have been nudged up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Analysts put a lot of that down to the arrival of a long-awaited quantitative easing scheme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>But for now, Greece's bonds are exempt from the programme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Mario Draghi, the ECB president, confirmed yesterday that Greek's sovereign debt doesn't yet meet the critieria for inclusion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>The ECB can only hold 33pc of the debt of a single issuer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>It's already at that cap when it comes to Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Inflation expectations from the ECB's Survey of Professional Forecasters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>But if Greece makes the &#x20ac;3.5bn payment it owes the ECB on Monday, Mr Draghi said that this would take it a step closer to qualifying, taking it below that 33pc limit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>There's another obstacle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Greece's sovereign debt has such a low credit rating that the ECB isn't allowed to buy it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Reinhard Cluse, an economist at UBS, said that a waiver might be granted, which "could happen once a third bail-out is in place".</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>He said that this could open a window for the ECB to buy Greek bonds in the autumn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>But that doesn't mean that QE isn't already helping Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>Asset purchases by the central bank have weakened the euro, and that depreciation will make Greece more competitive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>This assumes that Greece ends up staying in the euro, of course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Sigmar Gabriel, the vice-chancellor and economics minister, has said that the two bail-out programmes Greece has already been granted haven't helped matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>We've underestimated the scale of the problem, he's said in the Bundestag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>And he's not convinced that just cutting debts - as many have called for over the past week - will help either.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Instead, a complete reform of the entire political system is necessary, he's urged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>But his party will say yes to a new bail-out deal, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Gabriel: conditions for a third bailout package are hard, and #Greece government has agreed to necessary but difficult reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>The single currency is on course for its worst weekly performance against the pound in more than six years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Not all of this is related to Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>And in fact, there's an argument to be made that the recent turmoil will have increased the euro's value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>The main drivers over this week have been hints from the Bank of England that interest rates will rise soon, and the European Central Bank's comments assuring investors that it will complete its &#x20ac;1.1bn quantitative easing scheme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>But that doesn't mean that the euro's strength isn't relevant to the Greek situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>The currency's continual depreciation could put Greece in a better position if the current debt crisis is resolved, with the country still in the currency bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>German lawmakers are interrupting their summer recess to return to Berlin for a three-hour floor debate before voting at about 1pm local time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>Finland&#x2019;s parliament gave its approval Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>But in a closed-door test poll after an appeal for support by Merkel, 48 members of her 310-strong caucus said they would break ranks and vote against the government line, a party official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>That compares with 29 who dissented in February on a vote to extend Greece&#x2019;s second bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>#Gysi: This is undemocratic.The people in #Greece have not been heard.Herr Schaueble will decide for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>#Gysi: This is undemocratic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>The people in #Greece have not been heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>Herr Schaueble will decide for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>#Gysi: Merkel you are seen as a strong woman - but Schaueble has been chancellor recently, pushing 'scandalous' ideas of #Grexit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>He accuses Merkel, finance minister Wolfgang Schaueble and economy minister Sigmar Gabriel of "destroying the European idea" and says they are "making the worst political mistake" of their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>#Gysi: Germany needs the Euro more than #Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>You know this Schaueble but daren't say it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>Here are some choice soundbites from Merkel's speech so far..</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>#Merkel: the deal makes clear that there cannot be a haircut in the system of the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>#Merkel: Treaty change and ratification is the way to change EU laws - not through elections in one country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>"I have never seen such as of drama as recently" she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>"Can you imagine how it would be if German pensioners were lining up to get their monthly pension?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>#Merkel: Despite huge political difference, EZ18 wanted #Greece to remain in Euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>Banks are set to open today for the first time in three weeks after the European Central Bank agreed to raise the liquidity it provides to the country&#x2019;s banks by &#x20ac;900m ( 630m), which should tide them over for a short time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>However, capital controls which limit daily cashpoint withdrawals to &#x20ac;60 ( 42) will remain in place, so we're still likely to see queues forming at cash machines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>More calls for Greek debt relief...</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>Now it's France's finance minister, Michel Sapin, who has reaffirmed Paris' view that Greece needs debt relief to allow it to get its economy back on its feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>Sapin, echoing the IMF's Lagarde, told Europe 1 radio that relief could involve measures such as an extension of maturities, lengthening of the grace period on repayment, or easing of interest rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>He ruled out any write-off of Greek loans, saying that as a creditor, France wanted to ensure it got its money back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>Christine Lagarde, the IMF's head, said this morning that the Fund could participate in a "complete" package to put the Greek economy back on track and said the country needed some form of debt relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>Asked on France's Europe 1 whether the IMF would participate in a third bailout for the country, Lagarde said the Fund wanted to see a "complete" program for Greece and listed what that should involve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>"This complete package has two legs, a Greek leg that entails an in-depth reform of the Greek economy. That means holding a budgetary position that is sound and gives the country solidity; and the second leg is that of the lenders, which entails supplying finacing and restructuring the debt to ease its burden," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>Lagarde also argued that Greece needed debt relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>This might not have to be a full write-off, but could involve measures such as stretching loan repayment schedules and reducing interest rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>European Council chief Donald Tusk has given several interviews offering a behind-the-scenes account of how Monday's eleventh hour deal was reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>He said Europe came close to catastrophe as the talks between Greece and its creditors for a new bailout deal last weekend almost failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>He voiced fears that the standoff has given new energy to radical political forces in Europe that has made 2015 resemble 1968.</td></tr>
<tr><td>113</td><td>Tusk also told a Greek newspaper that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had haggled over how much money from a Greek privatisation fund would be earmarked for investment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>114</td><td>"During the negotiations, around 0700 in the morning, when Tsipras and Merkel asked for a break, I felt that the risk that they would fail was very close," Tusk told Kathimerini.</td></tr>
<tr><td>115</td><td>"At that time their difference was only 2.5 billion euros. It was at that point that I told them that if the negotiations had ended without a result, I would have been ready to announce publicly that Europe was close to catastrophe for 2.5 billion euros."</td></tr>
<tr><td>116</td><td>&#x2022; The European Central Bank increased the funding available to Greek banks, meaning that lenders might open for the first time in three weeks on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>117</td><td>&#x2022; Eurozone finance ministers agreed in principle to a &#x20ac;7bn bridging loan to Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>118</td><td>&#x2022; Debt relief's necessity is not controversial, said ECB president Mario Draghi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>119</td><td>&#x2022; Finnish politicians voted for talks on a third Greek bail-out to begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>120</td><td>What next?</td></tr>
<tr><td>121</td><td>&#x2022; This morning the German Bundestag will vote on whether or not to approve a new rescue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>122</td><td>Austria's parliament's will do the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>123</td><td>Both will need to pass a vote by a majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>124</td><td>&#x2022; However, talks over securing a new &#x20ac;86bn bail-out are likely to last for another four weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>125</td><td>The UK Government debt total is now...</td></tr>
<tr><td>126</td><td>Greece: what does the 'No' vote mean?</td></tr>
<tr><td>127</td><td>How big is Greece's debt?</td></tr>
