<h3>CANNES WATCH: Winehouse documentary shows fame's dark side</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - Celebrity-worshipping Cannes got a sobering reminder of fame's dark side Saturday with "Amy," a powerful documentary about the late singer Amy Winehouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I don't think I'm going to be at all famous," a teenage Winehouse says at one point in the film by British director Asif Kapadia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I don't think I could handle it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Winehouse was a global celebrity when she died in July 2011 of accidental alcohol poisoning at age 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The sense that the singer foresaw her fate lends extra poignancy to the film, which is getting its world premiere at a Cannes midnight screening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kapadia, who made acclaimed documentary "Senna" about Formula 1 driver Ayrton Senna - another star who died young - interviewed 80 of Winehouse's friends, family and collaborators for the film, layering their words over footage of the musician from childhood onwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Winehouse emerges as a vibrant personality whose soulful voice and intensely personal lyrics made her a star, but whose struggles with depression, bulimia, drugs and alcohol were worsened by the pressures of sudden fame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Some journalists at a press screening shuffled uncomfortably in their seats at the sight of the media frenzy that surrounded Winehouse after her second album, "Back to Black," made her a star - and her erratic behavior made her tabloid news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Winehouse's parents appear in the film, which is due for release in the U.S. in July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But they have also recently criticized it, calling it "unbalanced" and saying it suggests family members did too little to help the singer overcome her addictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A family spokesman said Winehouse's parents did not plan to attend Saturday's premiere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But no one emerges as an outright villain in the film, which shows how people who cared about Winehouse tried, and failed, to curb her demons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>One of the final shots is of Tony Bennett ranking Winehouse in the pantheon of singers alongside Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's a moving end to a sad, cautionary tale.</td></tr>
