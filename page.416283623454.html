<h3>Dutch shift focus in MH17 crash to investigating culprits</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said, after meeting counterparts from Malaysia, Ukraine and Australia on the sidelines of a cyber-security conference in The Hague, that there was agreement on pushing ahead with justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Now that we're very far with repatriation (of the victims' remains), investigation and prosecution are becoming more central," Koenders said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The ministers believe that prosecution is not only important for the countries with victims onboard. Civil aviation is vulnerable and every safety violation is a concern shared worldwide."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17, and all 298 aboard were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Forensics laboratories in the Netherlands have identified remains of 296 victims and recovered large parts of the wreckage for the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prosecutors are testing the theory that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air BUK missile fired from an area held by pro-Russian forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Because two-thirds of the victims were Dutch citizens, the Netherlands is leading several post-crash investigations.</td></tr>
