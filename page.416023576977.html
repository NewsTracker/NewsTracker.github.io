<h3>Tax filing deadline extended for ObamaCare customers given wrong form</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Treasury Department said Friday that hundreds of thousands of ObamaCare customers who received incorrect tax forms earlier this year will not face penalties for filing after April 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A statement from the department said that anyone who was not sent the correct replacement tax forms and was "unable to file an accurate tax return" would now have until Oct. 15 to file their taxes, as long as they request an extension by the traditional filing deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, the statement said that anyone who had received a correct form and was able to file before the deadline "should do so."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Obama administration revealed in late February that it had sent a tax form containing incorrect information on health insurance premiums to approximately 800,000 HealthCare.gov customers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the time, those people were asked to hold off on filing their taxes for 2014 until a corrected form could be sent out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was not immediately clear how many people had requested or received an extension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At the time the Obama administration acknowledged the error, around 50,000 people had already filed their tax return using the incorrect forms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A Health and Human Services official told Fox News that taxpayers should receive the corrected forms during the first week of March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which is overseeing the ObamaCare rollout, told The Hill that it had taken longer than expected to mail the proper forms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Federal officials had previously announced an extended grace period for people who face a penalty for not having health insurance.</td></tr>
