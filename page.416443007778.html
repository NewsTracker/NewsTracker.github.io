<h3>Facebook's first-quarter sales slightly miss Wall Street's expectations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MENLO PARK - Facebook's sales slightly missed Wall Street's expectations Wednesday, but the company continued to ride the mobile advertising wave in the first quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The social networking company raked in $3.54 billion in sales from January to March, up 42 percent compared to the same period last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Facebook earned $512 million or 18 cents per share in the first quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, on average, estimated that the company would report $3.56 billion in sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Excluding some one-time expenses, Facebook would have earned 42 cents per share, surpassing Wall Street's target of 40 cents per share.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"These results show that we're making progress on our mission to connect the world and we're executing well against our priorities," Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a call with investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"But this quarter also shows how Facebook is continuing to make progress for the years ahead."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Facebook's executives said during the call that the company's sales outside of North America, especially in Latin America and Europe, took a hit because of fluctuations in foreign currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Brian Wieser, an analyst for Pivotal Research Group, called Facebook's growth remarkable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I think it's a really strong number. If there's a miss, it's because of currency," Wieser said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's hurting everybody. You have to account for it, but you can't knock the company's performance on that aspect."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Facebook makes most of its money from displaying ads, and in the first quarter, mobile ad dollars made up 73 percent of its total advertising revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But as Facebook ventures into virtual reality, messaging, video and more, the company is also spending money at a rapid pace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In March, Facebook announced it purchased the shopping search engine TheFind to deliver more relevant ads to people on its website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The price was not disclosed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It has also been trying to grow the number of people who use Facebook's stand-alone messaging app by introducing new features, allowing users to send money through Messenger and businesses to easily interact with its online shopping customers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The company's costs and expenses increased to $2.61 billion in the first quarter, up 83 percent compared to the same period in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Facebook has established investor goodwill that they can execute on their ambitious goals, but it will be incumbent upon them to prove that the decrease in margins - which we model as a long-term outcome - is occurring as the result of high-leverage investments in ad-tech and new businesses," wrote Carlos Kirjner, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., in a note before Wednesday's earnings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>About 1.44 billion people logged into Facebook or used its Messenger app every month in the first quarter, an uptick of 13 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Wednesday, Facebook's stock closed at $84.63 per share, up 1.2 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The company's stock was down in after-hours trading.</td></tr>
