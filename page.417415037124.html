<h3>$100,000 cheque awaits donor of vintage Apple computer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Apple-1, designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak in 1976.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A recycling depot in San Jose, Calif., is trying to track down a woman who dropped off a vintage Apple computer that it sold for $200,000 at an auction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And since its policy is to split proceeds from a sale 50-50 with the donor, they'd like to give her a cheque for $100,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Problem is she didn't leave her contact information with the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clean Bay Area says the Apple I is one of only about 200 first-generation desktop computers built by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ron Wayne in 1976.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Apple-1 (or Apple I) computer originally sold for $600, according to digitaltrends.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The record for an Apple-1 purchase is $905,000, but that was the only remaining model sold personally by Jobs out of his home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I remember her," Clean Bay Area's Victor Gichun told the San Jose Mercury News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"To prove who she is, I just need to look at her."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gichun told the paper that in the future, he'll be more insistent about getting donors' contact information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Have you bought the Apple Watch?</td></tr>
