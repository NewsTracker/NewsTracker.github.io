<h3>Microsoft Cuts 7,800 Jobs In Its Ailing Smartphone Business</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Microsoft is cutting up to 7,800 jobs, which represents nearly 7 percent of the company's total workforce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The cuts are coming primarily from its smartphone business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's evidence that Microsoft's attempt to mount a serious challenge to the leading mobile platforms, Apple's iOS and Google's Android, are not paying off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Microsoft is cutting up to 7,800 jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That's nearly 7 percent of its workforce, and it's mostly from the company's smartphone business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>NPR's Aarti Shahani reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Microsoft bought Nokia, the phone maker, for $9.5 billion in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Now Microsoft says it'll take a write-down of 7.6 billion related to that purchase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And the big job cuts will come primarily from the phone division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>AL HILWA: The strategy of record at the time was to go big in the hardware business and imitate Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>SHAHANI: Al Hilwa is an analyst with IDC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>HILWA: In retrospect, yeah, that did prove to be a mistake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>SHAHANI: Microsoft realized it couldn't make high-end luxury phones to compete with iPhones, and it couldn't beat out low-end phones, the ones under a hundred bucks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>According to IDC, in the first quarter of this year, Microsoft-Nokia had just 2.6 percent share of the global smartphone market, ranking number nine overall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>HILWA: They're not really getting out of the phone business as much as they are focusing on a platform for the phone that is very much a continuation of their PC business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>SHAHANI: Microsoft isn't ditching hardware.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In a statement today, CEO Satya Nadella says the company is changing strategies - less focus on growing a standalone phone business, more focus on growing the Windows ecosystem - getting Microsoft Office and Xbox to work more devices better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The big question is whether this news of layoffs and downsizing will have a chilling effect on partnerships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Frank Gillett, an analyst with Forrester Research, says Microsoft needs other phone makers, like Samsung and LG, to choose to use Windows instead of Google's Android operating system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And Microsoft needs independent developers to be invested in Windows and work on apps that make it a fun, rich environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>FRANK GILLETT: The balancing act that Microsoft will have to do now is reassure developers, hey, we're still in this even though we made these dramatic job cuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>SHAHANI: Microsoft expects to complete most of the layoffs by the end of this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Aarti Shahani, NPR News.</td></tr>
