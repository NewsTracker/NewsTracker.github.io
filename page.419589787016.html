<h3>Islamic State fight: Pentagon investigates claims of skewed intelligence</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington: The Pentagon's inspector general is investigating allegations that military officials have skewed intelligence assessments about the United States-led campaign in Iraq against Islamic State to provide a more optimistic account of progress, according to several officials familiar with the inquiry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The investigation began after at least one civilian Defence Intelligence Agency analyst told authorities that he had evidence that officials at US Central Command - the military headquarters overseeing the US bombing campaign and other efforts against the Islamic State - were improperly reworking the conclusions of intelligence assessments prepared for policymakers, including President Barack Obama, the government officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Fuller details of the claims were not clear, including when the assessments were said to have been altered and who at Central Command, or CENTCOM, the analyst said was responsible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The officials, speaking only on condition of anonymity about classified matters, said that the recently opened investigation focused on whether military officials had changed the conclusions of draft intelligence assessments during a review process and then passed them on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The prospect of skewed intelligence raises new questions about the direction of the government's war with IS, and could help explain why pronouncements about the progress of the campaign have varied widely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Spokeswomen for both inspectors general declined to comment for this article.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Defence Intelligence Agency and the White House also declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Colonel Patrick Ryder, a CENTCOM spokesman, said he could not comment on an ongoing inspector general investigation but said "the IG has a responsibility to investigate all allegations made, and we welcome and support their independent oversight".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Numerous agencies produce intelligence assessments related to the Iraq war, including the Defence Intelligence Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Colonel Ryder said it was customary for them to make suggestions on one another's drafts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But he said each agency had the final say on whether to incorporate those suggestions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Further, the multi-source nature of our assessment process purposely guards against any single report or opinion unduly influencing leaders and decision-makers," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some senior US officials in recent weeks have provided largely positive public assessments about the progress of the military campaign against IS, a Sunni terrorist organisation that began as an offshoot of al-Qaeda but has since severed ties and claimed governance of a huge stretch of land across Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The group is also called ISIS or ISIL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In late July, retired general John Allen - who is Obama's top envoy working with other nations to fight IS - told the Aspen Security Forum that the terror group's momentum had been "checked strategically, operationally, and by and large, tactically".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"ISIS is losing," he said, even as he acknowledged that the campaign faced numerous challenges - from blunting IS's message to improving the quality of Iraqi forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>During a news briefing last week, Defence Secretary Ash Carter was more measured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He called the war "difficult" and said "it's going to take some time".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But, he added, "I'm confident that we will succeed in defeating ISIL and that we have the right strategy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But recent intelligence assessments, including some by the Defence Intelligence Agency, paint a sober picture about how little IS has been weakened in the past year, according to officials with access to the classified assessments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>They said the documents conclude that the year-long campaign has done little to diminish the ranks of IS's committed fighters, and that the group over the last year has expanded its reach into North Africa and Central Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Critics of the Obama administration's strategy have argued that a bombing campaign alone - without a significant infusion of US ground troops - is unlikely to ever significantly weaken the terror group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But it is not clear whether Defence Intelligence Agency analysts concluded that more American troops would make an appreciable difference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In testimony on Capitol Hill this year, Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart, the agency's director, said sending ground troops back into Iraq risked transforming the conflict into one between the West and IS, which would be "the best propaganda victory that we could give".</td></tr>
