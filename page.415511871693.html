<h3>Justice has been served with Robert Durst's arrest: NYPD cop</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>I'm really happy that this will bring some kind of closure for the McCormack family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kathie Durst's brother and sister and mother have suffered through this for 33 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This is not going to give them total closure but perhaps some relief in some ways for their own grief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It's not going to cure anything for them but hopefully it will satisfy some of their sorrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>I watched the documentary like everyone else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>I thought it was compelling, and cops and robber stories don't bring me to my knees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>I thought it was laid out well and Andrew Jarecki did a good job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hopefully, it will be part of a good overall case in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jarecki did a very thorough, comprehensive personal investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He's not law enforcement so he's not bound by all the restrictions that police have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He laid it out fairly well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>When a police officer is dealing with a suspect he's entitled to a Miranda warning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>When you give someone the Miranda warning, they'd have to be a fool to talk to you after that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The New York case against Durst was hard to prove without a body, and without a crime scene we were in a bad position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Durst is a very calculating guy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Don't be fooled by his twitching and blinking during the interviews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He's strange and bizarre but I consider him as smart as a fox.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The very first time I met Robert Durst was when he walked into the 20th Precinct's detective squad unannounced to report his wife missing five days after he last saw her in 1982.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He was very blase about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He lacked emotion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He eventually explained it away by saying it was calming for his wife to stay overnight at the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The fact that he hadn't heard from her meant he wasn't alarmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That gave him about five days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>During that period of time nobody really knows where the hell he was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>I did take a subsequent statement where he told me where he was every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Some of those days were inconsistent with what we later found out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He stated that one of the days he was looking for real estate in Connecticut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>And another day he took his dog to a vet, various places that he tried to cover his trail during that time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Some didn't check out later on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Retired NYPD Det.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Michael Struk investigated Kathie Durst's disappearance in 1982.</td></tr>

<h3>Suspect in Ferguson shooting of police appears in court</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jeffrey L. Williams, 20, has admitted to firing the shots that wounded the officers early Thursday and told authorities he was not shooting at police, Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said on Sunday after announcing the arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Williams gave no statements on Monday and told Judge Joseph Dueker in St. Louis County Circuit Court that he planned to hire a private attorney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He is charged with two counts of first-degree assault, a class A felony that calls for 10-30 years, or up to life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>No one responded Monday at the Williams address listed in court records, a one-story blue house that had trash strewn on the lawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Neighbors declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Police had called the shooting an "ambush" of the officers, who were standing side by side, by a gunman embedded with protesters, but McCulloch said on Sunday that Williams may have been shooting at someone else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Several long-time activists have said they did not recognize or know Williams as a protester.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The shooting of the officers followed a flurry of resignations and protests in the week after the U.S. Justice Department released a damning report accusing Ferguson of racially biased policing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Justice Department, which launched an investigation after Brown's shooting, found pervasive racial bias in Ferguson's policing and municipal court practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Its police force is mostly white and two-thirds of residents are black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, its city manager and its municipal court judge have resigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Williams, who had been on probation for possession of stolen property, is accused of firing shots from a car just as a rally after Jackson's resignation was breaking up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Demonstrations erupted into arson and looting after Brown's shooting in August and again in November when a grand jury declined to bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Police drew criticism for mass arrests and use of gas cannisters, rubber bullets and armored vehicles in the days after Brown's shooting, a response officials said was needed to quell the unrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A U.S. District judge on Monday allowed a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by people arrested in August to continue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The lawsuit names Ferguson, St. Louis County, the chiefs of both departments and other officers as defendants.</td></tr>
