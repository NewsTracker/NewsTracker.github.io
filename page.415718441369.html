<h3>Cubs RHP Edwin Jackson goes to wrong spring training park (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Edwin Jackson might have had a better day if he never found his way to work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Cubs right-hander was scratched from his scheduled start Tuesday when he went to the wrong ballpark, then gave up eight runs when he finally found the right mound in Chicago's 14-2 loss to the Oakland Athletics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jackson said he entered 'Oakland Athletics spring training complex' into his Google Maps app on his phone and it directed him to Phoenix Muni, which is across the street from the Phoenix Zoo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The A's now play at HoHoKam Stadium, the Cubs' former spring training home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Cubs' current complex is less than 5 miles away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''It was my fault for not looking to see where it was,'' said Jackson, who arrived in time to see Cubs prospect Kris Bryant hit his ninth Cactus League homer in the third inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jackson said getting to the park late had no effect on his pitching.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''I was already dressed and got here in time to get ready, but they didn't want me to rush things,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''I came to the stadium with the mindset of being ready.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Blake Parker made the emergency start and gave up a two-run homer to Billy Butler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Jackson entered in the second inning and allowed nine hits - six for extra bases - and eight runs in 1 2-3 innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Stephen Vogt also had a two-run shot for Oakland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''They hit the ball whether it was a good pitch or not,'' Jackson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''They did a lot of damage with two outs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Barry Zito, returning to baseball following a year's absence, extended his scoreless innings streak to 11, allowing one hit in four innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He walked three and struck out two, lowering his ERA to 2.30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''I can only control how I throw the ball,'' Zito said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''I got up to 65 pitches today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Zito keeps things simple.</td></tr>

<tr><td>21</td><td>''When I make my pitches, things have gone OK,'' he said after his third straight scoreless outing.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>A's manager Bob Melvin continues to marvel at Zito's return.</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>He continues to get outs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Former All-Star closer Ryan Cook was optioned to Triple-A Nashville after the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He had appeared in five games, allowing 13 runs over 5 1-3 innings.</td></tr>
