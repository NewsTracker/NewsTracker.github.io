<h3>Human waste on Everest causes pollution, threatens to spread disease: official</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Human waste left by climbers on Mount Everest has become a problem that is causing pollution and threatening to spread disease on the world's highest peak, the chief of Nepal's mountaineering association said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The more than 700 climbers and guides who spend nearly two months on Everest's slopes each climbing season leave large amounts of feces and urine, and the issue has not been addressed, Ang Tshering told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said Nepal's government needs to get the climbers to dispose of the waste properly so the mountain remains pristine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hundreds of foreign climbers attempt to scale Everest during Nepal's mountaineering season, which began this week and runs through May. Last year's season was cancelled after 16 local guides were killed in an avalanche in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Climbers spend weeks acclimatizing around the four camps set up between the base camp at 5,300 metres (17,380 feet) and the 8,850-meter-high (29,035-foot-high) summit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The camps have tents and some essential equipment and supplies, but do not have toilets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Climbers usually dig holes in the snow for their toilet use and leave the human waste there," Tshering said, adding that the waste has been "piling up" for years around the four camps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At the base camp, where there are more porters, cooks and support staff during the climbing season, there are toilet tents with drums to store the waste.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Once filled, the drums are carried to a lower area, where the waste is properly disposed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dawa Steven Sherpa, who has been leading Everest cleanup expeditions since 2008, said some climbers carry disposable travel toilet bags to use in the higher camps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It is a health hazard and the issue needs to be addressed," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nepal's government has not come up with a plan yet to tackle the issue of human waste.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But starting this season, officials stationed at the base camp will strictly monitor garbage on the mountain, said Puspa Raj Katuwal, the head of the government's Mountaineering Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The government imposed new rules last year requiring each climber to bring down to the base camp 8 kilograms (18 pounds) of trash - the amount it estimates a climber discards along the route.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Climbing teams must leave a $4,000 deposit that they lose if they don't comply with the regulations, Katuwal said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>More than 4,000 climbers have scaled Mount Everest since 1953, when it was first conquered by New Zealand climber Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Hundreds of others have died in the attempt, while many have succeeded only with help from oxygen tanks, equipment porters and Sherpa guides.</td></tr>

<h3>Concerns over drug prompt delay of Georgia woman's execution</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ultimately, they postponed the execution of Kelly Renee Gissendaner late Monday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A day later, they decided to temporarily halt executions until they could more carefully analyze the pentobarbital, which is supposed to be clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The cloudy drug bolstered death penalty opponents, who have been vocal in their opposition after three botched executions in other parts of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gissendaner, who was convicted of murder in the February 1997 slaying of her husband, had originally been set for execution last week on Feb. 25, but it was postponed because of a threat of bad weather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Attorneys for Gissendaner said in a filing with the U.S. Supreme Court that a lawyer for the state called them around 10:25 p.m. Monday to say the execution would be postponed several days because the state's pharmacist had looked at the drug an hour earlier and determined it was cloudy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The state's lawyer called back about five minutes later to say the prison wasn't sure which drugs they had checked, "this week's or last week's," and that they were considering going forward, the filing says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The lawyer called a third time, saying "this particular batch (of drugs) just didn't come out like it was supposed to" and they weren't going to proceed, according to the court filing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>About 11 p.m., the state told reporters an independent lab checked its potency and it was acceptable, but it later appeared cloudy and the execution was postponed "out of an abundance of caution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The back and forth was detailed in Gissendaner's emergency motion for a stay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Corrections spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan said "there was never any confusion within the department about the drugs which were to be used," but also indicated the department was not part of the conversations between the attorney general's office and defense attorneys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said in a statement it is "essential that executions are carried out in a constitutional manner" and that he approved of the decision to temporarily suspend executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The cloudiness could be contamination by bacteria or some impurity, said Michael Jay, a professor at the University of North Carolina's Eshelman School of Pharmacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>If the particles were big enough, they could clog blood vessels when injected or could lodge in the lungs, Jay said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It could also make the drug less potent, making an inmate very sleepy but not kill them, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"If it's a solution that's supposed to be clear and it's not clear, it should never be injected," Jay said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"So they did the right thing by not injecting it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Compounded drugs have a shelf life of 30 days, Jay said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Corrections officials declined to say when the department obtained the drug or when it was set to expire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Georgia and other death penalty states have bought execution drugs from compounding pharmacies in recent years after pharmaceutical companies stopped selling to U.S. prisons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And many of them have adopted laws to hide the identity of their drug providers, saying those laws are necessary to protect their suppliers and maintain a source of the drugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Critics say executions should be as transparent as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The cloudy drug "raises significant concerns about Georgia's ability to carry out executions in compliance with the Constitution, but we don't know what really happened," said Megan McCracken of the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law's Death Penalty Clinic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Because of the secrecy surrounding Georgia's procedures, it is impossible to say if this is indicative of a larger problem," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which tracks data on executions, said he's never heard of an execution being halted at the last minute because of a problem with the drug itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Missouri and Texas are also actively using compounded pentobarbital in a one-drug formula for executions, and South Dakota has also used this method, McCracken said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Other states have been using a three-drug combination starting with the sedative midazolam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But executions in those states are mostly on hold pending a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in an Oklahoma case sparked by a botched execution there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Prosecutors said Gissendaner repeatedly pushed her on-again, off-again lover Gregory Owen to kill her husband, Douglas Gissendaner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Owen ambushed her husband while she went out with friends, forced him to drive to a remote area and stabbed him multiple times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Owen and Gissendaner then met up and set fire to the dead man's car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Both initially denied involvement, but Owen eventually confessed and testified against his former girlfriend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Owen is serving a life prison sentence and is eligible for parole in eight years.</td></tr>
