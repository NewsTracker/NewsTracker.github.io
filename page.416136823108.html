<h3>Russia slams Ukrainian law banning Communist-era symbols</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A ministry statement said Friday that the laws "match the distorted ideas that are being propagated by the incumbent authorities in Ukraine" and that they are a pretext for "introducing totalitarian methods to liquidate unsuitable parties."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It contends that recognizing the partisans as freedom-fighters honors "Nazi collaborators."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The laws passed by the Ukrainian parliament on Thursday ban the use of symbols from the Soviet years and also ban Nazi symbols.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Moscow has repeatedly contended that the downfall of Viktor Yanukovych as Ukrainian president in 2014 after months of protests was effectively a coup driven by fascist-minded nationalists.</td></tr>
