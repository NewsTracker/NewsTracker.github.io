<h3>Facebook shares slide even as profit beats forecasts</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A man poses for photographs in front of the Facebook sign on the company's campus in Menlo Park, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Facebook surpassed expectations on all fronts in the second quarter, growing not just profit and revenue but its already-massive user base, mobile advertising and usage of its "family" of non-Facebook apps like Instagram and WhatsApp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Even so, its stock price slid after the results came out, as some investors may have been waiting for even better results, or looking to cash in on some profits as Facebook's shares have been trading near-record highs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Spending also soared in the April-June period, as Facebook had promised it would.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The world's largest online social network said Wednesday that it had 1.31 billion people visiting from a mobile device at least once a month, on average, during the quarter.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>Facebook had 1.49 billion monthly users overall, up 13%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Facebook also had 968 million daily active users overall and 844 million on mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Once again Facebook has proven its ability to attract and retain users. It's particularly impressive that users are more engaged than ever before - that the percentage of monthly users who visit every day continues to grow," said Forrester Research analyst Nate Elliott.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That's in contrast to Twitter, which continues to worry investors with stalling user growth and on Wednesday saw its stock price drop to its lowest level in more than a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Facebook's mobile advertising represented 76% of the total advertising revenue during the second quarter, proof that the company continues to attract advertisers to where its users are - on smartphones and other hand-held gadgets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That's up from 62% a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While still far behind No.</td></tr>
