<h3>Apple in rare territory. Time for a bounce?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple in rare territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Time for a bounce?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Scott Mlyn | CNBC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple has only fallen to its current range seven times since 1990.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Each of those instances was followed by a move higher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apple (AAPL) is in rare territory, now almost 10 percent below its 50-day moving average, a 3.5 standard deviation (SD) move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That is very rare territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It has only been in this range seven times, or 0.1 percent of all trading days since 1990, according to our partners at Kensho.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In each of the seven times the next move has been higher, reverting to its mean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The average time before moving higher over those seven times was 1.9 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bank of America's downgrade of Apple today (on deceleration of iPhone) may put even more pressure on the stock, but the point is, it is due for a bounce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>For those looking for a statistics primer: One standard deviation means there is a 68.2 percent chance it will stay within a given range from the mean, in this case the 50-day moving average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Two standard deviations means there is a 95 percent chance it will be within a given range; three standard deviations means it is 99.7 percent within a given range, and when you get toward four standard deviations...well, it doesn't happen very often, and that's what gets quants and other statistical types to sit up and take notice.</td></tr>
