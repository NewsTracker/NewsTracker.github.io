<h3>Avalanches Kill Nearly 250 In Afghanistan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nearly 200 people have been killed in north Afghanistan in some of the worst avalanches there for 30 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Massive avalanches in a valley not far from the Afghan capital have reportedly killed nearly 200 people, adding to a total of almost 250 deaths from the worst such snow slides in three decades in the country's mountainous northeast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Rescue workers using bulldozers worked to clear roads to the Panjshir Valley area just northeast of Kabul - an area where villagers have been cut off for almost a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gov. Abdul Rahman Kabiri, the acting governor of Panjshir province, said a total 196 people had been killed and dozens more injured in the deadly avalanches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hundreds of homes have been damaged and destroyed, he said, according to The Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Some 50 others were killed in avalanches elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Large parts of Afghanistan have been covered in snow as a major storm interrupted an otherwise mild and dry winter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The heavy snowstorms, which began early Tuesday, hampered rescue efforts. Snowfall from the storm was nearly three feet deep in places, and fallen trees blocked roads in the Panjshir Valley."</td></tr>
