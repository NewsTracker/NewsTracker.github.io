<h3>Germany was told of risk of flying over Ukraine just before flight MH17 was shot down</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The German government had been warned of a heightened risk of flying over eastern Ukraine just days before the MH17 disaster last year, it has been claimed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Despite being told of the risk of flying over Ukraine in diplomatic cables sent two days before the crash, Germany failed to pass on the warning, local media reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17, and all 298 aboard were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>German foreign ministry cables sent on July 15, cited an incident from the day before when a Ukranian air force plane was shot down at around 20,000 feet over rebel-held territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>German intelligence had repeatedly warned of the risk to aviation security, and had assessed the downing of the Ukranian military plane on July 14 as a 'significant development because of its altitude', German public TV channels NDR and WDR and Sueddeutsche Zeitung reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Earlier this month, the Dutch government said that, with nearly all of the victims identified, efforts had shifted to finding those responsible for shooting the plane down as it crossed Ukraine last July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said, after meeting counterparts from Malaysia, Ukraine and Australia on the sidelines of a cyber-security conference in The Hague, that there was agreement on pushing ahead with justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'Now that we're very far with repatriation (of the victims' remains), investigation and prosecution are becoming more central,' Koenders said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'The ministers believe that prosecution is not only important for the countries with victims onboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Forensics laboratories in the Netherlands have identified remains of 296 of the 298 MH17 victims and recovered large parts of the wreckage for the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Prosecutors are testing the theory that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air BUK missile fired from an area held by pro-Russian forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Because two-thirds of the victims were Dutch citizens, the Netherlands is leading several post-crash investigations.</td></tr>
