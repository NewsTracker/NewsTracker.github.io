<h3>The Wire creator David Simon condemns 'selfish' Baltimore rioters</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>David Simon, the creator of The Wire, has called on "selfish" Baltimore rioters to "go home" after violence erupted in the city last night over the death of a young black man at the hands of American police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Rioting broke out in the streets of Baltimore on Monday night after Mr Gray's funeral, as protesters clashed with heavily-armoured police and set fire to cars and buildings in scenes reminiscent of last year's unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Gray, 25, died in police custody on April 19, a week after he was arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An autopsy found that his spine had been effectively severed and video captured by a bystander shows him in obvious agony as police carry him away in handcuffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Although six officers were suspended and Mr Gray's family appealed for calm, it was not enough to prevent an outbreak of violence and a state of emergency being declared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Simon wrote: "There was real power and potential in the peaceful protests that spoke in Mr. Gray&#x2019;s name initially, and there was real unity at his homegoing today. But this, now, in the streets, is an affront to that man&#x2019;s memory and a dimunition of the absolute moral lesson that underlies his unnecessary death."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"If you can&#x2019;t seek redress and demand reform without a brick in your hand, you risk losing this moment for all of us in Baltimore. Turn around. Go home. Please."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Simon grew up in Maryland, attending high school and university in the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In 1982 he moved to the state's largest city to take up a job as a police reporter at the Baltimore Sun in 1982, later writing a book about his experience shadowing Baltimore's police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After quitting journalist he helped create The Wire, the HBO series about police and drug gangs in inner-city Baltimore.</td></tr>
