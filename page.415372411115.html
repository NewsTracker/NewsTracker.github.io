<h3>Ferguson city manager ousted after scathing DOJ report</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lt. Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Al Eickhoff will become acting chief of the police department while the city launches a nationwide search for a new chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told reporters Jackson resigned because he is "an honorable man."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"After a lot of soul searching -- and it is very hard for him to leave and us to have him leave -- he felt that this was the best way forward."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>City Manager John Shaw, 39, the city's most powerful official, quit his post late Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The DOJ report blamed him for overseeing the city's financially driven policies that led to widespread corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He had held the post since 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In a page-long resignation letter, which the city called a "mutual separation agreement," he offered a staunch defense to the DOJ findings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"While I certainly respect the work that the DOJ recently performed in their investigation and report on the city of Ferguson, I must state clearly that my office has never instructed the Police Department to target African-Americans, nor falsify charges to administer fines, nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The report said Shaw played a major role in the financially driven police and court system that was used to bolster the city's coffers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>One email shows Shaw congratulating the police and courts for "great work" as he was told there was a long line of people waiting to pay fines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Shaw's resignation is the second major upheaval in the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Monday, the Missouri Supreme Court took what it called "extraordinary action" to replace municipal Judge Ronald J. Brockmeyer, whom the DOJ accused of ticket-fixing and playing a major role in the city's fee penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Jackson and Shaw were both given one year of severance pay.</td></tr>

<h3>Father of Palestinian killed in Syria says son duped into IS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Islamic State group released a video Tuesday that purports to show the killing of Mohamed Said Ismail accused of being a spy for Israeli intelligence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The father of the Palestinian youth killed by the Islamic State in Syria says his son was no Israeli spy but was tricked into joining the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - The father of a Palestinian killed by the Islamic State in Syria said Wednesday that his son was no Israeli spy but was tricked into joining the militants who killed him after he tried to come back home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Said Musalam said IS lured his 19-year-old son Mohamed with promises of women, money and cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"They promised a lot of things and then I came here and there is nothing," Musalam recalled his son saying in a phone call home from Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The son said he was in Raqqa, the de-facto capital of the Islamic State group, and had heard his mother was sick and wanted to come back, the father added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The father spoke to The Associated Press from the family's east Jerusalem home, a day after IS released a video purporting to show the killing of a captive identified as Mohamed Said Ismail Musalam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the 13-minute video posted online, a militant and a boy dressed in camouflage stand behind a man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The fighter makes a brief statement in French accusing the man of working for the Mossad before the boy steps forward and shoots the captive in the head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The AP could not independently verify the video but it was released by the IS group's Furqan media arm and corresponds to previous IS videos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Israeli Foreign Ministry declined comment while Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency said it announced earlier this year that Mohamed Musalam had left for Turkey to fight with IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The elder Musalam said he was the only one in the family to watch the video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said he saw his son dressed in orange, knew that he was marked for death, and could not watch it through to the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His wife cried and she and other family members were too distraught to watch, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The family said it had begun a customary three-day mourning period, though there will not be a mourning tent because they live in a Jewish area of east Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Musalam said he wished the same fate upon the family of Islamic State group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I will leave it to God and what happened to my son Mohamed I hope God will do the same for you, your sons and your family," Musalam said in Arabic, addressing al-Baghdadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"God knows that one day we'll meet, whether in paradise or in hell, and we'll settle the accounts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After the video was released on Tuesday, Musalam told the AP that his son left for Syria four months ago without telling his family and later told his brother that he was going to fight with IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>More than a month ago, the family received a call from an unidentified person who said Musalam had fled IS, was caught at a Turkish checkpoint, and was put in IS jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"They did not want to let him leave because if he comes back, he might be caught by the Israelis and tell them what he had seen. So they wanted to get rid of him," the father said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I know my son. I raised him well. I am sure he's not working for the Mossad."</td></tr>
