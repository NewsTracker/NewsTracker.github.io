<h3>Netanyahu meant 'no disresepct' to Prez with Congress speech</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In turn, the President said their dispute "is not a personal issue" - and he told Reuters in an interview that he would meet in the future with Netanyahu if the prime minister's party wins the Israeli election on March 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But on the eve of Netanyahu's speech, Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, conveyed a chillier message in a briefing Monday - saying Obama is unlikely to give the speech his attention Tuesday and warning the Israeli leader to watch his words.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I doubt that he will spend his whole time watching the speech," Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He cautioned Netanyahu against divulging details the U.S. has shared with Israel on the status of nuclear talks with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Noting that "the United States has been providing our Israeli allies regular detailed classified briefings" on the Iran talks, Earnest said: "The release of that information would betray the trust between our allies and it certainly is inconsistent with trust between allies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His words came after an Israeli official said the prime minister will give Congress new information on the talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kicking off his trip to Washington with an address to the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee Monday morning, Netanyahu said U.S.-Israeli relations are "stronger than ever."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said he intended no insult by accepting House Speaker John Boehner's invitation to address a joint session of Congress without first informing the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the esteemed office that he holds," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Instead, he said, he was motivated by the urgency of preventing the theocratic state from developing a nuclear bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I have a moral obligation to speak up in the face of these dangers while there is still time to avert them," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"American leaders worry about the security of their country," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Israeli leaders worry about the survival of their country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Administration officials warn the address and any resulting congressional push for new sanctions on Iran could upset the negotiations being conducted in Switzerland by Secretary of State Kerry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Obama offered tough talk on those negotiations in his interview with Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The President said Iran must commit to a verifiable freeze of at least 10 years on its nuclear activity to reach a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"There's no other steps we can take that would give us such assurance that they don't have a nuclear weapon," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Dozens of Democrats say they'll boycott Netanyahu's talk, accusing Boehner of dragging relations with Israel into the U.S. political arena in hopes of embarrassing Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Vice President Biden is skipping the speech, instead traveling to Guatemala.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It is shameful and frustrating that the speaker of the House, with total disregard to protocol and decorum of the House and rules, got us to this point," said Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Nydia Velazquez (D-Brooklyn, Manhattan), who is attending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Two members of New York City's congressional delegation, Reps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Charles Rangel (D-Harlem) and Gregory Meeks (D-Queens), who is traveling with Biden, say they'll take a pass on the speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Another, Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Yvette Clarke (D-Brooklyn,) was on the fence Monday.</td></tr>
