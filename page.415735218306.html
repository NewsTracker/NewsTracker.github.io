<h3>Facebook opens Messenger app up to ESPN, J.J. Abrams [Photos]</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The upgraded Facebook Messenger app will add a wider range of video, voice and location-sharing capabilities, the company announced at its F8 developers' conference Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We think this service has the potential to let people express themselves in new ways," CEO Mark Zuckerberg said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Already, Facebook serves about 3 billion videos per day, he noted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mobile users click here for Fast Company's live coverage of the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The new Messenger app will support animated GIFs and will let users overlay special effects -- including a feature from J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot production company that will let people modify videos sent in messages to their friends, and a tool from JibJab Media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Among other partnerships, Facebook's Messenger will show users the best sports moments of the day from ESPN, said David Marcus, Facebook VP of messaging products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In addition, the new Facebook Messenger app will let users communicate directly with businesses, such as letting consumers track the status of their packages with shipping companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We're turning Messenger from a mobile-messaging app to a full-fledged conversational platform," Marcus said in an interview prior to F8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Messenger app will support media content across group conversations; so, that would enable, for example, a group karaoke experience, according to Marcus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Over all, Zuckerberg said in his opening remarks, Facebook's focus is on making the service more stable and secure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He cited steps the company has made to make the social service a safer destination for users and advertisers.</td></tr>
