<tr><td>6</td><td>Gray's death on April 19 reignited a public outcry over police treatment of African Americans that flared last year after the killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, New York City and elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A string of deadly confrontations between mostly white police and black men, and the violence it has prompted, will be among the challenges facing US attorney general Loretta Lynch, who was sworn in on Monday.</td></tr>
