<h3>Zinedine Zidane hints at Real Madrid bid for Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Zidane, who coaches Real's B team, said the Bernabeu giants were aware of the precocious Sterling and followed his progress as they would with any emerging talent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United have all been linked with Sterling since negotiations on a new deal were shelved until the summer after he rejected a 100,000-a-week deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We know who Raheem Sterling is, and of course we are monitoring him as a player," said Zidane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There are very few players in the world who can improve the Real Madrid squad, so it is going to make sense we monitor the progress of the best young players in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We monitor many of the best young players in Europe, then if we feel they have something to offer Real Madrid we will contact their club and try and make the next step."</td></tr>
