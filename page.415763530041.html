<h3>Germanwings: Andreas Lubitz breakdown six years ago offers clue</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Everyone who had encountered the 27-year-old, who grew up dreaming of becoming a pilot, described him as quiet, polite and "normal".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yet, in what Chancellor Angela Merkel described as a "new, simply incomprehensible" dimension to the Germanwings air disaster, it appeared that Lubitz was responsible for the deaths of 149 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A photo taken from Facebook shows Andreas Lubitz, co-pilot of the Germanwings Airbus A320 plane that crashed in the French Alps on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The only clue to what may have driven him to fly the Airbus A321 into an Alpine mountainside was an apparent breakdown he suffered six years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But, according to his employer, Lufthansa, he had fully overcome the depressive episode and was judged "100 per cent" fit to fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Lubitz enjoyed an affluent upbringing in the small town of Montabaur, 20 minutes drive from city of Koblenz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A person covered with a black blanket is led by police officers from the Lubitz family house in Montabaur on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His father was a successful business executive and his mother a piano teacher, and the family could well afford the cost of flying lessons at his local club, Luftorts Club Westerwald.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He first sat in the cockpit of a light aircraft at the age of 14 and, after a year of instruction under dual controls, was able to fly on his own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It was his dream to fly from an early age and it was a dream he began to fulfil here, so when he went on to gain his commercial licence and fly planes like the Airbus he was very happy and proud," said Klaus Radker, the club's chairman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Radker last saw Lubitz last autumn, when the Germanwings pilot returned to the club to renew his light aircraft flying licence and take part in the club's barbecue, which he attended with a girlfriend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The LSC Westerwald flight club on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>where the Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had been a member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Nobody at the club noticed anything strange in his demeanour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"He seemed normal; proud of his job after so much training. He seemed happy," said Mr Radker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I always found him a friendly, if very reserved, person. Open and polite".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He added: "I find it hard to believe that Andreas, who dreamt of flying and of being a pilot, would deliberately fly his plane into a mountain and kill all those people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>German police officers carry bags out of a house believed to belong to the parents of Andreas Lubitz on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"If that is true it also means that the results of all the psychological tests he would have had to take to be a pilot were wrong".</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It is believed that in 2009 Lubitz may have suffered some sort of breakdown that forced him to take a break from his pilot training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A mother of a school friend said Lubitz had told her daughter that he was suffering from depression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Apparently he had a burnout," the girl's mother told a German newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But she added that her daughter had seen him again just before Christmas and that he had appeared normal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Media gather in front of the house believed to belong to the parents of Lubitz on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Carsten Spohr, the chief executive of Lufthansa, Germanwings' parent company, said that Lubitz "took a break in his training six years ago. Then he did the tests [technical and psychological] again. And he was deemed 100 per cent fit to fly".</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But he added: "I am not able to state the reasons why he took the break for several months".</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Neighbours of Lubitz's parents in a suburb on the edge of Montabaur all spoke of a polite, if not particularly gregarious, young man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>German police in front of the house believed to belong to the parents of Lubitz on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Johannes Rossbach, 23, who lives two doors away, said he would regularly see the pilot jogging through the neighbourhood's quiet streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Mr Rossbach added: "He would always say hello and goodbye. There certainly seemed nothing out of the ordinary about him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"I didn't realise he was a pilot until I heard it yesterday. And today's news is absolutely shocking. I can't believe someone like that would kill 149 other people. It's something that absolutely needs investigating and proving before we can believe it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>German police carry boxes out of a house believed to belong to the parents of Lubitz on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Lubitz left Montabaur at the age of 20 in 2007 to begin his commercial pilot's training in the northern German city of Bremen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He was a year into his training when he appears to have suffered the breakdown and took a break, before returning to qualify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>By the time of the accident he was still relatively inexperienced, having notched up only 630 hours of flying time, compared to the flight captain, who had flown for more than 6,000 hours and had worked for Lufthansa for 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The Lubitz family's large detached home, set on a plateau on one of the hills surrounding Montabaur, was last night being treated as a crime scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Yesterday afternoon, groups of plain clothes police officers began carrying out a forensic search of the house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>They were also thought to be searching a flat Lubitz rented in Dusseldorf, 84 miles to the north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"We are conducting a search of the parents' home," Ralf Herrenbruck, the city's chief prosecutor, told the Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"All investigative measures are now under way".</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Lubitz was a keen runner and music fan, according to his Facebook page, which features a photograph of him by the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>In 2007, he came 72nd out of 780 participants in a 10km New Year run in Montabaur, racing alongside his then 54-year-old father, Gunter Lubitz, according to results posted by the organisers on its website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He also ran the Lufthansa Frankfurt half-marathon in 2013, 2012 and 2011 alongside his father, finishing in times varying from just under 1 hour 49 to 1 hour 37 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Peter Ruecker, a long-time member of Lubitz's flying club, said: "I'm just speechless. I don't have any explanation for this. Knowing Andreas, this is just inconceivable for me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Armin Pleiss, the head teacher of the Mons-Tabor-Gymnasium high school where Lubitz graduated in 2007, said: "I am just as shocked and surprised as you are".</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Laura, a neighbour whose brother was in the same year as Lubitz at the high school, added: "I didn't know him well, but to me he seemed very private, perhaps a little bit withdrawn. But who would have guessed at something so shocking happening?"</td></tr>
