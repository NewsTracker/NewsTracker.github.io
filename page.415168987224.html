<h3>Mourners pay respects to Russian opposition figure Boris Nemtsov</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nemtsov's body was laid out in a coffin in the Sakharov Centre - named after the late Soviet-era dissident and Nobel peace prize laureate, Andrei Sakharov - before being taken for burial at the Troyekurovskoy cemetery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Senior officials from Poland and Latvia who sought to attend the funeral said they had been denied entry to Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Polish foreign ministry said its Senate speaker, Bogdan Borusewicz, was refused entry by Moscow in reprisal for EU sanctions against Russia's upper house of parliament speaker, Valentina Matviyenko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Latvian MEP Sandra Kalniete told Agence France-Presse she had been refused entry at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport but was not given a reasonable explanation for the ban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Since I have always taken a clear and explicit language on Russia's role in Ukraine, I had suspicions that it could happen," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Martin Schulz, the European parliament president, called the bans a "high affront" that would further set back relations with Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said he would intervene with Russian authorities "in the strongest terms and demand an official explanation", adding that the Russian moves "are being applied without the slightest element of reasoning or any forewarning".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The queue of those waiting to pay their respects on an icy Moscow morning stretched for hundreds of metres along the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Inside the room, people were ushered past the open coffin as close friends and relatives stood vigil, including Nemtsov's mother, who turned 88 on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It was an attack on Boris Nemtsov, an attack on all of us, on Russian society, on the possibility for people to hold their own opinions," fellow opposition politician Gennady Gudkov said at the ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, had asked Russian authorities to release him from a 15-day jail sentence to attend the burial, but he was refused permission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>No high-ranking Russian politicians attended the ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Putin was represented by Garry Minkh, his representative in the Russian parliament, who passed on the president's condolences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Many of the speeches focused on Nemtsov's personal qualities but some could not avoid politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ilya Yashin, Nemtsov's long-time political colleague, said: "Putin has at least indirect responsibility for this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Also in attendance were the US ambassador, John Tefft, the former British prime minister John Major and the former Russian prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov, who has gone into opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>No suspects have been arrested in the death of Nemtsov, who was shot while walking with his girlfriend across a bridge near the Kremlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The incident has deeply shaken Russia's small and marginalised opposition movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Many supporters suspect that the killing was ordered by the Kremlin in retaliation for Nemtsov's criticism of Putin, while authorities have suggested several possible motives, including a provocation aimed at tarnishing the Russian president's image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Nemstov's Ukrainian girlfriend, Anna Duritskaya - the only known witness to his killing - reportedly flew to Kiev late on Monday after being held for questioning by authorities in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Yevgeny Perebiinis, Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesman, said the embassy in Russia had given Duritskaya "all the necessary assistance for her return to her home country", Interfax news agency reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Duritskaya, a 23-year-old model who said she had known Nemtsov for about three years, told the independent channel TV Rain on Monday that she was being held under police guard in a friend's apartment in Moscow and was not allowed to move around freely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>She said she had been questioned by the investigative committee for three days and had not been told why she was being held or for how long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I've told them everything possible, and I don't know why I am still on Russian territory, as I want to go back to my mum, who is ill and in a very difficult psychological state," Duritskaya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Nemtsov and Duritskaya had been walking across a bridge after dinner on Friday night when an unknown assassin shot the former deputy prime minister four times in the back, killing him on the spot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I don't want to answer questions about what happened on the bridge. I don't want to talk about this," Duritskaya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I am in a very difficult psychological condition and I cannot talk about this any more now. I feel bad I saw no one. I don't know where he came from, he was behind my back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Although numerous surveillance cameras are located in the area of the shooting, only inconclusive footage from a television channel's distant camera has been published.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In that video, a snow-removal lorry passes in front of what appears to be the couple at the exact time of the murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The federal protection service, which is in charge of guarding the Kremlin, said on Monday its cameras had not captured the killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But a blogger, Mitya Aleshkovsky, published a photograph he took of a Kremlin security camera shortly after the incident, which he said showed the camera was "pointed directly at the place of the murder".</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Duritskaya's lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov, said on Monday she would refuse to undergo a lie detector test because there was no reason to doubt her testimony, and it would put extra stress on her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The US president, Barack Obama, has said that the killing was a sign of a worsening climate in Russia, where civil rights and media freedoms have been rolled back in the past few years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"This is an indication of a climate at least inside of Russia in which civil society, independent journalists, people trying to communicate on the internet, have felt increasingly threatened, constrained. And increasingly the only information that the Russian public is able to get is through state-controlled media outlets," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"I have no idea at this point exactly what happened. What I do know is more broadly the fact that freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of information, basic civil rights and civil liberties inside of Russia are in much worse shape now than they were four or five, 10 years ago."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The news outlet Izvestiya, which has close ties to the authorities, reported early on Tuesday that the team investigating Nemtsov's killing "have focused on the explanation connected with the so-called Ukrainian trace".</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Investigators suspect that his murder was ordered by Ukrainian intelligence services or a pro-Kiev fighter named Adam Osmayev, an unnamed source reportedly said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Osmayev, a native of Russia's Chechnya republic who has recently reappeared fighting on the side of the government in eastern Ukraine, was charged in 2012 with a foiled attempt to assassinate Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>In a statement passed to the Guardian, Osmayev denied he had anything to do with the attack: "Boris Nemtsov was a hero for the Chechen people, as he once collected a million signatures against the first Chechen war. He was also a hero for the Ukrainian people, as he was one of the few voices against Russian aggression in Ukraine. Unfortunately, all the people who publicly criticise the regime in Russia tend to die at the hands of these low-lifes, but we believe they will face justice sooner or later."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Putin's spokesman said shortly after the killing that it was "100% a provocation", drawing criticism from some that the Kremlin could be sending signals about how it wants investigators to proceed.</td></tr>

<h3>Students face off against hundreds of Myanmar police on major road to Yangon</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hundreds of police have formed a human chain around student protesters staging a sit-in on a road Tuesday after being blocked from marching to Myanmar's biggest city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The demonstrators - who have been rallying for more than a month and gaining public sympathy - want the government to scrap a newly passed education law that they say curbs academic freedom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They were outnumbered by police in the town of Letpadan, but neither side appears willing to back down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Security forces formed rows around the students four layers deep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Myanmar started moving from a half-century of military rule toward democracy in 2011, but critics say the reforms that marked President Thein Sein's early days in office have either stalled or the government has been retreating on them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The education law, passed by parliament in September, puts all decisions about policy and curriculum in the hands of a body made up largely of government ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It bans students from forming unions and ignores calls for local languages to be used in instruction in ethnic states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Students say the law undermines the autonomy of universities, which are still struggling to recover after clampdowns on academic independence and freedom during years of dictatorship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Police have repeatedly warned they would "take action to restore law and order" if the protesters tried to bring their rally to Yangon - 140 kilometres (90 miles) south of Letpadan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Negotiations have been on again, off again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The threat of an expanded protest is sensitive in Myanmar, in part because students were at the forefront of pro-democracy protests in 1988 that were crushed by a bloody military crackdown.</td></tr>
