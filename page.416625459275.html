<h3>Fin24.com | Samsung regains smartphone lead over Apple</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The new Galaxy S6, right, and S6 Edge are displayed during a Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2015 event in Barcelona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Washington - Samsung retook the lead in the global smartphone market in the first quarter, as gains in emerging market sales helped it overtake Apple, a research group said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>IDC said Samsung sold 82.4 million smartphones in the first three months of the year, for a 24.5% market share.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Even though the number sold was down 7% from a year ago, it outpaced Apple, whose iPhone sales slipped slightly from the final quarter of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple held an 18.2% market share in early 2015 after selling 61.2 million iPhones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The figures were impacted by seasonal and other factors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Samsung notably launched its flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge phones at the end of the quarter in April, while Apple iPhone sales dipped compared with the stronger holiday quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the fourth quarter, Apple and Samsung were virtually tied with around 20% of the market each, according to several surveys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The challenge made by Apple for the top spot in the fourth quarter returned to a clear lead for Samsung in the first quarter, despite the soaring global demand for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus," said IDC analyst Anthony Scarsella.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Samsung's shipments, given that the S6 was not launched into the market for the full quarter, were driven by large volumes into emerging markets and steady demand for its midrange and lower-priced smartphones."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Chinese manufacturer Lenovo was third after completing its acquisition of Motorola from Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Its 5.6% market share placed it ahead of fellow Chinese group Huawei, with 5%, and South Korea's LG at 4.6%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>IDC said the overall global smartphone market grew 16.7% from a year earlier, with total shipments of 337 million units.</td></tr>
