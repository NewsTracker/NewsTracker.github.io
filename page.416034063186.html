<h3>John Oliver interviews&#239;&#191;&#189;Edward Snowden, and real journalism breaks out</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The interview, conducted in Russia,was something like a Frost/Nixon moment, proving the comedian can ask a hard-edged question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Oliver pushed hard against Snowden, whomhe described as "the most famous hero and/or traitor in recent American history."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The comedian asked Snowden if he had read every document he leaked and fired back when Snowden replied that he understands what he turned over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There's a difference between understanding what's in the documents and reading what's in the documents," Oliver said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He alsoconfronted Snowden about the New York Times publishing information heprovided that may have compromised an operation in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"That is a problem," Snowden acknowledged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"You have to own that, then," Oliver said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"You're giving documents with information you know could be harmful, which could get out there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Oliver eventually moved on to somewhat lighter fare, showingman-on-the street reactions by Americanswho don't know who Snowden is and reacting to the news that the NSA is able to collectsome of the naked selfiesAmericans send each other in a database.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>For his part, Oliver has said in the past that what he does is not journalism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We are making jokes about the news and sometimes we need to research things deeply to understand them, but it's always in service of a joke," he told the New York Times in November.</td></tr>
