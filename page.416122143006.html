<h3>Curry breaks 3-point record, Warriors beat Blazers 116-105 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Stephen Curry eclipsed his own NBA record for most 3-pointers in a season, scoring 45 points to rally the Golden State Warriors to a 116-105 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Curry entered the game four shy of his mark of 272 3-pointers, which he set two years ago in the season finale at Portland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He hit six before halftime and eight overall, teaming with fellow Splash Brothers star Klay Thompson to bring the Warriors back from 13 points down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Curry added 10 assists, and Thompson scored 26 to help Golden State avoid its first three-game losing streak this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Warriors (64-15), who have already secured home-court advantage throughout the playoffs because of a tiebreaker over East-leading Atlanta, clinched the NBA's best record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>LaMarcus Aldridge had 27 points and six rebounds, and Damian Lillard added 20 points and eight assists for the Blazers, who have already have locked up the Northwest Division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However, that doesn't guarantee they'll get home court in the first round - that's based on record - and Portland (51-28) fell two games behind the Los Angeles Clippers (53-26) in its chase for that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Curry shined the spotlight on his MVP credentials through the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He shot 17 of 23 from the floor, including 8 of 13 from 3-point range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He came through in the biggest moments, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Curry lost Lillard on the perimeter with a nifty behind-the-back dribble late in the fourth quarter, threw up a 3 and ran down court as if he knew it would go in - and it did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Curry added another jumper and converted a reverse layup between a pair of Portland scores to put the Warriors up 102-97 with more than 3 minutes to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Lillard and Aldridge kept bringing the Blazers back with an inside-out, two-man game that gave Golden State fits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Portland moved within a point before Golden State's All-Star duo put away the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Curry made three free throws, Thompson broke free for a layup and Curry delivered the dagger - crossing over Aldridge in the corner and hitting a step-back shot from 18 feet that gave Golden State a 111-103 lead with 1:11 left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Blazers never could keep up with Curry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>His shot started a big burst that lifted the Warriors ahead 57-54 at the half, with fans giving Curry a standing ovation as the Warriors recognized his milestone on the videoboards above center court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>At one point, Curry even glanced up at the screens to see what all the fuss was about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Trail Blazers: Aldridge had his 50th game with at least 20 points this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>... Portland lost all three games against the Warriors this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Warriors: Reserve guard Leandro Barbosa sat out with a sore Achilles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>... The Warriors matched the 1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers for the biggest improvement for a 50-win team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Each team won 13 more games than the previous year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>... Golden State has won 15 consecutive home games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Warriors are 36-2 at Oracle Arena this season, tying the franchise for home wins set by the defending champion Warriors in 1975-76.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Trail Blazers: Host Utah on Saturday.</td></tr>
