<tr><td>3</td><td>A video of the beating posted to the newspaper's website Sunday shows at least two police officers in riot gear hitting and kicking Giordano as the person filming screams, "He's a photographer! He's press!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Giordano, 41, said his head hit the ground during the beating, which he said only stopped when someone pulled him out of the fray.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>"(Gurbuz) was wearing his press credentials, was on a public sidewalk, and the events were happening in plain view," Reuters said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We hope that the department will dismiss the citation and, going forward, respect the First Amendment right of the press to lawfully take images in the public interest."</td></tr>
