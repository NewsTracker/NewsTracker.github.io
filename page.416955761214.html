<h3>Walker tweets out meeting with Netanyahu</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Thanks @netanyahu for the meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Aspiring Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker got his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but not much is known about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Wisconsin governor on Tuesday tweeted out a picture of him and Netanyahu, thanking him for the meeting and saying that "our democracies share common values & work to confront shared threats."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Walker's trip to Israel came amid friction between Netanyahu and President Obama over the Iran nuclear deal and other disputes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Walker has not been accompanied by reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's an educational trip," Walker said before departure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's not a photo op."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The Wisconsin governor, the current Republican front-runner in some early voting state polls, is in Israel until Thursday, but he isn't taking questions. Stung by his own past gaffes and those of other Republican presidential hopefuls abroad, Walker has locked the press out of his trip to the Jewish state, moving to burnish his foreign policy credentials without actually talking about foreign policy."</td></tr>
