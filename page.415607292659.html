<h3>Boehner off to Israel; Netanyahu's Ties to Obama Hit New Low</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>On the surface, the Republican leader's announcement Friday that he'll visit Israel looks like a jab at the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But a congressional aide insisted that Boehner's trip - during the two-week congressional recess that begins March 30 - was planned before new rifts developed over Netanyahu's address to Congress and the prime minister's remarks this week about the peace process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to publicly disclose details of the trip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>President Barack Obama bristled when Boehner invited Netanyahu to address U.S. lawmakers earlier this month about his fears that an emerging nuclear agreement would pave Iran's path to nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Relations took another hit Monday when Netanyahu made hard-line statements against the establishment of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Speaking on the eve of his re-election, Netanyahu said there could be no Palestinian state while regional violence and chaos persist - conditions that could rule out progress on the issue for many years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That ruffled the Obama administration, which views a two-state solution as a top foreign policy priority and had dispatched Secretary of State John Kerry for months of shuttle diplomacy in an effort to reach an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement that never materialized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Thursday, Netanyahu seemed to backtrack, saying in a TV interview that he remains committed to Palestinian statehood - if conditions in the region improve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Netanyahu told MSNBC that he hadn't changed his policy and that he remained committed to the two-state vision he spelled out in a landmark 2009 speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Obama called Netanyahu to congratulate him on his re-election, but also told the Israeli leader that the U.S. is reassessing its approach to Israeli-Palestinian peace in light of his comments about a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A White House official said Obama also raised Netanyahu's critical comments about Israeli Arabs ahead of the election, which the White House has denounced as a "cynical" effort to mobilize voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Asked whether Obama got a better understanding of Netanyahu's position on a Palestinian state after talking with him, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday: "That was not the result of the call."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Earnest said the administration has not decided what a reassessment in policy might mean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But he noted that in the past, the U.S. has regularly opposed U.N. resolutions to create a Palestinian state by arguing that such a two-state arrangement should be negotiated between the parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"What has now changed is that our ally in those conversations, Israel, has indicated that they are not committed to that approach anymore," Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Republicans have seized on the strained ties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On Capitol Hill on Thursday, Boehner, R-Ohio, mocked the administration's chilly reaction to Netanyahu's election victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Asked about Obama's lukewarm response, Boehner said, "Lukewarm?" and laughed heartily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who wrote a letter signed by 46 other GOP senators that warned Iran that any deal could be scrapped by Obama's successor, scolded administration officials for their handling of U.S.-Israel relations.</td></tr>
