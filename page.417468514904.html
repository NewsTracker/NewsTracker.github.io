<h3>Senate staff disputes ex-CIA official's defense of torture</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - The former deputy CIA director made a series of factual misstatements while defending the agency's harsh treatment of detainees in his recent book, Senate intelligence committee staffers assert in a 54-page document filed with citations from CIA records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The detailed critique of the memoir by Michael Morell shows the extent to which critics and backers continue to try to shape public perceptions of the CIA's post 9/11 detention and interrogation program, even months after the release of a Senate report that sought to render a final judgment on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>How the public interprets the CIA's use of torture is not merely a matter of history: At least one Republican presidential candidate, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, recently promised to bring back harsh interrogation techniques if elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Morell is affiliated with a consulting firm that includes former aides to Hillary Rodham Clinton, and he is often mentioned for possible national security jobs were she elected president in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Former CIA spokesman and co-author Bill Harlow has said that he and Morell stand by every word in the book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In December, the Senate intelligence committee released a 517-page summary of a 6,770-page classified investigation that was scathing in its criticism of the CIA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Based on millions of pages of CIA records, the report concluded that the CIA's brutal interrogations of al Qaida detainees after 9/11 were harsher than previously thought, and failed to produce the unique, life-saving, otherwise unobtainable intelligence by which they were justified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The report accused the CIA of consistently misrepresenting the program to Congress and to other agencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The report was the work of Democratic aides to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, then the chairman of the committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Some of those aides also wrote the critique of Morell's book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In last month's "The Great War of Our Time," Morell, who retired in 2013, defended the harsh interrogations and denounced the committee's report as "deeply flawed," and a disservice to the nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Morell argued that waterboarding, sleep deprivation and other brutal techniques used on al-Qaida detainees by the CIA produced crucially important intelligence, disputing the Senate report's conclusion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I am personally troubled by waterboarding," Morell wrote of the simulated drowning technique that has long been considered torture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But here is my moral dilemma...I believe that waterboarding was one of the two most effective of the all the harsh techniques (the other being sleep deprivation)."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the Senate document challenges Morell's command of the facts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It says that when he was in charge of the CIA's response to the study, he asserted in a meeting with Feinstein that "I'm not in the weeds" when challenged on specific details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It adds that he told Feinstein he had not read the full, classified report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>For example, Morell refers to Abu Zubaydeh, the first detainee who was waterboarded and brutalized, as a "senior al Qaeda figure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In his book, the Senate report argues, Morell conflated various terror plots attributed to al Qaida figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>For example, Morell wrote that 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was waterboarded and otherwise tortured by CIA interrogators, "was also planning to. send a team of Pakistanis to smuggle explosives into New York to target gas stations, railroad tracks, and bridges."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Senate report's fact-check responds: "Morell appears to be conflating several separate accounts," and it lays out various unconnected plots outlined in CIA records, some of which were dismissed by CIA analysts as wildly implausible.</td></tr>
