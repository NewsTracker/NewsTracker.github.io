<h3>Quick answers to double shooting elude police in Ferguson, Missouri</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>1 of 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A member of a St. Louis County investigative team speaks with a resident living in the neighborhood near the Ferguson Police Department, in Ferguson, Missouri March 12, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(Reuters) - Nearly 48 hours after two officers were shot in Ferguson, Missouri, investigators had dozens of leads but no arrests to report on Friday in the hunt for a gunman who turned a late-night protest against police into bedlam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said authorities had "a pretty good idea" where the gunshots that wounded the officers had originated, without providing specifics, but added that an arrest was not imminent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The kind of gun used, the shooter's motivation and any connection to the protesters remained a mystery, prolonging uncertainty for a town that has come to symbolize America's struggle with race and policing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The latest bout of violence in the St. Louis suburb, first rattled by the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a white officer last summer, brought out signs of sympathy for police on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>One protester stood opposite the Ferguson police department with a sign reading "Cops Lives Matter," playing on the "Black Lives Matter" slogan that sprang up in the wake of police killings of unarmed black men in New York City and elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Belmar said donations for rewards to help the investigation had poured in over the last two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The desire of some to move on from months of racial strife and protests played out in a chilly evening rain in front of the police department on Friday, where a dozen mostly white residents stood holding signs reading "I [heart] Ferguson".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Obviously we have a lot of changes to make, but we're very resilient and committed to do what's right," said Susan Ankenbrand, 72, a tour guide in St Louis and Ferguson resident for 40 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Though others, like The Organization for Black Struggle Executive Director Montague Simmons, are determined to continue the near-daily demonstrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Some people are sick of it, sure," Simmons said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"At the same time, others want us because of the change we bring."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>To that end, five residents signed an affidavit at Ferguson City Hall Friday afternoon to start a petition for Mayor James Knowles' recall, according to a statement from The Organization for Black Struggle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Residents will have 60 days to gather signatures from 15 percent of registered voters in the last mayoral election to prompt a special election, the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ferguson's police chief, city manager, municipal court judge and two police officers have resigned since the U.S. Justice Department released a damning review last week of the police force in Ferguson, where a majority of residents are African-American and most of the police are white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The report found that the force overwhelmingly arrested and issued traffic citations to black residents, creating a "toxic" environment with its policing practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But Knowles said on Friday that it would be up to voters to remove him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Somebody here has to be left standing to make sure the government continues to operate. There are ways to get rid of me as mayor," Knowles said in an interview with National Public Radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Knowles, whose job as mayor is part-time, told NPR, "I'm giving it every last measure at this point and I will continue to do so, as long as the citizens will have me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In Thursday's shooting, a 41-year-old county police officer suffered a shoulder wound and a 32-year-old colleague from a nearby police department sustained a facial wound that left a bullet lodged near his ear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Both were treated and released by a local hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The shooting of the officers came less than three months after the killing of two New York City patrolmen by a troubled man who said he was seeking to avenge the deaths at the hands of police of Brown and Eric Garner in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, who both have been critical of city leaders and police in Ferguson, called the assailants "criminals" and "punks" on Thursday.</td></tr>

<h3>Rescue effort begins in Vanuatu after powerful Pacific cyclone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A nine-member U.N. team was due to arrive on Sunday to carry out an initial assessment of the damage from the category 5 cyclone named Pam, which at its peak covered the entire country on satellite maps and brought houses crashing down with winds of more than 300 kilometers per hour (185 miles per hour).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Several other neighboring countries also were affected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Officials said the airport in Vanuatu's capital, Port Vila, remained closed, though they hoped it might partly reopen later on Sunday to allow in the first relief planes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As Cyclone Pam finally moved off to the southeast, more people left homeless by the disaster flooded into evacuation centers filled with thousands of evacuees, government officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Fears remained high that outlying islands, where there are few support services, may have been especially hard hit by flash flooding and cyclone-related damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Officials said they were still unable to contact any region outside the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Our communication link is still down," Paolo Malatu, an official at the country's National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We have not got any information from outside Port Vila."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The biggest need at the moment is shelter and food and wash kits," Malatu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With President Baldwin Lonsdale at a conference in Japan and unable to fly into Vanuatu, the government was being led temporarily by Charlot Salwai, acting minister for climate change, government officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Officials on Sunday confirmed six fatalities, a toll that is expected to increase amid unconfirmed reports of dozens of dead in the nation's remote northeast region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At least 20 others were injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We anticipate that (death toll) will go higher, particularly as information comes from the remote islands. We are talking about islands that are remote and really small, with none of what we would call modern infrastructure," said Colin Collett van Rooyen, Oxfam's country manager in Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He added that the government had declared a state of emergency for Shefa province, where Port Vila is located, adding that he anticipated it would eventually be extended to the entire nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Formerly known as the New Hebrides, Vanuatu is a collection of around 83 islands with a population of 260,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It experiences frequent earthquakes and storms, and aid officials regard it as one of the world's poorest nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Aid agencies in nearby Australia and New Zealand were preparing to send help.</td></tr>
