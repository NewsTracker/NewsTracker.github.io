<h3>Review: Little-known Facebook apps might remain just that</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - You probably already use Facebook on your phone, along with its Messenger app for chatting with Facebook friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>You might also have Instagram and WhatsApp, two services Facebook bought in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Not content with those successes, Facebook wants to be an even bigger part of your mobile life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>So far, its Creative Labs division has churned out seven little-known apps that extend existing Facebook features or try to compete with popular apps such as Snapchat - the difference being that Facebook's version hasn't been all that popular.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nonetheless, Facebook is unlikely to give up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>With Creative Labs, the 11-year-old tech behemoth is able to function more like a nimble startup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That means some apps might flop, but Facebook gets to embrace its now-retired catchphrase "move fast and break things."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Sure, every phone comes with the ability to make calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Now, you can do that through Facebook's Hello app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The idea is to give you more information about who's calling, such as the number of Facebook friends in common.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It also makes it easy to block unwanted calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If a number is blocked by a lot of people, the call will automatically go to your voicemail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>When you make the call, you're still going through regular channels - your normal phone app for cellular calls (which will eat up your minutes), or an app such as Messenger or TextNow for Wi-Fi and data calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Think of Hello as Facebook's overlay for your various calling apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The person you're calling doesn't need Hello, but won't get the additional information and blocking capabilities without it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>You can also search for local shops, bars or eateries and call the business through Hello.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>While this can be helpful, it's probably not enough to justify yet another app on your phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Whom it's for: People who use disposable phones and want to appear to those they are calling with a constant caller ID - as in their Facebook profile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Anyone with limited voice minutes who wants to screen unwanted calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Probably not you - especially if you have an iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Unlike the others, Hello is for Android only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Not wanting to fall behind Twitter when it comes to celebrities, Facebook designed Mentions with them in mind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The app lets bold-face names such as Oprah, Samuel L. Jackson and Jennifer Lopez connect with fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Regular folks like you can't download or use Mentions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But if you follow celebrities' Facebook pages, you can see their updates, photos, videos and public chat sessions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Celebrities can also use Mentions to post on Instagram and Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Whom it's for: Beyonce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>About half of Facebook's 1.44 billion members belong to one or more groups on the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Groups can be completely public, open by invitation only or "secret," such that they wouldn't even appear in a search unless you're already in the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>These groups let people connect based on a hobby, a genetic disorder, a geographic location or simply the love of a band.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Groups app brings together various group features so you don't have to dig around the main Facebook app on your phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>You can manage existing groups or find new ones, based on recommendations or searches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>You can also create shortcuts to your favorite groups on your phone's home screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>As with the main Facebook app, you can use Groups to discuss topics or plan events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Whom it's for: Highly organized, on-the-go individuals who want to easily keep tabs on the many Facebook groups they belong to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Your aspirational self.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Facebook was unsuccessful in buying Snapchat, the disappearing-message app popular with teenagers and millennials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Facebook's answer is Slingshot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Both are simple to use, but neither will work without other friends using it, so it helps if you're in with the hip young crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Slingshot is intended to make photo-sharing more reciprocal than simply throwing pictures up on Facebook or sending them over instant messaging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>When you get a photo from a friend, you can "react" by sending a response photo of your own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Photos here disappear, too, but only after 24 hours, rather than the few seconds that Snapchat gives you once you view it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>You can also swipe them away more quickly, as you would a dating rejection on Tinder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Whom it's for: Teenagers with selfie-sticks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Facebook employees.</td></tr>
