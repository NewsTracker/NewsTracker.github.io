<h3>Rangers head to NHL conference finals to face Lightning (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) -- It would seem there are two certainties ahead for the New York Rangers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>First, they will see some very familiar faces in the lineup of their opponent in the Eastern Conference finals: Tampa Bay's Brian Boyle, Anton Stralman and, if he recovers quickly enough from an appendectomy, former captain Ryan Callahan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Second, they will play lots of one-goal games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The series opens Saturday at Madison Square Garden, which former Lightning players Martin St. Louis, Dan Boyle and Dominic now call home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>New York has played 12 postseason games this spring and all were decided by the slimmest of margins, four in overtime, including Wednesday night's 2-1 victory in Game 7 against Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Rangers also had two one-goal outcomes at the end of the 2014 Stanley Cup finals loss to Los Angeles; the 14 straight is a record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''You have to be smart,'' captain Ryan McDonagh said after New York capped a comeback from a 3-1 hole in the series with Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''We talked about it ... to make sure shifts are short and you don't get overextended out there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It helps to have an all-world goalie like Henrik Lundqvist, who made 35 saves before Derek Stepan's goal eliminated the Capitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It helps to have no fear of overtime, in which the Rangers are 4-0 this spring, all by 2-1 scores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And it doesn't hurt to know you can handle the toughest situations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Rangers, who had the NHL's best record this season, are the only team to win a series after trailing 3-1 in successive years, doing the same thing to Pittsburgh in the second round in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>New York also has won six straight Game 7s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''We have a good group that keeps their wits about them and keeps calm,'' said Stepan, who was mobbed by his teammates along the glass as Madison Square Garden shook from the cheers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''There is no real panic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>We just go out and play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They haven't played Tampa Bay since December, and the Lightning swept all three meetings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Boyle, a center and penalty-killing fiend, and Stralman, one of the NHL's most underrated defensemen, joined Tampa Bay as free agents last offseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Callahan was dealt for St. Louis at the trading deadline last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Lundqvist was having few, if any, thoughts about his former teammates, and Steven Stamkos and Tyler Johnson, the Lightning's top scorers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''I am going to enjoy this tonight and maybe tomorrow; I don't even know when we start,'' said the third goalie with six Game 7 victories, joining Patrick Roy and Martin Brodeur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''It's a team that we obviously had some problems with during the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Lightning eliminated Montreal is six games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They finished five points behind New York in the overall standings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''I think our guys stay in the moment,'' said Alain Vigneault, a finalist for NHL Coach of the Year honors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''They stay in the present and focus on what needs to be done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Indeed, the Rangers weren't a dominant home team this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Lightning were, posting the league's best home mark at 32-8-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But New York had the best road record, 28-11-2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Home-ice advantage barely has existed in this postseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>So it's on to the final four for the Rangers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''You tell your players to focus on their job and what they need to do and you (as coaches) are doing the same thing,'' Vigneault said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''There was a lot of atmosphere, there was obviously a tense moment, but the guys just play.</td></tr>
