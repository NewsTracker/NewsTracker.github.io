<h3>Syrian air raids kill dozens of civilians in Islamic State-held town</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Syrian air force raid killed at least 59 civilians at a market in a town held by Islamic State militants in northern Syria on Saturday, according to a group monitoring the war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The strike on the town of al-Bab, north-east of the city of Aleppo, used "barrel bombs" - steel drums full of shrapnel and explosives, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has denied the air force uses such devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dozens of people were wounded in the attack, according to the monitoring group, which gathers information from sources on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A second Syrian air force raid in a rebel-held part of Aleppo city killed at least 12 civilians on Saturday, the Observatory said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>State news agency SANA did not report on these specific raids but, citing a military source, said the armed forces had targeted Islamic State in Aleppo province's eastern countryside and hit "terrorist organisations" on a road running north to the border, as well as to the south of Aleppo city and within the city itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The military has been hit by a series of recent setbacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Insurgents, including al-Qaeda's Syrian wing Nusra Front, celebrated inside the last government-held town in Idlib province on Friday after capturing it the night before, while Islamic State has secured its grip on the ancient city of Palmyra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In Syria's north-east, clashes erupted between pro-government forces and Islamic State to the south and south-east of Hasaka city, the Observatory said on Friday, after the al-Qaeda offshoot planted a bomb on the edge of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hasaka province is strategically important as it lies next to Islamic State-held territory in Iraq, where the group is back on the offensive after losing the city of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>SANA said the Syrian military had foiled an attack on Hasaka and that it had been targeting Islamic State in the countryside with the help of Kurdish YPG militia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The YPG, which has fought the fiercest battles against Islamic State in the north-east, says it does not co-ordinate with the Syrian military.</td></tr>
