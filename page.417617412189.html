<h3>IOC approves new events for 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC approved new events Monday in snowboarding, Alpine skiing, speedskating and curling for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Big Air in snowboarding, mass start in speedskating, mixed doubles in curling, and a team skiing event were the additions ratified Monday by the International Olympic Committee executive board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The snowboard parallel slalom event, meanwhile, was dropped from the Olympic program to make room for Big Air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Under IOC rules, events and disciplines can be added or removed up until three years before the games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The new events are for men and women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The IOC has been determined to attract younger audiences, as evidenced by the addition of halfpipe and slopestyle events at recent Winter Olympics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''The changes reflect the continued evolution of the Winter Olympic program and build on the success of recent editions of the games,'' the IOC said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The IOC recommends the participation of about 2,900 athletes competing in 100 events for the Winter Games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It looks like snowboard's Big Air will be the latest step in the goal to appeal to youth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In Big Air events, boarders fly off a highly pitched ramp similar to those on the slopestyle course, and perform jumps with multiple flips and spins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They do as many jumps as possible in an allotted amount of time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Big Air events in freestyle skiing had also been proposed for Olympic inclusion but did not win IOC approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The International Skating Union has also been looking to make Olympic speedskating more exciting for fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mass start races would add intrigue, team tactics and a direct confrontation of skating styles in a long-distance event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It could also bring some of the push and shove elements of short track to the Olympic big oval - something likely to displease purists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Curling has had two events, separate men's and women's competitions, since returning to the Olympics in 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>While traditional curling involves teams of four players, mixed doubles would include teams of two players - one male and one female.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Teams would have six stones each, instead of eight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The new Alpine skiing event involves teams of two men and two women competing in parallel slalom races.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The team event has been part of the world championships and the World Cup finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The IOC is also still working on the program for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Under a new procedure, Japanese organizers can propose the addition of one or more sports for their games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Baseball and softball - both out of the Olympics since the 2008 Beijing Games - are considered the favorites to be included in Tokyo because of their popularity in Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A final decision will be made in August 2016 on the eve of the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.</td></tr>
