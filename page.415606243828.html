<h3>Graham threatens to cut funds to UN if Obama bypasses Congress on Iran sanctions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Graham made the comments Thursday during an appearance on Fox News' "On the Record With Greta Van Susteren."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Graham, a Republican, is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In that role, he says he can block U.S. funding for the United Nations -- $654 million is earmarked for 2015 alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Twenty-two percent of the funding for the United Nations comes from the American taxpayers, and I'm in charge of that account," a defiant Graham told Fox News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He acknowledged he'd also need other lawmakers to sign onto any effort to suspend that funding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Graham is worried that the administration, should it strike a nuclear deal with Iran, might get the U.N. to lift sanctions without going through Congress to lift U.S. sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Graham, who says the worst possible outcome would be for Iran to get a nuclear weapon, vowed: "I'm not going to allow the United Nations to be used as a way to get around the United States Congress for a deal that affects the very existence of Israel and our own national security."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>When pushed on the issue, Graham said, "If they go to the U.N. Security Council, and the U.N. Security Council lifts all sanctions before we ever get a chance to look at this deal, absolutely I would suspend funding the United Nations, because I don't think your money should go to an organization that irresponsible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Graham strongly admonished the Obama administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They are about to make a mistake for the ages," Graham said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Earlier this month, Graham made a similar threat during a speech he gave at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At that event, he said he'd slash U.N. funds if the U.N. marginalized Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>International nuclear talks with Iran are expected to resume next week, following some disagreements -- reportedly over the sanctions issue -- on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Asked about the talks on Friday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said he did not want to speculate on what an actual deal might look like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But he said President Obama does not believe it makes sense to remove "a large number of sanctions at the front end of this agreement" -- as the Iranians reportedly want.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Earnest stressed the importance of existing congressional sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But he indicated the administration, should there be a deal, might be able to waive them down the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"One of the most powerful tools that we have in these negotiations are the congressional sanctions that Congress has passed, that those are some of the toughest sanctions that have ever been put in place against any country by the United States," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"And the president believes that we should leave those sanctions in place for -- not just for a few weeks to verify Iranian compliance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He added: "He believes that we should leave those sanctions in place over the longer term, and that the president can use the waiver authority that Congress has already given him, to relax some of those sanctions."</td></tr>

<h3>Israeli Arabs say they feel more excluded after election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The election, in which Netanyahu eventually secured his fourth term, highlighted the fraught relationship between Israel's Arab citizens and the Jewish state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Arabs voted in larger numbers than before and turned the main party representing them, the Joint List, into the third-largest in parliament, signaling they are more willing to work within the political system to seek equality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But some also said the campaign, which has polarized Israeli society, reflected an increasingly hostile atmosphere toward Arabs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I felt like someone stuck a knife in my heart because I am always pushing for equality between Arabs and Jews," Zuhair Bahloul, a veteran Arab sportscaster known for his pitch-perfect game commentary in Hebrew, said of Netanyahu's election day remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There is a bit of a feeling of despair because the prime minister is not the prime minister of all citizens, and the right is trying to push the Arabs aside," said Baloul, 64, who will enter parliament for the center-left Zionist Union, which failed to unseat Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In what was seen as an attempt to galvanize his hard-line supporters during Tuesday's election, Netanyahu had warned that "Arab voters are going in droves to the polls," with the help of "left-wing" activists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A posting on his Facebook page at midday during the balloting said the high turnout by Arab voters was putting right-wing rule "in danger."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Israeli leader has since said in interviews with U.S. media outlets that he had been misunderstood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He told NBC that he hadn't been trying to suppress Arab voting rights, but to "counter a foreign-funded effort to get the votes that are intended to topple my party."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Asked by NPR if he would engage in fence-mending, given how his remarks were received, Netanyahu said: "Well, I certainly will make sure that everybody understands that I'm the prime minister of all of Israel's citizens, and I really believe that. It's something that my actions have shown. It's not a question of fence-mending, it's a question of real belief, and it's there. I don't have to fabricate it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Earlier, White House spokesman Josh Earnest criticized the original comments as a "cynical election day tactic (that) was a pretty transparent effort to marginalize Arab Israeli votes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, told The Associated Press that anti-Arab rhetoric by Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman - who regularly accuses Arab politicians of representing terrorist groups - pose an "existential threat" to Arab citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Odeh said his party, which won 13 seats in the 120-member Knesset, will respond by fighting to improve the lives of 1.7 million Arabs, who account for just over 20 percent of Israel's population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He has said his party will work on shared issues with center-left Jewish opposition parties and seek membership in key parliamentary committees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Odeh and his allies may be in for a long slog in opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Netanyahu has signaled he will set up a government of right-wing and religious parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That's a potentially more stable coalition than his previous one, which was beset by ideological differences between centrists and ultra-nationalists and lasted less than two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Some analysts have described the 2015 election as a "tribal" vote reflecting the deep ethnic and religious divides even among Jews, despite the campaign's focus on economic issues, such as the high cost of living.</td></tr>
