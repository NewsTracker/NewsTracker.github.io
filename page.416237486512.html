<h3>Boehner says Obama request for authority to counter Islamic State stalled in Congress</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a meeting with a handful of reporters, the Republican leader said Obama's proposal for new authority is stalled months after Obama requested a three-year authority that bans "enduring offensive combat operations" for U.S. troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Boehner said it made no sense for Congress to give the president less authority than he already has to combat Islamic extremists, who have captured parts of Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Until the president gets serious, there's no reason to give him less authority," Boehner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Congress has held several hearings on Obama's request, issued in February, but the authority has languished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Boehner, who recently led a congressional delegation to the Middle East, said he wants U.S. forces in Iraq to have a larger role in planning and directing Iraqis trying to combat the Islamic militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He stopped short of saying the U.S. should send more than the 4,500 troops in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Boehner expressed frustration with the administration's strategy, saying he repeatedly heard two questions from U.S. allies - where's America headed or is America abandoning us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He echoed the administration contention that Syrian President Bashar Assad has to go after years of civil war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Boehner maintained that Islamic State militants are a more serious concern than Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"His power base continues to shrink," Boehner said.</td></tr>
