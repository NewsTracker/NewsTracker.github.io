<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) - Guinea has closed its border with Sierra Leone as part of new efforts to stamp out Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cmdr.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mamadou Alpha Barry, spokesman for the national gendarmerie, said the border was closed starting Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>President Alpha Conde announced this weekend that emergency measures would be "reinforced" for a 45-day period in five districts, including some along the border with Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Previously, Guinean authorities had monitored people crossing into the country for symptoms of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Guinea is now ramping up efforts to eliminate Ebola, which is stubbornly entrenched in the country more than a year after the outbreak started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>By contrast, Liberia currently has no Ebola patients, and Sierra Leone has seen a fairly steady decline in cases.</td></tr>
