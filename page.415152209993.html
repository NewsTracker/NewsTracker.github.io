<tr><td>4</td><td>Lee Tien, senior staff attorney and Adams Chair for Internet Rights at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the Daily Mail Online 'insiders are frequently part of the breach story'.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>An internal investigation within the department found she went into the database 24 times between 2006 and 2009 to retrieve the information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Just 24 hours after searching through the database on one occasion in 2009, the documents revealed she applied for a personal loan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The unidentified employee was arrested and charged in 2011 for stealing more than $500 using the stolen details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>After pleading guilty, she was sentenced to 18 months in jail with a 17-month suspended sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>However, according to the documents, the employee only served a month in prison and was then given authorized work by a judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It's not known what happened to the other staff members involved in the scheme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In 2011, a man violated department protocols by trying to access 'Barrack [sic] Obama's student loans records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>According to the documents he consistently spelled the president's name wrong - using two 'r's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The employee involved was not prosecuted, but lost his job after departmental staff also discovered he had misused his government-issued travel card.</td></tr>

<tr><td>28</td><td>A third Department of Education employee was investigated in 2014 for using his government email to promote his own business at the taxpayers' expense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Some of the documents involved have been heavily redacted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The analysis revealed there were approximately 166 calls totaling 616 minutes or approximately 10 hours of calls during on-duty hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>His calls cost the government approximately $478.36 based on his hourly salary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He admitted that he shouldn't have used government equipment - including a scanner, printer, phone and email - for his own personal gain, but it's not clear what type of business he was operating or whether he was punished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Another part of the document trove described the investigation into Joseph Butler, a veteran department employee from Clarkstown, Georgia, who accessed child pornography for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>According to reports he was able to filter his computer activity and get around filtering software preventing government staff from visiting illicit websites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>More than 70 disturbing images were founded embedded in several Microsoft Word documents that were then saved to his government computer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>His Internet browsing history also revealed he had searched for child nudity and pornography.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Butler used his computer to download images onto CD-ROMs, which federal agents found during a search of his home in July 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Agents also found graphic stories Butler had written about children.</td></tr>
