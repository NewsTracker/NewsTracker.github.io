<h3>Prince releases Freddie Gray protest song ?Baltimore?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prince released his much-anticipated protest song about "Baltimore" on Saturday - one day before his scheduled "Rally 4 Peace" concert in the troubled city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Contrasting lyrics inspired by the death of Freddie Gray and the subsequent riots in Baltimore, Prince's like-named song has the light, pop-rock panache of hits like "Raspberry Beret."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's catchy - in this case, to a fault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Listeners may have trouble putting together its sober lyrics with the sometimes flighty tune, enlivened by several rousing guitar solos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Nobody got in nobody's way / So I guess you could say it was a good day / at least a little better than the day in Baltimore," Prince sings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Does anybody hear us pray? / for Michael Brown or Freddie Gray / Peace is more than the absence of war," reads part of the second verse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Later, the song includes the repeated refrain, "If there ain't no justice / then there ain't no peace."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prince recorded the song on April 30 at his Paisley Park Studios, playing every instrument himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In an interview with My Fox Twin Cities, Prince explained that the Freddie Gray incident - along with recent health issues for the star's idol Joni Mitchell - inspired his piece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"With everything going on ... I had a lot to get out," Prince said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>His "Rally 4 Peace" benefit show will take place Sunday night at Baltimore's Royal Farms Arena.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The audio portion will stream in its entirely on Jay Z's new Tidal service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Proceeds from the show will benefit various Baltimore youth charities.</td></tr>
