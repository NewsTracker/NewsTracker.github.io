<h3>Boris Nemtsov's shaken girlfriend says she didn't see killer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Speaking largely without emotion in deadened monosyllables, Ukrainian fashion model Anna Duritskaya said she had little recollection of what happened in the moments after Nemtsov was shot dead on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She told online news channel Dozhd that she had not noticed anything suspicious as the couple dined at a restaurant overlooking Red Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It had not occurred to her that someone might be following them as they headed across the river towards Nemtsov's apartment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I don't want to answer questions about what happened on the bridge. I don't want to talk about this," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I am in a very difficult psychological condition and I cannot talk about this any more now. I feel bad ... I saw no one. I don't know where he came from, he was behind my back," she said of the killer or killers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nemtsov, 55, was shot several times and killed instantly, becoming the most prominent opposition figure to be murdered during President Vladimir Putin's 15-year rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tens of thousands of Russians marched through Moscow on Sunday to honour the former deputy prime minister and anti-corruption fighter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Duritskaya, who is 23 or 24, said she had been under constant guard since the murder and would probably be unable to attend Nemtsov's funeral on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>All she wanted to do was to go home to her mother in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I have every right to leave the territory of the Russian Federation. I am not a suspect. I am a witness who gave full testimony and did everything possible to assist the investigation," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"They are physically not allowing me to go anywhere without them," Duritskaya said, referring to law enforcement officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"They have explained to me that this is for security reasons."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nemtsov, an opposition politician whose murder has deepened a divide between liberals and Putin supporters, will be buried on Tuesday at the Troekurovskoye cemetery in western Moscow, far from where Russia's top politicians are usually buried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I cannot go out. Most likely I will not go," Duritskaya said when asked if she would attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She said she was now staying at a friend's apartment in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Investigators had questioned her several times, gone through her belongings and taken data from her mobile phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She said she was initially questioned for several hours without a lawyer or representative from the Ukrainian embassy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Nemtsov had criticised Putin's annexation of Crimea and his support for pro-Russian separatists in the east of Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He and Duritskaya had been dating for three years, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The investigators say they are following several lines of inquiry and have come up with a number of possible motives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>One is that Nemtsov may have been the victim of a jealous former lover, a version Duritskaya ruled out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I don't think anything. I cannot think at the moment. I don't know who did it," she said.</td></tr>

<h3>Happy birthday goon! As the classic Aussie invention of the cask wine turns 50 - the top 10 best boxes on offer are revealed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Many of us associate drinking from a shiny silver bladder as our cheap and nasty introduction to wine in our clueless youth - however casks have come a long way in the past half of a century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>So much so that in 2015, one in every three glasses of wine drunk in Australia actually comes out of a cask.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A stark contrast to back in 1973 when the cask hadn't taken off yet and drinking wine was only consumed on special occasions - hence each Aussie only drank about 9.8 litres of wine per year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This figure jumped to 19.3 litres per capita consumption over the next decade as people really got into the boxed varietal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Wine W*****s blog decided to test 10 of Australia's most premium cask wine in the most stereotypically ocker way possible - hanging the bags from yet another fair-dinkum Aussie invention - the Hills Hoist clothes line - otherwise known as the Goon of Fortune game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Drew Lambert, a member of the popular wine blog, taste-tested all casks that were taken out of their boxes, numbered and then pegged to the clothes line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Drew encourages wine lovers to check out the variety of cask wines that is now on offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'If you haven't ventured into the cask section of your local bottle shop lately, you're in for a treat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'Cask producers have responded to the trend of consumers drinking less wine, but drinking better quality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But enough about educational side of things - let's find out what Drew's taste buds believe are the top of the line in the cask wine world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'A sensational wine with amazing balance and delicious cabernet fruit flavour of casis and oak.</td></tr>
