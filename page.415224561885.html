<h3>Facebook rant lands man in UAE jail</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Helicopter mechanic Ryan Pate wrote the Facebook post while in Florida after arguing with employer Global Aerospace Logistics (Gal) over sick leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On returning to Abu Dhabi from Florida, he was arrested for breaking the country's strict cyber-slander laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>His trial is due to start on 17 March and he could face up to five years in jail and a large fine if found guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Pate's dispute with his employer began in December last year when he sought to extend his holiday to see a doctor about a long-standing back injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After being told he could not extend his leave, Mr Pate posted a rant about the Abu Dhabi-based firm on his Facebook page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the post, Mr Pate called Gal "backstabbers" and warned other contractors about working for the firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He also complained about life in the UAE and used a racial slur against the region's people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He returned to Abu Dhabi in order to resign but soon after arriving he was called by police who told him to report to a nearby police station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On attending he was shown screenshots of the Facebook message and told his employer had filed charges accusing him of breaking wide-ranging Emirates laws that ban slander.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The laws were introduced in late 2012 and make it an offence to use the net to mock or deride organisations and individuals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This is the latest in a series of difficult cases for UAE authorities following the introduction of the country's 2012 Cyber-crimes law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>One involved the detention of a man who had filmed and uploaded a video of an Emirati government official attacking an Indian van driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The attacker faced a fine of up to 10,000 dirhams ( 1,800) and a year in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The uploader, charged with defamation for sharing a video of the attack, faced a possible penalty of two years in jail, and a 20,000 dirhams ( 3,600) fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>And whilst in this case many in the west may be surprised to see that someone could face imprisonment for what might be regarded as innocuous comments on Facebook about an employer, in Gulf culture, protection of reputation is seen as paramount, and enshrined by tough laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Now it has garnered international attention though, this new case poses yet another potentially embarrassing headache for the UAE government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>However, the resolution of the road rage incident may offer a model.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>All charges were dropped, whilst the attacker lost his job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Although Mr Pate will no doubt hope that he avoids the fate of another American who was caught up in the UAE's cyber-crimes law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Shezanne Cassim was convicted and spent a year in jail for uploading a satirical video to YouTube.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I never even entertained the fact that I would wind up in prison out here for something I put on Facebook in the United States," said Mr Pate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Gal has yet to respond to requests for comment about the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>However, news about Mr Pate's arrest has begun to spread online and some people have posted comments on Gal's Facebook page criticising the way it has treated him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In addition, Mr Pate's cause has been taken up by his congressman David Jolly who has contacted the US State Department and the UAE attorney general seeking to get the case quashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"It is deeply troubling that Mr Pate now faces judicial proceedings over an action that was done legally in his home country," said Mr Jolly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mr Jolly is also pushing for a meeting with the US ambassador to the UAE to get help with the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mr Pate's fiancee has begun an online effort to raise funds to pay his legal fees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The US State Department said the American embassy in the country has helped Mr Pate get medical attention and legal advice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Mr Pate was arrested on 16 February and spent about 10 days in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He has now been released on bail prior to the trial later this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"I just want to apologise to everybody I dragged into this," Mr Pate said in an interview with a US newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"It is embarrassing, and I never meant for this to happen. I let my emotions get the better of me."</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) - Liberia released its last Ebola patient, a 58-year old teacher, from a treatment center on Thursday, beginning its countdown to being declared Ebola free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I am one of the happiest human beings today on earth because it was not easy going through this situation and coming out alive," Beatrice Yardolo told The Associated Press after her release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As she walked out of the clinic, wearing a bright yellow shirt, hospital cap and a beaming smile, Yardolo kept thanking God and the health workers at the center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Yardolo said she had been admitted to the Chinese-run Ebola treatment center in the Paynesville district of Monrovia on Feb. 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A mother of five, she is originally from the northeastern county of Nimba near the borders with Guinea and Ivory Coast, but lives in Monrovia where she teaches English at a church-run school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The St. Paul's Bridge community where she resides and works had become the last "hotspot" for Ebola cases in Monrovia, according to Tolbert Nyenswah, Assistant Health Minister and head of the country's Ebola response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Yardolo's release brings Liberia hope after about a year of battling the deadly Ebola virus, which killed more than 4,100 people in this West African country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There are no other confirmed cases of Ebola in the country, and as such Liberia can begin to count up to 42 days to be declared Ebola free in keeping with World Health Organization protocols and standards, Nyenswah said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He challenged all Liberians to commit themselves to achieving "zero Ebola infections" by rigidly abiding by the anti-Ebola regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has said no country can be declared Ebola free until all the other countries have no cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea have been hardest hit in the yearlong Ebola outbreak, which is estimated to have left more than 9,800 people dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This is an encouraging sign for Liberia. However, there is no room for complacency as the number of new Ebola cases in the region has risen this week," said Vickie Hawkins, director of Medecins Sans Frontieres UK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"People move easily over the porous borders that separate Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, so until 42 days pass without a new case in any of the three worst affected countries we need to remain vigilant."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The WHO on Wednesday reported 132 new Ebola cases last week, an increase from the 99 cases reported the previous week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The agency said the spread of Ebola remains "widespread" in Sierra Leone and noted that cases have jumped both there and in Guinea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Nine new cases were reported in a 24-hour period, according to an update from the Sierra Leone government on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"There is always the risk of re-infection. We're still seeing a lot of suspected and probable cases in Liberia," said Sebastian Funk, an Ebola expert at London's School of Hygiene and Tropical Medecine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Ebola was first introduced to Liberia from Guinea and I see no reason why that wouldn't happen again if it is still circulating in Guinea."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Funk said that continued resistance to aid efforts in Guinea could be driving the spread there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>According to WHO data, both Guinea and Sierra Leone have recorded more than a dozen unsafe burials in the past several weeks, while Liberia hasn't reported any unsafe burials since mid-February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Unsafe burials, where friends and family members are in close contact with the body of an Ebola victim, have often sparked explosive spread of the disease during the outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Liberia has also successfully traced all known contacts of Ebola cases, compared with just 49 percent for Guinea and 78 percent for Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Not being able to trace potential cases means health officials in Guinea and Sierra Leone don't know where many new cases are coming from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Resistance to Ebola containment efforts also continues to be a problem in Guinea and Sierra Leone, which have both reported numerous "security incidents" or other forms of refusal to cooperate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Since late February, Liberia has only reported just one such event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The U.N. health agency said Thursday it will start large-scale testing of an experimental Ebola vaccine in Guinea on Saturday to see how effective it might be in preventing future outbreaks of the deadly virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The health agency's vaccination strategy in Guinea aims to create a buffer zone around an Ebola case to prevent its further spread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Officials will vaccinate people who have already been exposed to Ebola cases and are at risk of developing the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The vaccine being tested - VSV-EBOV - was developed by Canada and is now licensed to Merck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>A second vaccine - one developed by U.S. National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline - will be tested in a separate study as supplies become available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Associated Press Medical Writer Maria Cheng in London contributed to this report.</td></tr>
