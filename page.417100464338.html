<h3>Greek bailout deal could be reached 'within the next week'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said on Monday that he expects an agreement with bailout creditors within the next week, which would save the cash-strapped country from fast-approaching bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I think we are very close," Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Let's say (it's a matter) of about a week."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Earlier, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said the country has tabled detailed proposals for a viable deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But he warned that Greece is in a state of "financial strangulation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Over the past few weeks, Greece has survived by scraping together cash from reserve accounts to pay debts as well as day-to-day commitments like wages and pensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However, Athens admits it is running out of options as further debt repayments come due next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If no deal is agreed, Mr Tsipras' government may be faced with a choice of what to pay, imposing capital controls or even leaving the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I assure you that if we face a dilemma between paying a creditor who refuses to sign an agreement with us and a pensioner, we will pay the pensioner," Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I hope we will be able to pay both."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Tsipras also faulted Greece's creditors for the liquidity crunch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The lack of liquidity is neither the choice nor the responsibility of the Greek government," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It is a tough negotiating tactic of our partners, and I do not know whether everybody in Europe feels proud of it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis said that to honor its debt obligations this summer, Greece needs more financial assistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>As a result, Mr Sakellaridis expects a deal with creditors "by the end of May."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Markets appear to be uncertain about how the latest episode in the Greek debt crisis will pan out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Though uncertainty over Greece caused the interest rate on the government's two-year bonds - a gauge of default risk - surge about 3 percentage points on Monday to above 24 per cent, the Athens Stock Exchange closed 1.6 per cent higher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In the talks, Athens is proposing reform measures that might protect Greeks hammered by a six-year recession, but lenders say the proposals are too vague.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr Varoufakis said the main sticking points include demanded pension and labour reforms, as well as the height of the primary budget surplus - which excludes the cost of servicing Greece's huge debt - in coming years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Government officials have suggested that Athens could seek popular approval for the final deal, through elections or a referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But Mr Varoufakis said he didn't expect either, and the agreement would be ratified in parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He said it would be "foolish" to hold elections just months after the government came to power, adding that any referendum would effectively be a vote on whether to keep or lose the euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"And it would be unfair for Greek citizens to have to take a position on such a matter, answering with either a yes or a no," Mr Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Athens has already pooled cash reserves from schools, hospitals and local government to fund the state's debt payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>And Mr Sakellaridis confirmed the government this month used a reserve account with money in a currency unit used by the IMF to repay a loan to the Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mr Sakellaridis also insisted Greece would not accept a one-off bank deposit levy to resolve the cash crisis - a similar measure had been used in eurozone member Cyprus two years ago.</td></tr>
