<h3>Hillary Clinton's standing falls among Democrats: poll</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Clinton's standing is falling among Democrats, and voters view her as less decisive and inspiring than when she launched her presidential campaign just three months ago, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The survey offers a series of warning signs for the leading Democratic candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Most troubling, perhaps, for her prospects are questions about her compassion for average Americans, a quality that fueled President Barack Obama's two White House victories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Just 39 percent of all Americans have a favorable view of Clinton, compared to nearly half who say they have a negative opinion of her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That's an eight-point increase in her unfavorable rating from an AP-GfK poll conducted at the end of April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The drop in Clinton's numbers extends into the Democratic Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Seven in 10 Democrats gave Clinton positive marks, an 11-point drop from the April survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nearly a quarter of Democrats now say they see Clinton in an unfavorable light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>``I used to like her, but I don't trust her,'' said Donald Walters of Louisville, Kentucky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>``Ever since she's announced her candidacy for the presidency I just haven't liked the way she's handled things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While Clinton's approval rating fell, Obama's stayed constant at 46 percent since April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>More than 8 in 10 Democrats have a positive view of the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At least part of Clinton's decline may be due to questions about her character, a topic Republicans have been trying to make central to the 2016 campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In ads, stump speeches and online videos, they paint her as a creature of Washington who flouts the rules to get ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>While Clinton has spent decades in the public eye, she's focused in recent months on creating a more relatable _ and empathetic _ image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In public events, she frequently talks about her new granddaughter, Charlotte, and references her early career as a legal advocate for impoverished children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The survey suggests that voters aren't sold on her reinvention: Only 4 in 10 voters say they view Clinton as ``compassionate.'' Just 3 in 10 said the word ``honest'' described her either very or somewhat well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Stephanie Bergholdo, a Democratic voter from Oak Park, California, says she finds Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren far more sincere in their liberal views _ though she's likely to vote for Clinton should she become the party's nominee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>``She's piggybacking on some of the things they've been talking about,'' said Bergholdo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>``I don't think she comes across very genuine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The percentage of respondents calling Clinton at least somewhat inspiring also slipped from 44 percent to 37 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Even the number of voters saying Clinton is at least somewhat decisive, previously a strong point for the former New York senator, fell from 56 percent in April to 47 percent in the new poll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>``She's pretty much a run-of-the-mill Democrat,'' said Mark Oldenburg of Madison, Wisconsin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Other polls released this week show contrasting results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A Washington Post-ABC News survey found an uptick in Clinton's favorability, while a Suffolk University-USA Today poll showed a slightly net negative rating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>That means the downturn for Clinton could be a result of random differences in survey sampling or a troubling trend for the dominant Democratic candidate, underscoring the undefined nature of the crowded early presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Democrats argue that a drop in her numbers is a predictable result of Clinton's return to the partisan fray after years in the less overtly political position of secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Republicans, meanwhile, attribute the drop to questions about the financial dealings of Clinton's family foundation and her use of an email account run from a server kept at her New York home while serving as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Clinton's bad marks weren't unique: Nearly all of the Republican candidates surveyed in the poll shared her underwater approval ratings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a leading GOP candidate, saw his unfavorable ratings rise to 44 percent from 36 percent in April.</td></tr>
