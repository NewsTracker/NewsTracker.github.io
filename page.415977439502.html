<h3>Kenya: Survivor found in school attack which killed 148</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, told The Associated Press from her hospital gurney that she hid in a large cupboard and covered herself with clothes, refusing to emerge even when some of her classmates came out of hiding at the demands of the gunmen from the al-Shabab group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She was rescued shortly before 10 a.m., according to Kenyan officials.</td></tr>
