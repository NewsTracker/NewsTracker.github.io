<h3>Vintage 'alien' photos that governments couldn't explain revealed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Now one team of 'alien hunters' has dug up some of the best images to see if the public can shed light on the eerie glows, mysterious orbs and flying objects from the last few decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Among them is a remarkable 1957 photo taken by a test pilot near Edwards Air Force Base in California, allegedly showing a UFO following a B-47 jet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Another, released by the Aerial Phenomena Group, shows three mysterious lights over the Manhattan skyline taken in 1984.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was taken by Philipe Orego from New Jersey, and researchers could find no sign of a hoax at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'The basic problem is that if a UFO photograph is taken in daylight and looks close, clear and sharp, you suspect it is a fake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Watson said that a good case to illustrate this point is the image of the UFO over Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In February 1942, fears of a Japanese air raid and invasion struck LA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On 23 February, a Japanese submarine allegedly shelled the Elwood Oil Field near Goleto, north of Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the early hours of 25 February, a fleet of mystery aircraft were seen heading for the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall reported in a memorandum to President Roosevelt dated 26 February 1942 that as many as 15 airplanes may have been involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Although 1430 rounds were expended by the 37th Coast Artillery Brigade's anti-aircraft guns no aircraft was hit or shot down and no bombs were dropped by the aircraft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The only conclusion was that commercial aircraft were used by enemy agents to determine the location of anti-aircraft guns and to spread alarm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'This invasion scare became the subject of Steven Spielberg's high-rolling comedy movie '1941' (1979) that shows how fear ensnares people in a web of obsession and conflict fuelled by rumours and the media,' said Watson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An analysis by UFO expert Dr Bruce Maccabee suggests that the object caught by the searchlight beams was 100 feet wide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Steven Lacey, another UFO believer, using Photoshop cleared up the image to reveal an image of a classic flying saucer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'In contrast, aviation historian Brett Holman puts forward a convincing case that the searchlights are converging on a small cloud rather than a UFO or extra-terrestrial battlecruiser,' said Watson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>'And, he has found other examples of antiaircraft searchlights illuminating clouds that look like flying saucers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A number of 'closed' cases were also recently revealed by the US government who opened its files into 12,000 encounters with UFOs spanning between 1947-1969.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Microfilms of these cases, collectively known as Project Blue Book, have become available for anyone to view online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>One of the most famous is the Lubbock Lights incident, which was reported on August 30, 1951 in Texas by three professors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The witnesses were sitting in the backyard of one of the professor's homes when they saw 20 to 30 'lights' fly overhead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>One of the professors said the objects 'appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate and they were greenish-blue, slightly fluorescent in colour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The USAF concluded that these lights were most likely caused by birds named plovers, which have white breasts that can reflect lights from cities below.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Another image, titled simply 'Winter 1951', shows what the photographer believed to be a flying saucer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>However, scientists discovered that the eerie shape was a lenticular cloud which are created by moist air that has condensed at a high altitude.</td></tr>

<h3>Execution as spectacle: why the Bali nine duo were treated like the world's most dangerous men</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hundreds of masked and heavily armed security personnel took Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, reformed and compliant prisoners by all accounts, to Nusakambangan prison complex on Wednesday, shadowed by Sukhoi fighter jets equipped with missiles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Meanwhile, on the same day, another drug smuggler was transported in a small van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The bizarre and degrading spectacle is part of a trend, not just in the executions of drug felons, but of the presidency of Joko Widodo, widely known as Jokowi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lauded upon his election as a progressive force from outside Indonesia's graft-ridden elites, Jokowi as president has emerged as a leader much more like the man he defeated, former military hardman and ultra-nationalist Prabowo Subianto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jokowi is sincere about grappling with the drugs problem in Indonesia, even if he has a poor understanding of the dimensions and cause of the "national crisis".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But, from the outset, he has used the kind of anti-foreign theatrics popular with Indonesia's first leader Sukarno, who was the father of Jokowi's political patron Megawati Soekarnoputri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While Sukarno used nationalist rhetoric to distract the population from a collapsing economy, Jokowi has engaged in the same tactics at a time when his personal popularity has been on the slide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Andrew Chan is transferred from Bali for execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jokowi has mishandled the issue that concerns Indonesians most - the rampant corruption in its police force, judiciary and other national institutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As the police have threatened to arrest members of the respected Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), Jokowi has put forward two candidates for police chief identified as having "suspicious bank accounts".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As the scandal engulfed him, Jokowi called in the navy to blow up captured illegal fishing boats before invited television crews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Soon after, Jokowi announced he would rapidly accelerate executions as he declared a drugs emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The awful irony is that eradicating corruption in the police and judiciary would be a far more effective tool in combating drug trafficking than killing low level couriers and organisers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The kingpins invariably get off in Indonesia by paying large bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It is instructive that almost half of the 64 drug felons on death row are Indonesians but, of the six killed so far and 10 slated to face the firing squad in the near future, 14 are foreigners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Australian government is not entirely blameless in all this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It, too, has fomented hostile sentiment in Indonesia, not least Tony Abbott's remarks tying tsunami aid to clemency for Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Australia has also burned the fishing boats of Indonesians who have strayed into Australian waters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Then there were the incursions by Australian navy vessels into Indonesian waters to "turn back the boats" laden with asylum seekers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Both policies have angered Indonesians, and ripened the climate for Jokowi to exploit nationalist sentiment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That will happen when nine men and one woman - including Chan and Sukumaran - will be lined up in a clearing in the jungles of Nusakambangan and shot dead simultaneously by 120 police officers.</td></tr>
