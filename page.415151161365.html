<h3>Toronto Police Find Mystery Tunnellers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Police digging into the mystery of a tunnel found near a Toronto sports centre have said the builders posed no threat to the city but have refused to reveal its purpose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 10-metre-long tunnel was discovered by a conservation officer in a secluded forest near York University on 14 January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It contained plywood wall supports, a gas generator, moisture-resistant light bulbs, a sump pump to remove groundwater and food and drink containers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Police also found rosary beads with a Remembrance Day poppy nailed to a wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The tunnel lay 10 feet below the ground, was over six feet high and three feet wide, and police believe it was dug entirely by hand using a pulley system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Describing it as "warm and comfortable inside", Deputy Police Chief Mark Saunders said he believed the tunnel was only for use in winter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This was built with a considerable amount of sophistication," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The tunnel was just metres from the fence of a complex due to host the Canadian Open tennis tournament and various parts of the Pan-American Games in the summer, prompting police fears that the tunnel diggers could have terrorism on their minds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But now police have identified the two men who built the tunnel and are satisfied there is no threat to the public or criminal intent involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In a statement, police did not identify the men or give any clues to why they had built the tunnel, apart from describing the motive as "personal reasons".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Toronto police spokesman Mark Pugash said: "Our concern was whether there was any criminal intent or threat to the people or the city. There was not.</td></tr>

<h3>Ukraine's military says one Ukrainian serviceman killed in past 24 hours</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A local resident walks as a military truck from the Ukrainian armed forces transports a self-propelled howitzer on the road near Artemivsk, eastern Ukraine, March 2, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's military said on Monday one Ukrainian serviceman was killed and four wounded in separatist eastern territories in the past 24 hours, underscoring the fragility of a two-week-old ceasefire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nonetheless, Ukraine reported a sharp drop in attacks from pro-Russian separatists over the weekend and said it was continuing to pull back heavy weapons from the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But it warned that rebels were using the truce to regroup for new attacks on government positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Military spokesman Andriy Lysenko also said pro-Russian rebels continued to receive a "significant" amount of military equipment from neighbouring Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Moscow has repeatedly denied that it is arming the separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The enemy is moving heavy weapons and military equipment, primarily in the area of Mariupol," Lysenko said in a televised briefing, referring to a government-held port city that Kiev fears could be the next rebel target.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A fall in the number of attacks and moves by both sides to withdraw heavy weapons from the front line had raised hopes that a fragile truce could hold, even after rebels disavowed last month's peace deal to seize the transport hub of Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"If the situation doesn't worsen, then the Ukrainian side will continue to pull back weapons. For now the process of withdrawal is ongoing," Lysenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Senior rebel commander Eduard Basurin said on Sunday separatists had completed their withdrawal of weapons and denied accusations from Kiev the arms were being returned to the front line, rebel press service DAN reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The deputy head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's mission in Ukraine has said the OSCE needed details on where withdrawn weapons were being stored, before it could confirm a real pull-back was taking place.</td></tr>
