<h3>Greece Bailout Deal Elusive, 'Significant' More Work Needed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's finance minister came under fire Friday from his peers in the 19-country eurozone for failing to come up with a comprehensive list of economic reforms that are needed if the country is to get vital loans to avoid going bankrupt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The eurozone's top official said time is running out for Greece to secure the money, adding that "significantly more progress" was required from Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Greek government has been stuck in talks with its creditors for weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It was a very critical discussion," said Jeroen Dijsselbloem at the conclusion of the meeting of the eurozone's 19 finance ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece had an end-of-April date to agree to more reforms in exchange for 7.2 billion euros ($7.8 billion) in rescue money its European creditors had set aside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Without the money, Greece faces potential bankruptcy and a possible exit from the euro, a development that many in global policymaking circles feel could damage the world's economic recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Expectations for a breakthrough were low going into Friday's meeting in the Latvian capital of Riga, and Dijsselbloem admitted the talks with Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis were tough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dijsselbloem said there were still "wide differences" between the two sides, without specifying where the problems lay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He also ruled out that the creditors might consider a half-way deal that could give Greece part of the 7.2 billion euros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Greece's Varoufakis conceded there were differences that still need to be bridged but insisted that a deal "will happen and will happen quickly as it's the only option we have."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He also sought to counter claims that talks had not advanced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said there's been a lot of progress on issues such as privatization, reforming the tax system, the judiciary, the bureaucracy and product markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We look at the last few weeks and what we see is convergence," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Varoufakis said the main sticking points related to pensions and the budget surplus Athens has to post after debt and interest payments are stripped out.</td></tr>
