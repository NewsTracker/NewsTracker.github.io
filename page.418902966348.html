<h3>Yahoo to roll out private video texting app</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Source: Yahoo!</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Imagine making a video call without other people being able to listen in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yahoo is trying to make that happen with Livetext, a new app that seeks to make video calling as private as texting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Yahoo says video calls can be better than texts for expressing emotions, but their audio component makes private conversations public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>With Livetext, you message friends by typing, just like texting, but you see video of friends without the audio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It's the latest example of Yahoo trying to catch up in mobile since Marissa Mayer became the company's CEO three years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype and other services already deliver video calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Yahoo's twist is silencing audio.</td></tr>
