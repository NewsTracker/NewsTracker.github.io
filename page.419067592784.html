<h3>A look at Egypt's Suez Canal, past and present</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) " Egypt is to unveil a major expansion of the Suez Canal on Thursday in what the government hopes will be a moment of national pride following years of political unrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Around 10 percent of the world's trade flows through the waterway, which links the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, allowing vessels to avoid sailing around Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The canal is one of Egypt's top foreign currency earners and is seen as a symbol of its modern state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The following is a brief overview of the canal, its storied history and the latest expansion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Khedive of Egypt, Ismail Pasha, inaugurated the original canal in 1869 in a ceremony celebrating the modernization of Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A French company founded by diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps had begun construction a decade earlier with capital raised by French investors and the Egyptian government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Egypt later sold its shares to imperial Britain because of a debt crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The canal was built using forced labor, with hundreds of thousands of Egyptian peasants drafted into low-wage digging work with hand tools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Thousands died before the practice was banned and steam-powered excavators took their place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Before building the Statue of Liberty, French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi proposed building a giant statue of a peasant woman holding a torch for the opening of the Suez Canal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Called "Egypt Bringing the Light to Asia," the statue was to stand at an entrance to the canal and the torch was to serve as a lighthouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In 1956, then-President Gamal Abdel-Nasser nationalized the canal from the British and French companies that owned it, a moment cherished by Egyptians as a defiant break from imperialist control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Britain, France and Israel invaded in response, but were ordered to withdraw by the United States and the Soviet Union, in what was seen across the Arab world as a defining victory for Abdel-Nasser and Arab nationalism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Egypt went on to fight two more wars against Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The last, in 1973, saw Egypt launch a surprise attack across the canal that is now remembered as the country's greatest battlefield victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The 1979 peace treaty with Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, placing the Suez Canal well inside its borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The canal has been repeatedly expanded over the years, from an initial length of 164 kilometers (102 miles) and a depth of 8 meters (26 feet).</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The latest expansion brings its length to 193 kilometers and its depth to 24 meters, allowing it to accommodate the world's largest vessels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The expansion will cut the time of a north-south passage from 18 to 11 hours, and a total of 97 ships will be able to pass every day, up from 49.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The canal drew in in a record $5.3 billion last year, a figure the government estimates it can raise to $13.2 billion by 2023.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Economists and shippers say that's overly optimistic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The government has billed the $8.5 billion mega-project, which is entirely funded by Egyptians, as a historic achievement and the start of a new era after the years of unrest that followed the 2011 overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The work was initially supposed to take three years, but President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi ordered it completed in one, saying the country urgently needed the economic boost it's expected to provide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The streets of Cairo have been decked with lights and flags in the lead-up to Thursday's inauguration, which is expected to be attended by el-Sissi and several foreign dignitaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Egypt's Cabinet has declared Thursday a public holiday and allowed free entrance to museums for Egyptians until the end of the month.</td></tr>
