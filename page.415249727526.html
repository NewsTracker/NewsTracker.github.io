<h3>BP signs $12B deal to develop Egypt gas field</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BP said in a statement that the investment is "a vote of confidence in Egypt's investment climate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The West Nile Delta project aims to produce 5 trillion cubic feet of gas and 55 million barrels of condensate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Production is expected to begin in 2017 and reach up to 1.2 billion cubic feet a day, or about 25 percent of Egypt's current production.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>BP Group Chief Executive Bob Dudley says the project is his company's "largest foreign direct investment in Egypt."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The announcement comes days ahead of a major economic conference aimed at boosting foreign investment in the country, which is still reeling from years of unrest following the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Thursday, Egypt's Investment Minister Ashraf Salman said the government hopes to attract up to $35 billion for about 50 projects at the conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Egypt has already attracted some $1.3 billion in foreign investment in the first quarter of the fiscal year, Salman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said the government hopes to reach $8 billion by the end of the fiscal year in June, nearly double the amount from the previous year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>BP's North Africa Regional President Hesham Mekawi described the gas project as "a critical milestone in the Egyptian oil and gas history. It marks the start of a major national project to add significant production to the domestic market."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Rising consumption has outstripped Egypt's domestic production, and over the past year Egyptians have endured prolonged power outages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The government has meanwhile struggled to maintain energy subsidies- estimated at around one fifth of the budget in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Egypt's major gas fields, most over 10 years old, are maxing out, and new ones won't start producing for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Oil and gas companies have balked at new investments, citing lingering instability and the government's insolvency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The ministry currently owes at least $4.5 billion to international oil and gas companies.</td></tr>

<h3>Real-Life Ron Swanson Afraid of Being Compared to Ron Swanson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Several of our nation's finest lawmakers have appeared on the NBC political comedy Parks and Recreation, but according to the show's creator, one senator backed out last minute when he started to worry the script was making fun of him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That person was our very own real-life Ron Swanson, Rand Paul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Paul was all lined up to have a cameo on Parks and Rec for its final season, but creator Mike Schur told Hitfix that he canceled at the 11th hour for fear of being compared to the show's beloved libertarian grump, Ron Swanson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I think he thought we were making fun of him, or something, which we were not, at all," Schur said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We were in fact flattering him, by linking him to Ron [Swanson]."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Rand should probably be afraid of comparisons to Ron Paul, not Ron Swanson.</td></tr>
