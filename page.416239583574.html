<h3>Report: Google to face antitrust charges in Europe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A published report says Europe's top antitrust regulator is poised to file charges alleging Google has been illegally using its dominant search engine to stifle competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Wall Street Journal says the European Union commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, has decided to pursue a case that will challenge Google's practice of highlighting its own services in its influential search results at the expense of its rivals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter, the Journal says Vestager consulted with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on her decision Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Google Inc. didn't respond to requests for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If it's filed, the antitrust case would escalate an investigation that began nearly five years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A legal battle could culminate in Google being fined about $6 billion and forced to change its practices.</td></tr>
