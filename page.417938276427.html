<h3>Morgan Stanley CEO expects Greece to stay in euro zone -paper</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FRANKFURT, June 21 The chief executive of Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley does not expect Greece to leave the euro zone, he told a German paper, but warned of the political impact that would follow such a scenario.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I don't think that Greece will leave the euro zone. There will be a compromise, the risk is too high," James Gorman told weekly Welt am Sonntag in an interview published on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The European Union has brought enormous benefits to its members over the past 50 years. Compared to this, the costs of a restructuring of Greek debt is small. To me this path makes much more sense that letting Greece fall," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Euro zone leaders will attend an emergency summit on Monday, hoping to thrash out a plan with Athens to provide Greece with funds to prevent it defaulting on its debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If Greece does default on its debts, it could require capital controls that might lead to its exit from the euro zone or even the European Union itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gorman said that the economic consequences in such a case would probably be manageable and the risk for the global economy limited, adding all stakeholders had had time to prepare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The political consequences, however, are unpredictable. There is no experience. I would be careful, I wouldn't let it happen," he said.</td></tr>
