<h3>3 French charged in IS-inspired plan to attack military base</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PARIS (AP) - The Paris prosecutor's office says three young men arrested this week in a plot to attack a military base were in contact with an Islamic State group jihadi who told them to "strike in France."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The prosecutor's statement said the suspects, who were arrested Monday, told investigators they planned a late December or early January attack on the Mediterranean military post Fort Bear, where the 23-year-old Djebril A., a former Marine, once worked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The two others, identified as Ismael K., 17, and Antoine F., 19, said the plan was to decapitate the base chief - a plot that Djebril denied.</td></tr>
