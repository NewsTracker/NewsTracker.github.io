<h3>White House: cannot confirm link between Yemen attack, Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"There is not, at this point, clear evidence of an operational link between these extremists in Yemen and ISIL fighters in Iraq and Syria," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, using a different acronym for Islamic State.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>"We call upon all actors within Yemen to halt all unilateral and offensive military actions, and we specifically call on the Houthis, former President Saleh and their allies to stop their violent incitement and undermining President Hadi, who is Yemen's legitimate president," said Jeff Rathke, a State Department spokesman.</td></tr>
