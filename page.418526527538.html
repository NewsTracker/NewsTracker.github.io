<h3>Klinsmann shakes up US roster for Gold Cup knockout rounds (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Jurgen Klinsmann spouted optimism after the United States played Panama to a 1-1 draw to wrap up the group stage of the Gold Cup, reasoning that despite a trio of sluggish performances the Americans had still survived unbeaten.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That didn't stop Klinsmann from shaking up his roster less than 24 hours later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The coach chose to add DaMarcus Beasley, Joe Corona and Alan Gordon for the knockout rounds, which begin with the quarterfinals Saturday in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Taking a seat are Greg Garza, Alfredo Morales and Jozy Altidore, who has been hampered by an ailing hamstring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Teams could make up to six roster changes using their 35-player preliminary list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Altidore started the first two games in the group stage but was substituted out of both.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was left on the bench against Panama on Monday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''We believe that Jozy's just not there yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jozy never really got into this tournament and never really picked up the rhythm,'' Klinsmann said in announcing the changes Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Klinsmann said he knew that Altidore might not be match fit when he selected him for the Gold Cup, and that's why Gordon was on standby from the beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Los Angeles Galaxy striker will make his 2015 debut for the national team after playing in the Gold Cup two years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Klinsmann said that the addition of the 33-year-old Beasley will provide leadership and experience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The four-time World Cup veteran captained the U.S. to the Gold Cup title two years ago but had announced his retirement from international competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''Having DaMarcus come into the team is huge, because of his character, his giving nature, the spirit he brings, but also the high quality he brings,'' Klinsmann said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''He brings a lot of experience into this group, and he's hungry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Corona, who scored twice in the Gold Cup two years ago, was added for his experience against teams from the Caribbean and Central America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He also is proficient at maintaining possession, something the Americans have struggled to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''In the tournament now we need to produce results and get things done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>With Joe, we have that option to bring him in now,'' Klinsmann said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''With his great technique, with his one-touch passing, he makes things very easy and simple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The U.S. finished 2-0-1 atop Group A, though the unblemished run wasn't without stress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Americans scuffled to a 2-1 victory over Honduras and needed a big play from Clint Dempsey for a 1-0 victory over Haiti.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Still, Klinsmann chose to highlight the quality of the group rather than his own team's shortcomings and insisted the U.S. is trending upward heading into the quarterfinals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''We can improve still a lot, absolutely,'' Klinsmann said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''You can take the game apart and see that we didn't have the passing rhythm we needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>We made mistakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Not everyone shared such robust optimism, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''We're not going to kid ourselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>We need to put together a 90-minute performance,'' said goalkeeper Brad Guzan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''Now going forward it's about wins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''We're trying to get everyone together,'' Dempsey explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>By that, he means the knockout stage, in which the Americans are still the heavy favorites to win the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''There's no real preparation for the Gold Cup, so it's difficult to be in a flow,'' Klinsmann said.</td></tr>
