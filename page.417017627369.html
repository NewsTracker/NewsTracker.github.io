<h3>CANNES WATCH: 'The Ghouls' ensemble enjoys fun camaraderie</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - The bond between the A-list stars of the new Chinese fantasy film "The Ghouls" clearly didn't stop when the group stopped filming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Huang Bo, Chen Kun, Shu Qi, Angela Baby, and Xia Yu poked fun at one another as they promoted the film in Cannes this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Shu said the ensemble truly enjoys each other's company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We've all been in the industry long enough and we know of each other," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"So when the five of us get together, we're like strangers who are close. We all like each other a lot. So when we get together, we just can't stop talking."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And teasing each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>During an interview, the actors - mostly veterans with the exception of the 26-year-old Angela Baby - started cracking jokes about each other's ages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chen, 39, quipped: "I grew up watching all of their films. I look younger and that's a fact. This doesn't take away my respect for them. Their films all taught me so much. Working with all these older brothers, sisters, uncles and aunties."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Who taught you how to behave," Huang, 40, finishing his sentence, adding: "I don't think you learned at all."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The 39-year-old Shu had her own humorous jab: "I was a child star, not like them who only began when they're so old."</td></tr>
