<h3>Ferguson voters head to polls to reshape City Council</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - Voters braved heavy rain and lightning to get to the polls Tuesday for municipal elections in Ferguson, where the next city council will face the daunting task of remaking much of the beleaguered St. Louis suburb's leadership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Three of the six council seats are up for grabs in the St. Louis suburb, which has been at the center of racial strife and national debate since a white police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The shooting prompted protests in the St. Louis area and nationally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It also prompted a review by the U.S. Justice Department, which released a scathing report blasting the city for racial bias and profiling in the police department and a profit-driven municipal court system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Several city officials resigned following the review, including the city manager, police chief and municipal judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The new city council will be tasked with approving hiring of the replacements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The scrutiny in the wake of the shooting also found that the city of 21,000 residents had a mostly white police force and city leadership - the mayor and five of the six council members are white - even though blacks make up about two-thirds of residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tuesday's election will add at least one black member to the council, maybe two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The lone current black councilman, Dwayne James, is not up for re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The race for the 3rd Ward, which includes the apartment complex where Brown was killed, involves two black men - Lee Smith, 76, and Wesley Bell, 40 - guaranteeing that an additional black resident will join the council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The 1st Ward features four candidates, two black and two white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 2nd Ward race involves two white men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ferguson Ward 1 city council candidate Adrienne Hawkins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Still, turnout is expected to be low, which isn't unique for municipal elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Turnout for the local election last April was 12.3 percent, said Eric Fey, director of elections for St. Louis County.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A strong push was made after the shooting to register more black voters, but Fey said just 562 new voters were added to the rolls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In recent weeks, the focus has been on getting those who are registered to vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On Tuesday, severe storms that roiled the region appeared to be dissuading would-be voters from venturing to the polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Fey said it wasn't immediately clear how many ballots had been cast as of mid-day, or how turnout compared to previous spring municipal elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"In general, so far what we've been hearing is (turnout) has been light. The weather has been very bad so far," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But the weather didn't deter Marty Einig, who has participated in Ferguson protests since August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He voted for Smith in the 3rd Ward, citing the candidate's endorsement by demonstrators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He said Bell's status as a municipal judge in nearby Velda City taints him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"To me, that renders him part of the problem," Einig, an engineer with a general contracting firm, said after voting at a church not far from Ferguson police station that has been a nexus of protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But Einig, 63, appeared buoyed by the election's potential.</td></tr>
