<h3>UN official says Ebola will end in Sierra Leone in weeks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The United Nations' Ebola chief says he believes it's only a matter of weeks before the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone ends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But Dr. David Nabarro says that stopping the deadly disease in Guinea will take more time because in some areas unsafe traditions still triumph over what's good for people's health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nabarro said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday that the Ebola epidemic "absolutely isn't over" though Liberia has been Ebola free since May 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We have cases occurring, not in huge numbers but enough to be very disturbing, in Sierra Leone and in Guinea," he said, and the situation in Guinea is especially troubling because surprise cases have been popping up that are not part of known chains of transmission.</td></tr>
