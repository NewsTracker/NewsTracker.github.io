<h3>Braves designate Quinten for assignment; Grilli new closer (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Nationals won 9-8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MIAMI (AP) -- Hours before Monday's season opener, Atlanta Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez assessed his team's latest moves and didn't try to spin them as an upgrade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''It's a big boy's world,'' Gonzalez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On the eve of the season, the Braves traded All-Star closer Craig Kimbel and outfielder Melvin Upton Jr. to the San Diego Padres for outfielders Cameron Maybin and Carlos Quinten, two minor leaguers and a draft pick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Quinten never joined the Braves, and the two-time All-Star was designated for assignment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Maybin arrived before the opener against the Miami Marlins but wasn't in the starting lineup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Veteran right-hander Jason Grilli was given the closer job, with right-hander Jim Johnson his backup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Grilli has 50 career saves, including 33 with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''We feel like if the team gives us a lead, these guys will be able to shut it down for us,'' Gonzalez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Maybin will play some against left-handers and be used as a late-inning defensive replacement in center field, Gonzalez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Braves' motive for the trade was to unload the remaining $46.35 million on the underachieving Upton's contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Even so, the loss of Kimbrel was a blow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He has had at least 45 saves each of the past four seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The trade was the latest in a series of rebuilding moves by the Braves since a late-season collapse that cost them a 2014 playoff berth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They have only six players who were on the opening day roster a year ago, the fewest in the majors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The objective this year hasn't changed, however, Gonzalez said.</td></tr>
