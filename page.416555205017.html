<h3>Scientist Hawking tells upset fans Malik may be in parallel One Direction</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(Reuters) - What is the cosmological effect of singer Zayn Malik leaving the best-selling boy band One Direction and consequently disappointing millions of teenage girls around the world?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The advice of British cosmologist Stephen Hawking to heartbroken fans is to follow theoretical physics, because Malik may well still be a member of the pop group in another universe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The physicist took a break from speaking about his work as one of the world's leading scientists to answer the question from one upset fan during a talk at Sydney Opera House at the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Finally a question about something important," Hawking, who appeared via hologram, said to loud laughs from the audience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"My advice to any heartbroken young girl is to pay attention to the study of theoretical physics because, one day, there may well be proof of multiple universes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It would not be beyond the realms of possibility that somewhere outside of our own universe lies another, different universe and, in that universe, Zayn is still in One Direction."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The wheelchair-bound scientist, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the age of 21, appeared at the talk in the form of a hologram streamed from Cambridge, England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Malik quit the band last month, saying he wanted to live a normal life after five years of touring and performing.</td></tr>
