<h3>BT lashes out in battle over future of broadband network</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BT&#x2019;s rearguard action came after Ofcom launched a once-in-a-decade review of the telecoms market last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The regulator&#x2019;s move seized on by Sky and TalkTalk to press for BT Openreach, the division that builds and maintains its physical infrastructure, providing rivals with wholesale access, to be split off into a separate company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Such a "structural separation" would deprive BT of its cash cow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Openreach generates 1.5bn of the company&#x2019;s 2.5bn annual free cash flow, helping to support the heavy investment in sport by BT&#x2019;s retail arm under Mr Petter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rivals also argue Openreach provides poor service and fails to meet repair targets because the current structure does not encourage it to invest enough in its operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Petter said Ofcom&#x2019;s review was &#x201c;a reasonable thing to have&#x201d; but claimed splitting BT would be a &#x201c;huge mistake&#x201d; that would limit superfast broadband investment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The retail arm of BT acted as a guaranteed customer for Openreach, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Petter pointed to countries where structural separation of the former state monopoly has gone through, such as New Zealand, that have suffered lower broadband investment and higher prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>&#x201c;Those who argue for this ignore the importance of having a key anchor tenant to underpin the big investments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>&#x201c;The retail arm of BT was the only internet provider to market fibre in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>&#x201c;I expect we will hear some criticisms of Openreach customer service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I am a customer of Openreach too and yes, of course, the service isn&#x2019;t perfect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But overall it works actually and it is much improved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>&#x201c;I personally get very cross listening to the armchair generals who criticise the work done by Openreach engineers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Sky and TalkTalk have teamed up on a pilot project in York to install ultrafast broadband, laying new fibre-optic lines all the way into homes, partly to put pressure on Openreach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Petter dismissed the project, saying that while its rivals are connecting 20,000 homes altogether in an urban areas, BT is using Government subsidies to upgrade the broadband available 60,000 rural homes per week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said: &#x201c;They certainly have very deep pockets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>BT&#x2019;s current structure was backed on Tuesday by HSBC telecoms analyst Stephen Howard, who said splitting the company would be an &#x201c;unnecessary admission of defeat&#x201d; in a vibrant broadband market.</td></tr>

<h3>Boko Haram kills one in north Cameroon attack: army</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The militants rode on motorbikes into Golfo, about 3 km (1.86 miles) from the Nigerian border and started shooting at a crowd, the officer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"They killed a civilian and wounded two others before riding back into Nigeria," he said by telephone from Maroua.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A local newspaper, L'Oeil du Sahel, reported that two people were killed in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Armies from Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger have launched an offensive to end Boko Haram's six-year insurgency which has killed thousands and threatened the stability of the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Nigerian army said on Tuesday it had repelled Boko Haram from all but three local government districts in the northeast, claiming victory for its offensive against the Islamist insurgents less than two weeks before a presidential election.</td></tr>
