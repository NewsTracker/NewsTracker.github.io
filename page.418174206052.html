<h3>Stephen Curry overtakes LeBron James for NBA's top jersey (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OAKLAND, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Stephen Curry has surpassed LeBron James for the most popular jersey in the NBA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Golden State Warriors star and league MVP topped the list of jersey sales in the NBA for the first time Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With teammates Klay Thompson ranking fifth and Draymond Green at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>15, the Warriors also led the team-merchandise sales list during the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>James, who held the top spot at the end of the regular season, dropped to second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chicago's Derrick Rose is third and Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving is fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Following the NBA champion Warriors on the team-merchandise sales list are the Cavaliers, Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The league based the rankings on overall sales on NBAStore.com from April through June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The latest figures cap Curry's incredible year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He led the Warriors to a franchise-record 67 wins - plus 16 more in the playoffs - and their first championship in 40 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Curry was the leading vote-getter for the All-Star teams, won the 3-point contest and took home NBA MVP honors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Warriors beat James and the injury-depleted Cavaliers in six games in the finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>And unlike James, who is in his second stint in Cleveland after four years with Miami, Curry has never changed jerseys - which usually leads to more sales.</td></tr>
