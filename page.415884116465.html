<h3>Man Accused in Ferguson Police Shooting Denied Lower Bond</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Williams, 20, is accused of shooting two police officers on March 12, during an early-morning rally sparked by the resignation of Ferguson's police chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A Missouri judge on Tuesday refused to reduce the bond of a 20-year-old man accused of shooting and wounding two police officers during a Ferguson protest, despite an attorney's insistence that the man was beaten by police into wrongly confessing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jeffrey Williams, shackled at the wrists and ankles, said nothing during a 10-minute hearing in which his attorney, Jerryl Christmas, failed to sway a St. Louis County judge to cut Williams' $300,000 cash bond to one that would require him to pay only $10,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Christmas argued that the jobless Williams has no history of violence, has a girlfriend who is eight months pregnant and deserved a bond akin to cases where the shooting victims survive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He suggested that a $300,000 bond was more traditional in homicide cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But prosecutor Bart Calhoun countered that Williams - charged with felony assault, armed criminal action and a weapons offense - poses a public risk if freed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Calhoun said the gunfire early March 12 was "a drive-by shooting that put a great number of citizens at risk."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The shooting occurred during a protest sparked by the resignation of Ferguson's police chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Both officers, who are expected to recover, were monitoring protests outside the city's police station, which has been a nexus of unrest since a white Ferguson officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Calhoun noted that when Williams was arrested for the shooting, he was being sought on a warrant alleging he violated probation terms related to his use of a stolen credit card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Clearly, I don't think the current bond is unreasonable," the prosecutor told the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Prosecutors allege that Williams told investigators he fired a gun but was aiming at someone else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Christmas said his client has recanted that story, told him he never shot a weapon that day and only confessed after being roughed up by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Tuesday, Calhoun told the judge "the evidence in this case is overwhelming," adding that Williams admitted being the gunman "to several people after his arrest."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"He said he never fired a weapon. He didn't have a weapon," Christmas told reporters after the hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said police beat the alleged confession out of Williams, and "I just don't believe that any statements were made voluntarily."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman has called Christmas' assertions "completely false."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Schellman said Williams was seen by a nurse when he was booked into the county jail - standard procedure for all incoming inmates - who deemed him "fit for confinement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ferguson has been a national focal point since Brown was killed Aug. 9 by then-police officer Darren Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A grand jury declined to indict Wilson in November, and Wilson was cleared of civil rights charges by a U.S. Justice Department report released March 4.</td></tr>
