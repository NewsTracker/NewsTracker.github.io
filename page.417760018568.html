<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Construction work on Egypt's New Suez Canal project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ismailiya, Egypt: Egypt will inaugurate a "new Suez canal" shipping route in August aimed at speeding up traffic along the existing waterway and boosting revenues, officials say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dubbed the Suez Canal Axis, the new 72-kilometre project will run part of the way alongside the existing canal that connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The digging and dredging operations will be completed on July 15," Suez Canal Authority chief Mohab Mameesh told reporters in the canal city of Ismailiya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A ceremony will be held on August 6 to inaugurate the project, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi launched the project in August and set an ambitious target of digging the new canal in one year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Once the president inaugurates it, vessels will start moving through the new waterway," Mr Mameesh said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said 85 per cent of the project, which is being executed by the army, has been completed so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Authorities raised $US9 billion ($11.6 billion) to build the new canal by selling shares in the project to domestic investors, with private Egyptian companies tasked with its construction.</td></tr>
