<h3>Capitals LW Alex Ovechkin reaches 50 goals for 6th time (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Russian left wing netted his league-leading No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>50 a little more than 11 minutes into the first period, giving Washington a 2-0 lead when he took a pass from Evgeny Kuznetsov and sent a shot from just inside the left circle past goalie Cam Ward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Only five other players have a half-dozen seasons in which they reached the half-century mark: Wayne Gretzky and Mike Bossy did it nine times each, and Mario Lemieux, Marcel Dionne and Guy Lafleur had six such seasons apiece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The goal was the 472nd of Ovechkin's career, which tied him with Peter Bondra for the most by a member of the Capitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ovechkin, a three-time NHL MVP, is playing in his 10th season for Washington, and Tuesday's game was his 755th, more than 200 fewer than Bondra's 961 with the franchise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ovechkin already owned team records for points, power-play goals, game-winning goals and shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He scored his 48th and 49th goals of the season in Washington's previous game, a 5-2 victory at the New York Rangers on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>After getting his 50th, Ovechkin dropped his left knee to the ice and pumped his right glove, then thrust both arms overhead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Many fans responded with chants of ''M-V-P!</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>M-V-P!'' and then rose to give him a standing ovation when the goal was announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Under new coach Barry Trotz, Ovechkin moved back to left wing this season, his primary position for most of his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A year ago, he led the NHL with 51 goals while playing mostly on the right side under previous coach Adam Oates.</td></tr>
