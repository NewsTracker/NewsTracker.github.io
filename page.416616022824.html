<h3>At empty Camden Yards, Chris Davis hits 3-run homer, Orioles beat white Sox 8-2</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE - In what was believed to be the first major league game played without fans in attendance, Chris Davis hit a three-run homer in a six-run first inning Wednesday and the Baltimore Orioles beat the Chicago White Sox 8-2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The gates at Camden Yards were locked because of concern for fan safety following recent rioting in Baltimore after a 25-year-old black man died in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The unusual decision to play the game was made because it was the best time to fill out the schedule for both teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Both teams lined up for the national anthem, music was piped in between innings and the seventh inning streak was noted with the traditional John Denver song.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And the Orioles and White Sox played their game - albeit five hours earlier and in an eerily quiet ballpark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a crisp 2 hours, 3 minutes, Baltimore won its third straight since snapping a five-game losing streak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ubaldo Jimenez (2-1) continued his rebound from last season's struggles, allowing two runs - one earned - on three hits with six strikeouts and just one walk over seven innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Manny Machado hit his fourth home run among his three hits and Caleb Joseph had a pair of RBIs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>White Sox right-hander Jeff Samardzija (1-2) allowed a season-high eight runs - seven earned - on 10 hits, including two homers, over just five innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Entering the game, he had not allowed a run over his previous 10 innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Orioles batted around against Samardzija in the first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>With the bases loaded, Adam Jones hit a sacrifice fly and Davis followed with a three-run homer that landed on a nearly empty Eutaw Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A double by Everth Cabrera and a single by Joseph rounded out the scoring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Samardzija continued to labor, allowing another RBI single to Joseph in the third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Machado's fifth error in the past eight games on a grounder by Alexei Ramirez gave Chicago its first run in the fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A ground-out by Geovany Soto later that inning pulled them to 7-2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Machado made up for his mistake with a solo that inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Orioles: SS J.J. Hardy (left shoulder strain) felt much better after receiving a cortisone shot last week and will travel with the team to Tampa Bay over the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He hopes to begin a rehab assignment next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>White Sox: Chris Sale, who appealed his five-game suspension for his role in a brawl with the Royals, will look to pick up his third win four starts on Thursday against Minnesota.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Orioles: Chris Tillman (2-2, 7.58 ERA) will open the series Friday against the Rays, which has been moved to Tropicana Field from Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Orioles, though, will be the home team.</td></tr>
