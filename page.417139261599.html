<h3>Google adds tweets to mobile search</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LOS ANGELES - It's official: Google is indexing Twitter in real time again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The search giant started to add tweets to search results on mobile devices Tuesday, and promises to bring Twitter data to desktop search in the near future as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Indexing will initially be limited to English-language tweets, but Twitter and Google promised to expand the collaboration to additional languages in the coming months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Users will be able to search these tweets in the Google search apps on iOS and Android as well as when accessing Google.com with a mobile browser, but desktop integration is supposed to be added in the near future as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google used to index Twitter's data in real time, but was forced to stop doing so when a commercial partnership between the two companies ended in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Reports of a new deal first surfaced in February, with Bloomberg at the time reporting that Google was paying Twitter licensing fees as opposed to a percentage of ad revenue to get access to its so-called fire hose of real-time tweet data.</td></tr>
