<h3>Now you can find your lost phone with a Google search</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Have a crazy night?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kids steal your Android phone to play Angry Birds?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Are you reading this from a tablet as you reach desperately under your bed?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Well, search no longer, Android users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google has introduced something even simpler than using Apple's "Find My iPhone" app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>All you need to do is type "find my phone" into Google, and it will bring up a map with your phone's location on it and give you the ability to set off the ringtone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It takes minimal effort to set up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Your phone has to have the latest Google app installed on it, plus your phone and desktop browser need to be signed into the same Google account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But after that, finding your phone is as easy as Googling your next online date.</td></tr>
