<h3>Paula Goldman's menagerie of Hagen-Renaker collectibles</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The animal figurines made by Hagen-Renaker Inc. are delicate, shiny, hand-painted collectibles - not what you would think of as the subject of a photo series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But photographer Paula Goldman looked at them and saw possibilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She reached out to the company's owner, Susan Renaker Nikas, with an unusual request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Susan Renaker Nikas, who owns and manages Hagen-Renaker, paints a horse figurine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mama Fox and Baby Fox designed by Helen Perrin Farnlund as photographed by Paula Goldman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Puss in Boots" by Helen Perrin Farnlund as photographed by Paula Goldman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Notice the head of his walking stick is an ivory mouse head," said Hagen-Renaker owner Susan Renaker Nikas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"That attention to detail was so typical of Helen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Susan Renaker Nikas owns and manages Hagen-Renaker, which was established by her father 70 years ago in San Dimas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A look at "Country Mice" designed by Helen Perrin Farnlund as photographed by Paula Goldman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Goldman, who for the last 20 years has made a living photographing objects for museums, galleries and libraries, wanted to do the same for Hagen-Renaker creations, but not as if she were shooting for a catalog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Instead, she treated each like she would a portrait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nikas selected about 50 figurines for Goldman to photograph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Each choice was carefully made to represent the six artists, all but one now deceased, who created the molds for the figurines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Nell [Bortells] had a raffish comical style that came through in what she was doing, Helen [Perrin Farnlund] was somebody who could make an armadillo cute, and Maureen Calvert was absolutely accurate as far as her depictions of animals," said Nikas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Her horses are prized by horse model collectors."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>This last thought intrigued Goldman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The whole concept of why and what people collect fascinates me," she wrote in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I think these figures fit right in with Meissen, Lladro, and even those scary Hummels."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Goldman's pictures are glossy and brightly lighted so that the kiln-fired curves of the figurines shine as if bathed in sunshine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>They are placed against a variety of backgrounds: gray silk for a trio of cheerful country mice in overalls, fireworks for a tow-headed child in a green jacket, a blue velvet theater curtain and felt stage for a family of azure-eyed Siamese cats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The level of craftsmanship in these figures is remarkable, as is the dedication of the remaining employees who hand-paint each one," wrote Goldman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>At its height, 70-year-old Hagen-Renaker operated two factories with 300 employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>These days, it has just one factory and 18 employees in San Dimas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Collectors of the vintage figurines pay hundreds of dollars for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>There's an online store and museum devoted to them; it's run by Florida aficionado Ed Alcorn and his wife, Sheri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The site boasts more than 1,200 pictures of more than 4,500 Hagen-Renaker objects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Goldman hopes her work will help people understand the cultural importance and context of the figurines without being "overwhelmed by a discussion of kitsch."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"They deserve to be treated with respect," Goldman wrote of the figurines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>As do the designers who once created them, said Nikas.</td></tr>
