<h3>Western leaders hint at more Russian sanctions over Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The threats came in statements issued after a video conference that brought together Obama and the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy, as well as the head of the European Council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The virtual meeting took place amid continuing violence in Ukraine despite the two-week-old ceasefire accord reached in Minsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama used the call to condemn Russia for not following through on its agreements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It was an opportunity ... for the president to condemn the continuing failure of Russia and the separatists it backs to abide by the commitments to which they agreed," Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The top U.S. military officer, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey, told a Senate hearing on Tuesday the United States should "absolutely" consider providing lethal weapons to Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He acknowledged that Russia could take Ukraine if it wanted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Dempsey said the United States should look for opportunities to level the playing field between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists, in the unlikely event "the Russians are actually telling the truth" when they deny aiding their sympathizers in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Obama and the European leaders agreed that a major breach of the ceasefire pact would make a "strong reaction from the international community" necessary, the office of French President Francois Hollande said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Leaders will be ready to decide on further sanctions if the Minsk agreements are further violated," said a European Union statement that was echoed by one from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The French statement also said the parties wanted to bolster the resources of monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), a European rights and security watchdog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>European leaders on Monday said they agreed that the OSCE needed a broader role as observers of the ceasefire and removal of weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Tuesday, Kiev announced its highest casualty toll in several days, with three Ukrainian servicemen dead and nine wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Later this week, Ukraine's parliament is expected to back Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's request for international peacekeepers to monitor the conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That idea, however, has faced a chilly reception in Europe.</td></tr>

<h3>Mexico raided migrant train 153 times in last year</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Following a surge in child migrants reaching the U.S. border in 2014, Mexican authorities said Tuesday, March 3, 2015 that they staged more than 150 raids over the last year on the train known as "La Bestia" that rolled toward the U.S. border crowded with hundreds of Central American migrants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - Mexican authorities said Tuesday they staged 153 raids over the last year on a train known as "La Bestia" that rolled toward the U.S. border crowded with hundreds of Central American migrants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Following a big surge in child migrants reaching the U.S. border last year, Mexico's government cracked down on routes commonly used by migrants to travel from Guatemala to the U.S. border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The head of the National Immigration Institute, Ardelio Vargas, said the 153 train raids were part of 758 immigration inspections over the last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Raids were also carried out on bars, restaurants and hotels were migrants were either held or forced to work, and immigration agents also targeted buses, trucks and other means of smuggling migrants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Authorities began setting up highway checkpoints and raiding trains in mid-2014 to discourage clandestine migration from Central American countries like Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But it was the train - a decrepit freight line where boxcar roofs were once completely covered with migrants - that drew Mexico's greatest attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While some suspected the first raids on the train in August were merely for show, Vargas said Mexico intends to keep migrants off the boxcars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The consequences of a railroad accident with 700 or 1,200 migrants on board would have been very regrettable," Vargas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We can't be so irresponsible as to allow migrants to continue risking their lives on a freight line that has all the deficiencies it has."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There are some indications that migrants may have switched to taking buses, a somewhat more expensive route through Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Tuesday, the institute reported that 101 Central Americans were caught aboard two buses in the north-central state of Zacatecas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Vargas also said Mexican immigration agents assisted 23,078 child migrants of various nationalities between January 2014 and February 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It was not clear how many of those minors were repatriated to their home countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Vargas said 37 percent of the minors - or about 8,540 - were unaccompanied.</td></tr>
