<h3>Greece Pays IMF Debt; Leader Notes Steps Taken Toward Deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece completed a 757 million-euro ($844 million) debt payment to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday despite a cash shortage in government coffers in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece's government has taken as "many steps as possible" toward reaching an agreement with bailout lenders, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said, despite renewed calls from creditors for tough reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The radical left Syriza-led government, elected in January, is locked in slow-moving bailout negotiations with international creditors and is seeking the release of stalled rescue loan money as state coffers run low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The cash crisis is expected to come to a head in the next few weeks, with more IMF repayments looming in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The government has already ordered local authorities, universities and hospitals to put their reserves in the central bank to help ease the cash crunch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It is now the turn of our (European) partners to take the steps needed," Tsipras told ministers during a five-hour cabinet meeting to discuss the debt negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Athens is under pressure to liberalize labor markets further and reduce high state funding for pensions - moves it has promised to resist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We must protect workers and pensioners, and protect working families whose (income) has been looted for the past five years by ineffective austerity measures under the bailout agreements," Tsipras said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At a meeting in Brussels on Monday, Eurozone finance ministers said they were still expecting more detailed proposals from Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble argued that the atmosphere had improved in negotiations but little had changed in substance.</td></tr>
