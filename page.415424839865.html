<h3>Bowler throws grenade instead of ball in east Ukraine; authorities urge care with explosives</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A separatist-run news agency cited emergency services official Sergei Ivanushkin as saying Friday that the separatist-held parts of Luhansk region have seen a spate of accidents recently because of careless use of explosives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ivanushkin said a man and woman were hospitalized after Thursday's incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The blast occurred at a "cheburechnaya" - a restaurant serving fried pastries - that also offered duckpin bowling, which uses a ball without holes on a relatively short lane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>East Ukraine has been wracked by war for almost a year, during which time the region has become flooded with small arms and grenades.</td></tr>
