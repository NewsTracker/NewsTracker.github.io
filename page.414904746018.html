<h3>White House mulls how to counter Netanyahu on Iran</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>President Barack Obama does not intend to be silent or out of sight when Netanyahu addresses Congress in a visit that was arranged by Speaker John Boehner behind the administration's back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The breach of protocol has grown to what seems like a grudge match between two men who dislike each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Vice President Biden will be out of town during Netanyahu's speech, leaving an empty chair behind the Israeli leader's podium and Secretary of State John Kerry may conveniently find a foreign trip to be on that day as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - In what is becoming an increasingly nasty grudge match, the White House is mulling ways to undercut Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming trip to Washington and blunt his message that a potential nuclear deal with Iran is bad for Israel and the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There are limits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Administration officials have discarded the idea of President Barack Obama himself giving an Iran-related address to rebut the two speeches Netanyahu is to deliver during his early March visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But other options remain on the table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Among them: a presidential interview with a prominent journalist known for coverage of the rift between Obama and Netanyahu, multiple Sunday show television appearances by senior national security aides and a pointed snub of America's leading pro-Israel lobby, which is holding its annual meeting while Netanyahu is in Washington, according to the officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The administration has already ruled out meetings between Netanyahu and Obama, saying it would be inappropriate for the two to meet so close to Israel's March 17 elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the White House is now doubling down on a cold-shoulder strategy, including dispatching Cabinet members out of the country and sending a lower-ranking official than normal to represent the administration at the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Vice President Joe Biden will be away, his absence behind Netanyahu conspicuous in coverage of the speech to Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Other options were described by officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Netanyahu's plan for a March 3 address to a joint meeting of Congress has further strained already tense ties between the U.S. and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Congressional Republicans orchestrated Netanyahu's visit without consulting the White House or State Department, a move the Obama administration blasted as a break in diplomatic protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some Democratic lawmakers say they will boycott the speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>U.S. officials believe Netanyahu's trip to Washington is aimed primarily at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, Obama's signature foreign policy objective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>While Netanyahu has long been skeptical of the negotiations, his opposition has increased over what he sees as Obama's willingness to make concessions that would leave Iran on the brink of being able to build a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>His opposition has intensified as negotiations go into overdrive with an end-of-March deadline for a framework deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I think this is a bad agreement that is dangerous for the state of Israel, and not just for it," Netanyahu said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The difference of opinion over the deal has become unusually rancorous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The White House and State Department have both publicly accused Israeli officials of leaking "cherry-picked" details of the negotiations to try to discredit the administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And, in extraordinary admissions this week, the administration acknowledged that the U.S. is withholding sensitive details of the talks from Israel, its main Middle East ally, to prevent such leaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The rebukes have only emboldened the leader of Israel, whose country Iran has threatened to annihilate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He has a double-barrel attack on the Iran talks ready for when he arrives in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Not only will he address Congress, he will also deliver similar remarks at the AIPAC conference, an event to which administrations past and present have traditionally sent top foreign policy officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>An AIPAC official said Friday that the group has not yet received any reply to its invitation for senior administration figures to attend the meeting that starts March 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The official stressed that last-minute RSVPs are not unusual, but the White House has been signaling for some time that a Cabinet-level guest may not coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Instead, the administration is toying with the idea of sending newly installed Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken to speak to the conference, according to officials familiar with internal discussions on the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But it's possible Treasury Secretary Jack Lew could attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, who have both previously addressed AIPAC, will be out of the country on foreign travel that appears to have been arranged to make them unavailable to speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Biden will be visiting Uruguay and Guatemala on a trip that was announced after Netanyahu's speech was scheduled, while the State Department announced abruptly this week that Kerry will be traveling to as-yet-determined destinations for the duration of the AIPAC conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Obama spoke to AIPAC in 2012, while he was in the midst of his re-election campaign.</td></tr>

<h3>Eating meat is hurting the environment - stop consuming so much, top US nutritional panel says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The country's foremost nutrition advisory panel is taking a stand against meat: Americans should eat less of it, top experts say, in order to protect the environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The recommendation by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee could have a significant impact on the amount of meat people eat - as well as the environmental impact of a carnivorous nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We're not saying that people need to become vegans," said Miriam Nelson, a professor at Tufts University and one of the committee's members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"But we are saying that people need to eat less meat."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The panel's findings, which were released to the public in the form on a 572-page report this afternoon, specifically recommend that Americans be kinder to the environment by eating more plant-based foods and fewer animal-based foods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The panel is confident that the country can align both health goals and environmental aims, but warns that the US diet, as currently constructed, could improve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Consistent evidence indicates that, in general, a dietary pattern that is higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with lesser environmental impact than is the current average US diet," the report says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Americans, though they are eating less meat than they have in the past, are still eating too much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The problem, which the committee's findings reflect, is that all that meat eating is still having too much of an impact on the environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Meat eaters have been linked to considerably larger carbon footprint than vegetarians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And the livestock industry has been associated with a considerably larger carbon footprint than any other food industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The combination of those two realities, along with the committee's understanding that diets lower in meat consumption, especially red and processed meat consumption, tend to be more healthful, has forced the committee's hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The group, which has been mulling a number of changes to the dietary guidelines, has traditionally advised the government about healthy eating choices which, until now, have only reflected what the group views as a diet that is healthy for humans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The new recommendations mark a major break from the past, and offer a glimpse into what the guidelines might look like in the decades to come.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"If we're thinking about the foods that are culturally appropriate, we need to start thinking about what's sustainable," Nelson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Other countries have already started doing this - including sustainability in their recommendations. We should be doing it too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The meat industry, for its part, vehemently objects to the notion that Americans should be eating less meat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The North American Meat Institute has repeatedly questioned whether the nutrition panel should be allowed to include sustainability concerns in its recommendations, and challenged the notion that meat negatively impacts the environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"If our government believes Americans should factor sustainability into their choices, guidance should come from a panel of sustainability experts that understands the complexity of the issue," Barry Carpenter, the Chief Executive of The North American Meat Institute, said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The official dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years, won't be released until later this year, after the department of Health and Human Services mulls over the advisory committee's recommendations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The panel's suggestions are, ultimately, suggestions, which the government doesn't have to act upon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But historically, the government has incorporated the panel's suggestions, especially those that recommend changes and updates, into its guidance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>If the government acts upon the panel's recommendations to suggest lower meat intake, the impact on the meat industry will be significant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>While Americans don't necessarily heed the dietary guidelines ahead of each meal, the guidelines do influence prevalent health narratives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>They also help dictate what is on the menu of federal feeding programs, like the school lunch program.</td></tr>
