<h3>Here Are The Top 10 Part-Time Jobs For 2015</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But choosing a part-time job should not mean that workers have to sacrifice their happiness or well-being.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Job database website CareerCast set out to evaluate 200 different part-time and temporary employment opportunities to see which ones are the best bets for American workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In its annual Jobs Rated Report, released Tuesday, the team at CareerCast used data from the U.S. Department of Labor and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to review jobs on the basis of four "core criteria" relevant to every work experience: environment, stress, income and potential career outlook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Each criterion was divided into subcategories -- for example, the environment category was broken down to account for various emotional and physical factors -- and each subcategory was assigned a numerical ranking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>CareerCast gave one-third of the weighted score to a combination of stress and environment, one-third of the weighted score to income and the final third of the weighted score to potential career outlook, which accounted for such factors as potential for income growth and unemployment rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>These overall rankings were then used to compare each part-time job and determine which options proved most desirable across the board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Part-time employment was defined as anywhere from one to 34 hours of work per week, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The report identified several trends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Because many companies still cannot afford to hire a team of information technology professionals on site, part-time computer programmers and network administrators do particularly well financially as they hop from assignment to assignment between businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>When it comes to seasonal success, accountants experience an incredible spike in demand come tax time, and product delivery workers do particularly well around the holidays.</td></tr>

<h3>NYT: Hillary Clinton may have broken federal record-keeping laws</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The New York Times is reporting that she may have violated federal records laws by using a personal email account for all of her work messages while at the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may have violated federal records laws by using a personal email account for all of her work messages, the New York Times reported on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The newspaper said the likely Democratic presidential candidate conducted all her official business during her four-year tenure at the State Department on a private email account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Her aides took no actions to have her personal emails preserved on department servers at the time, as required by the Federal Records Act," according to the Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It added that Clinton, who stepped down as secretary of state in 2013, recently handed over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department in response to a department effort to comply with record-keeping practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The newspaper report that "Clinton's personal email account was discovered by a House committee investigating the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi as it sought correspondence between Mrs. Clinton and her aides."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Federal law says letters and emails written and received by federal officials are government records that must be retained, according to the paper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Regulations at the time Clinton served as secretary of state called for emails on personal accounts to be preserved as well, the paper said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Times said most experts believed private email accounts should only be used for official government business in emergencies, according to the Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario - short of nuclear winter - where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business," said Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle & Reath who is a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton told the Times that Clinton was complying with the "letter and spirit of the rules" and had expected her emails would be retained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He declined to detail why she chose to conduct business from her personal account, the Times said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The State Department did not immediately return a request for comment from Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Clinton's spokesman could also not be immediately reached for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The newspaper reported that it remains unclear if Clinton's "private email account included encryption or other security measures, given the sensitivity of her diplomatic activity."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>According to the Times, Secretary of State John Kerry uses a government email account but before the current regulations took hold, Secretary of State Colin Powell used personal email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Clinton is widely considered the front-runner for next year's Democratic presidential nomination if she decides to enter the race.</td></tr>
