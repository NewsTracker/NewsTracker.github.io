<h3>Short Film Explores The Unexpected Beauty Of Vintage Maps</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Living History: The John Feathers Map Collection" is the the story of an extraordinary hidden treasure and a glimpse into the reclusive soul that protected it for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The story begins with Glen Creason, Map Librarian at Los Angeles Central Library and author of Los Angeles in Maps, who recounts his experience in October 2012 when a real estate agent rang him about a soon-to-be-demolished house in Mt. Washington that was "full of maps".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Thinking he'd find a box of National Geographics at best, Creason reluctantly set out for the house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But once he arrived he discovered so many precious maps that he had to return with a truck and an army of volunteers to cart them away.</td></tr>

<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu claims 'worldwide' effort to defeat Likud as Israeli election looms</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jerusalem: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told supporters there is "a tremendous effort, worldwide, to topple" him as Israelis head to the polls next week, according to an Army Radio broadcast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Little context was provided for the 12-second clip of Mr Netanyahu, speaking to activists in his Likud Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But it came after weeks in which his supporters have accused US President Barack Obama of meddling in Israeli politics because a top strategist from Mr Obama's campaigns is advising a Tel Aviv group whose goal is to replace the current government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu campaigns for re-election in the coastal city of Netanya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The strategist, Jeremy Bird, an architect of the grassroots and online organising effort that propelled Mr Obama into the White House, is consulting with the group, V15, which helped bring 35,000 people to an anti-Netanyahu rally at the weekend in Tel Aviv's Rabin Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Netanyahu, in turn, has been criticised in Israel and abroad for interfering in American politics by speaking about the Iranian nuclear program last week in the US Congress at the invitation of the Speaker of the House, a Republican, and against the wishes of the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Prime Minister said during a visit to an Israeli military headquarters in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday that since that speech, "I get the impression that there are more and more voices, especially in the US but also in other places, that support Israel's position".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, co-leaders of the centrist Zionist Union, outline their party's election platform in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A week before the elections, polls show the rightist Likud neck and neck with the centre-left Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Both camps are vying to pull votes from smaller parties and win over an unusually large pool of voters who remain undecided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The battle is very close, nothing is guaranteed", Mr Netanyahu told his party activists on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It is not guaranteed because there is a tremendous effort, worldwide, to topple the Likud government."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Rafi Smith, a leading Israeli pollster, said on Tuesday that the dynamics of the campaign had shifted in recent weeks and a growing margin of voters were calling for change even as the largest group viewed Mr Netanyahu as best suited for the top job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market while on the campaign trail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>By creating the Zionist Union, Mr Smith told a group of international journalists, Isaac Herzog of the Labor Party and Tzipi Livni of the small Hatnua faction "changed the atmosphere" from the last election in 2013, when Mr Netanyahu's re-election was never in doubt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The main difference in this election is that we're actually asking who is going to be prime minister of Israel," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"In 2013, that was not the question. It was who was going to join Netanyahu in the coalition."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Netanyahu made a rare, unpublicised campaign stop on Monday at Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A giant rotating campaign billboard features an image of Benjamin Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Tuesday, he gave a 35-minute interview to a small radio and television station in which he spoke mainly about Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In a sign of Mr Herzog's growing strength, Mr Netanyahu focused his attacks on Ms Livni, who is less popular, and who, under the Zionist Union agreement, would rotate the premiership with Mr Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Anyone who stays home is ensuring that Tzipi Livni, who is a candidate for prime minister, will be prime minister," Mr Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He also dismissed talk of uniting in a coalition with Zionist Union, which he said "contains activist elements that can only be called anti-Zionist".</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Great God almighty, how can two such pieces be glued together: the Likud, which is such a national, liberal, Zionist movement, with such elements?" he asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Such a government would fall apart before it is formed. There are two options: either a paralysis government or worse, Tzipi Livni living on Balfour Street and running the country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mr Herzog provided the response, saying on Israel Radio's noon magazine that "Netanyahu is feeling pressured" and "shooting in all directions, making false accusations".</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Zionist Union has hardly mentioned the rotation agreement with Ms Livni since its formation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Mr Herzog kept the focus on himself on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"I will replace him and I will form the next government," Mr Herzog said on the radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>At his own campaign event on Monday evening in the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva, Mr Herzog more frequently used the plural pronoun "we", referring not just to Ms Livni but to the designated candidates to lead the defence and finance ministries, who joined him on stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"We're the only alternative to the regime", he told a group of about 150 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"We have answers that are complete and to the point. We will do everything to unite the nation and not break it up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>As he has throughout the campaign, Mr Herzog declined to answer a voter's question of whether he would consider a unity government with the Likud, explaining that he had learnt in politics "never to say no in advance".</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"I want to make it clear: I'm here to beat Netanyahu and send him home," Mr Herzog said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"If we are big enough," he added in an attempt to pull people away from other centre-left parties, "then we'll be able to put together a normal coalition."</td></tr>
