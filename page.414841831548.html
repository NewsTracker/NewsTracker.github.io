<h3>Government: Radical militants kill 4 Tunisian National Guard</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ministry spokesman Mohammed Ali Aroui said 20 militants from the Oqba Ibn Nafaa radical group ambushed a night patrol around 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Kasserine city around midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Our response will be strong and violent," he said, adding that a sweep of the area was underway to catch the attackers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The attack took place near Mount Chaambi, a national park on the Algerian border that has provided refuge to al-Qaida linked Islamist radicals blamed for attacks against army and politicians in Tunisia for the past two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The attack comes as Tunisian forces on the Libyan border are on high alert in the wake of the murder of 21 Egyptian Christians in Libya by another radical Islamic group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Since Tunisians overthrew their secular dictator in 2011, kicking off the region-wide Arab Spring, they have come increasingly under attack by Islamic militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Despite the efforts of Tunisia's small army, attacks have continued around Mount Chaambi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Oqba bin Nafaa group describes itself as the military wing of Ansar al-Sharia, whose leaders fled to Libya in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They have been implicated in the murder two politicians in 2013, the massacre of 15 soldiers last July and an attack on the home of the former interior minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Aroui said the attack must be in revenge for a series of police operations against jihadi "sleeper cells" that have resulted in the arrest of dozens of suspected militant supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In one sweep earlier this month, 32 suspects were arrested for planning attacks on the Interior Ministry and National Guard bases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Algerian and Tunisian forces are attempting to coordinate their efforts to control the rugged region, which straddles the border between the two countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Monday, Algerian forces killed a militant carrying explosives near Tebessa, just across the border from Kasserine.</td></tr>

<h3>Afghan conflict claims most civilians' lives since 2009</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The report blamed most casualties on the Taliban, which it said used explosives in residential areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The number of civilians killed or wounded in the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan rose by 22 percent in 2014 to climb to the highest level in five years as NATO troops ended their combat mission, according to a UN report released Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The appalling levels of violence in Afghanistan in 2014 should not be repeated in 2015," said Nicholas Haysom, chief of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>UNAMA found that 10,548 civilian casualties, including 3,699 deaths, occurred in 2014, mostly as a result of ground fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Deaths and injuries from ground warfare surged by 54 percent, which the report chalked up to the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) by the Taliban - often placed indiscriminately in residential areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The report also put some blame on the mortars, rockets and grenades used by government forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"In communities across Afghanistan, increased ground fighting among parties and more (improvised explosive device) attacks exacted a heavy toll on Afghan civilians," Haysom said, adding that the Taliban and other insurgents should "abide by their public commitments to avoid civilian casualties."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The report gives responsibility for 72 percent of the casualties to the Taliban, with government forces and foreign troops responsible for 14 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The remaining casualties could not be clearly attributed to either side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Taliban members disputed these figures and have repeatedly stated their desire to limit the loss of civilian life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On top of recommending the Taliban cease using IEDs, UNAMA also suggested Kabul could reduce civilian victims of the war by disbanding government militias and holding responsible those members accused of carrying out human rights abuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The UN also underscored the dire social and economic consequences of civilian losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>If a man is injured or killed, he leaves his wife as the sole breadwinner of the family, often forcing families to marry off their daughters or send children to work instead of school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"For Afghan women and children, the anguish of losing a husband and father in the conflict is often only the beginning of their suffering and hardship," said UNAMA Director of Human Rights Georgette Gagnon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The security situation in Afghanistan remains volatile, as civilian casualties are on the rise and the peace process between the Afghan government and the Taliban is quite shaky, says a recent United Nations report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As Afghan President Ashraf Ghani prepares for his first official US visit, a host of key issues will be on the agenda, including the US troop exit, prospective Taliban peace talks, and the Afghan economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>DW examines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>While Kabul's efforts to prevent the torture of detainees have shown some progress, much more remains to be done, especially as there is a "persistent lack of accountability," UNAMA's Georgette Gagnon tells DW.</td></tr>
