<h3>Crash pilot locked out of cockpit: report</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>One of the two pilots on the doomed Germanwings flight was apparently locked out of the cockpit before the plane crashed in the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cockpit recordings recovered from the crash site indicated one of the seats was pushed back and the door opened and closed, followed by the sound of knocking, said a source close to the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The source said "there was no more conversation from that point until the crash".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An alarm indicating the proximity of the ground could be heard before the impact, which killed all 150 people on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The pilots had been speaking normally and in German at the start of Flight 4U9525.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The source could not say if it was the captain or the first officer who had left the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The cockpit voice recorder was found late on Tuesday, several hours after the crash of the budget flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf, and the data analysed on Wednesday afternoon.</td></tr>
