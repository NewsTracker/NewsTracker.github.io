<h3>Jerry Warren, former White House press secretary, dies at 84</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He was 84.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Warren died Friday at a hospital in Arlington, Virginia, after entering hospice care for cancer and pneumonia, U-T San Diego reported (http://bit.ly/19FBBcH).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Warren was assistant managing editor of The San Diego Union in 1969 when President-elect Richard Nixon hired him as deputy press secretary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He served through Richard Nixon's resignation and into the presidency of Gerald Ford until 1975.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He returned to journalism, becoming editor of The San Diego Union and later the merged publication San Diego Union-Tribune until 1995.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Warren's daughter said he devoted his final years to his faith.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He earned a master's degree in theology and led a four-year ministry education program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He was searching for a closer relationship to God, and his faith was increasingly important to him," his daughter, Euphemia "Mia" Johnson, told U-T San Diego.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Warren was born in Hastings, Nebraska, on Aug. 17, 1930.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After graduating with a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Nebraska, he went on to serve four years as a naval aviator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Later, he settled in San Diego, working his way into a career as a reporter and editor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He understood copy," said Peter Kaye, then a Union reporter, told U-T San Diego, "and best of all he got along very well with reporters and people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Leaving the paper for Washington, D.C., Warren thrived in the city's hothouse atmosphere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Euphemia Davis, Warren's first wife, recalled how a red telephone installed at the family's home "rang at all hours of the day and night."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He traveled with Nixon to China, attended French President Charles de Gaulle's funeral in Paris, and flew home from the Soviet Union with genuine Russian vodka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Yet serving during the Nixon administration also took a heavy toll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"To live through the intense two years of Watergate," Euphemia Davis said, "he had to maintain an absolute belief that the president did not know, that it had to be his underlings who had done this. If he thought otherwise, he would lose his internal compass."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In the end, though, even Warren could not deny the president's guilt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"To find out that he had been used that way," Davis said, "it was devastating to him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He returned to journalism in 1975 as editor of the San Diego Union, overseeing the paper through its merger with the Evening Tribune.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>When he stepped down in 1995, he described his career in journalism as "a great ride."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Warren moved with his second wife, Viviane Pratt, to Middleburg, Virginia, and devoted much of his time to the Episcopal Church.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The fact that he worked for two presidents is sort of what makes him known," Johnson, his daughter, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Dad would say that his later life, with his connections to his faith and learning, are what he is most proud of."</td></tr>

<h3>With Obama on hand, Princeton beats Green Bay 80-70 in NCAAs (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- It's not that Princeton coach Courtney Banghart was unimpressed to see President Barack Obama in the stands, just a few rows away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It's that Banghart was more concerned with making sure her Tigers - including Obama's niece, a freshman forward - would stay unbeaten and win a women's NCAA Tournament game for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After trailing at halftime with the First Fan in attendance Saturday, eighth-seeded Princeton came back to improve to 31-0, beating No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>9 seed Wisconsin-Green Bay 80-70 behind Michelle Miller's 20 points, Annie Tarakchian's 19, and a 49-22 rebounding edge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''He was actually sitting right in front of my family, so I'd look back at my family, and I'd be like, 'Oh, my God.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It's Barack.' But it certainly wasn't in my focus,'' Banghart said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''And that's not belittling his importance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That will go down as a highlight, as well, and I'm hoping there's a picture of me - and he's somewhere in the background,'' she continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There was some question whether Ivy League champion Princeton deserved a better seeding, given that it was the only undefeated women's team and was ranked 13th in the final AP poll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the Tigers came in 0-4 in the NCAAs, all since 2010; indeed, Ivy League teams were 1-22 before Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''My NCAA Tournament record is atrocious,'' Banghart said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Coming now is by far the biggest challenge Princeton has faced all season: a game against No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>1 seed Maryland on the Terrapins' home floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Maryland advanced Saturday by beating 16th-seeded New Mexico State 75-57.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Against Green Bay (28-5), Princeton fell behind by three points late in the first half and was down 35-34 at halftime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Princeton is not accustomed to losing and it's not all that familiar with close calls, either, having won all but two of its games by at least 10 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>As for Princeton's mental state heading into the second half, guard Blake Dietrick said, ''We came out with an attitude of, 'OK, we got our feet wet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>We know we're in this game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>We know we can win this game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And just like that, Princeton used a 15-3 run to lead 60-48 with about 9 minutes left on Alex Wheatley's fastbreak layup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mehryn Kraker led Green Bay with 21 points, and Kaili Lukan added 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But the Phoenix shot just 8 of 27 on 3-pointers, while Princeton went 9 of 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Obama's niece, freshman forward Leslie Robinson, did not appear in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The cheerer-in-chief arrived a few minutes before tipoff, taking a seat among orange-wearing Princeton fans not far off the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Police cars dotted roads leading to the arena, and there was heavy security at entrances, including metal detectors and bomb-sniffing dogs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''I shook his hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>And I got a picture,'' Green Bay coach Kevin Borseth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''Well, the President came.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>During the second half, a brief chant of ''Four more years!'' rose from some spectators, drawing a chuckle from Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Just like when any player's uncle shows up for a tournament game, right?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>First lady Michelle Obama went to Princeton, as did her brother, Craig Robinson, who is Leslie's father and sat next to the President on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Showing family favoritism, President Obama picked Princeton to make it to the Final Four in his women's NCAA bracket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Tarakchian had 17 rebounds, Wheatley had 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>''When I came on the court and looked at them, I just saw the size of 'em,'' Borseth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Princeton: The only other Ivy League team to win a women's NCAA Tournament game was Harvard in 1998, when it became the only 16th seed to upset a No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>1 by beating Stanford.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Green Bay: Finished with only seven turnovers, but was outscored 21-8 at the foul line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Princeton: Will face Maryland on Monday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The Terrapins are on a 25-game winning streak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Green Bay: Season over.</td></tr>
