<h3>NYC's plan to allow prayer breaks in pre-kindergarten classes raises church-state concerns</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The controversy comes as Mayor Bill de Blasio aims to expand his signature initiative to offer full-day pre-K classes for every 4-year-old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The plan depends in part on the participation of Jewish, Christian and Muslim schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Starting next September, pre-K classes will be permitted to break in the middle of the day for "non-program" activities such as prayer.</td></tr>
