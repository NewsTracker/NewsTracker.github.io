<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BENGHAZI, Libya, April 27 (Reuters) - Islamic State militants have slit the throats of five journalists working for a Libyan TV station in the eastern part of the country, an army commander said on Monday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>Their route took them through Derna, a militant Islamist hotspot.</td></tr>
