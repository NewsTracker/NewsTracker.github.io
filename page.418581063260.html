<tr><td>5</td><td>(AP) -- NASCAR driver Kurt Busch's ex-girlfriend has resigned from the military charity that she headed amid an investigation of her finances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A spokesman for the Armed Forces Foundation said Thursday that Patricia Driscoll tendered her resignation Tuesday night after 12 years as president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The foundation posted a statement on its website thanking Driscoll for her work but not explaining the reason for her resignation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The site also includes a statement from Driscoll, who said she was proud of what the group achieved under her tenure but also offered no explanation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Driscoll, who accused Busch of assaulting her last year at Dover International Speedway, hung up on a reporter when contacted by telephone Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She did not respond to a later email seeking an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dan Hill, an outside spokesman for the foundation, said the charity is conducting an internal investigation into published reports alleging that Driscoll used foundation funds for her personal expenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''We take it seriously, and the foundation is committed to its mission,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Hill said the investigation is being led by the Washington, D.C., law firm of Wiley Rein and will examine the foundation's policies and practices, finances, audits, and filings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''It's going to be exhaustive,'' said Hill, who did not know when the investigation would be completed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In a year-end financial statement for 2013, the tax-exempt nonprofit listed revenues and expenses of more than $14 million, including almost $12.5 million in ''volunteer'' and ''in-kind'' expenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The foundation says its mission is to promote the morale and welfare of active duty, reserve and retired military personnel and their families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It is a fixture on the NASCAR racing circuit, and Busch formerly served as a ''celebrity ambassador'' for the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>After Driscoll accused Busch of assaulting her following their breakup, a Delaware Family Court commissioner granted her request for a protective order requiring Busch to stay away from her, but law enforcement officials said there was not enough evidence to bring criminal charges against Busch.</td></tr>
