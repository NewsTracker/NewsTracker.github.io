<h3>Rangers 4, Predators 1: Rangers? Mats Zuccarello Gets New Deal, Then Gives Signature Effort</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Rangers veteran Mats Zuccarello, a crafty wing with a new four-year, $18 million contract, went out and played the type of game his teammates had come to expect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Zuccarello assisted on Marc Staal's opening goal 6 minutes 36 seconds into the first period and then whipped a picturesque centering pass from the right boards to Chris Kreider, who made the score 2-0 early in the second with his 17th goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"A player is only as good as his teammates, and I have a lot of help here," Zuccarello said after his linemates Rick Nash and Derick Brassard turned in a strong performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This feels like home. It feels nice to be able to win with this team. I'm really excited."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nash and Dominic Moore scored third-period goals for the Rangers (39-17-6), who won for the 13th time in their last 17 games at the Garden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nash's goal, his 38th, was an empty-netter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cam Talbot continued his strong play starting in place of the injured Henrik Lundqvist, making 25 saves against the highflying Predators as the Rangers moved back into a first-place tie with the Islanders in the Eastern Conference's Metropolitan Division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The former Ranger Matt Cullen scored for Nashville (41-16-7) late in the second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Predators have a three-game losing streak for the first time this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Rangers General Manager Glen Sather made a rare appearance after the team's newest member, defenseman Keith Yandle, met with reporters while wearing a No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>93 Rangers sweater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After commending Yandle's prowess at both ends of the ice, Sather joked that Zuccarello's contract was done except for the "blood or ink" to make it official.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Agents are always trying to get all the blood that you have," Sather added with a grin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The addition of the offensively gifted Yandle to a corps of defensemen that includes the playoff-tested Dan Girardi, Staal, Ryan McDonagh, Kevin Klein and Dan Boyle should give the Rangers a boost as the playoffs approach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I'm just here to play," Yandle, a 28-year-old Boston native, said, adding that he was delighted to be reunited with the former Coyotes assistant coach Ulf Samuelsson, now a Rangers assistant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's special, a real honor."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Yandle, who started and was mostly paired with Klein, said he was "ecstatic" to learn he had been traded from the bottom-feeding Coyotes to the Rangers, Stanley Cup finalists a season ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He figures to improve the team's power play, having recorded more man-advantage points since the start of the 2009-10 season than any other N.H.L. defenseman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The smooth-skating Yandle had a quiet debut, though, contributing three shots on goal in 19:41 of ice time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I had a little bit of butterflies, and I was nervous a little bit just being on a new team," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The coaches did a great job helping me out in the little time we had before the game, getting me familiar with the system. It's going to be become more and more fluid."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Zuccarello, who had given every impression that he wanted to remain a Ranger despite the allure of the open market, was greeted with cheers from a crowd relieved that one of its favorites had not been traded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He is 5 feet 7 inches and exhibits a mix of speed, smarts and skill that has cemented his popularity, especially among younger fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He led the Rangers last season with 59 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Any notion that he would have been traded was dismissed by Sather, who has been at the Rangers' helm since 2000 after winning five Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I like everything about him - his tenacity, his hard work, the way he sees the ice and the chemistry he brings to the dressing room," Sather said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"He's been a terrific player for us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Zuccarello, who could have been a free agent this summer, helps generate results for Nash and Brassard, a playmaking center who had two assists against the Predators to increase his team-best total to 37.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Now all three have long-term contracts on a Rangers squad that could further improve once Lundqvist, who turned 33 on Monday, returns from a vascular injury in the throat area that has forced him to miss the past month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"We're like a family here," said Zuccarello, 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"And this was a strong game for us. Get the 2 points and stay four more years - this day can't be much better."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Sather conceded that the price for Yandle, who helped the Coyotes reach the Western Conference finals in 2012, was steep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The Rangers parted with the prized teenage forward Anthony Duclair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"You have to give to get," Sather said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"It was a calculated risk we felt was well worth it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The Rangers are 14-3-5 against Western Conference opponents this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>... Rangers defenseman Dan Boyle, 38, played the 999th game of his N.H.L. career.</td></tr>
