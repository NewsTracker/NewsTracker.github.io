<h3>‘Glee’ star Matthew Morrison works tirelessly to drive overbearing ‘Finding Neverland’</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Matthew Morrison and Kelsey Grammer in "Finding Neverland."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Forget that "Finding Neverland" is set in 1904 London and that Kelsey Grammer plays a theater producer rather than a pedantic shrink: The show muscles in a "Cheers" joke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Surprisingly, there's no riff on singing at regionals, even though this new musical also stars Matthew Morrison, a Mr. Will Schuester of "Glee."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That's pretty much the only sign of restraint in this overstuffed production, which opened on Broadway Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>You know a show leaves nothing to chance when it features children, a dog and a nifty visual effect requiring what's billed as an "air sculptor."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Holding it all together is Morrison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sporting a beard and Scottish burr, he's tireless, if not especially charismatic, as J.M. Barrie, the writer who created Peter Pan - a role played by Johnny Depp in the film from which this musical springs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Here, Barrie's a married, successful playwright with an overbearing American producer, Charles Frohman (Grammer), who keeps asking for more of the same stories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This frustrates Barrie, until a chance meeting with four rambunctious young brothers inspires him to write down an idea he'd been nursing for a while, of a place called Neverland, where boys never grow up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>You've got to hand it to Harvey Weinstein, producer behind both the film and the show: He loosened the purse strings and hired the Tony-winning director Diane Paulus ("Pippin," "Hair"), choreographer Mia Michaels ("So You Think You Can Dance") and Gary Barlow (of the UK boy band Take That) and Eliot Kennedy for the score.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That last, which matters since we're talking about a musical, is simply serviceable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Barlow and Kennedy dutifully deliver the obligatory power ballads - mostly for Laura Michelle Kelly as the boys' widowed mother (and Barrie's chaste love interest) - but their heart is in the faster, livelier ensemble songs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Believe," for instance, proudly bears its 1960s pop influence, drawing from The Beatles and the Zombies in a very British way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Too bad Michaels' choreography has all the zest of vintage MTV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>What's most striking is how a show about the power of whimsy and imagination is so lacking in both.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Paulus and Company don't trust intimacy and charm, so everything is overplayed - despite the advice to an actor rehearsing Barrie's "Peter Pan" to go "smaller."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Peter Pan taught others to free themselves and fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>For most of its running time, "Finding Neverland" remains stuck to the ground.</td></tr>
