<tr><td>20</td><td>His remarks came before the Blazer transcript was released in New York.</td></tr>

<tr><td>34</td><td>The race to succeed Blatter has started, with former France soccer great Michel Plantini at the top of many lists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Platini, the president of European governing body UEFA, has also been keeping a low profile since Blatter's announcement, but he is expected to speak in the coming days in Berlin, where he will attend Saturday's Champions League final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Another possible replacement is Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein of Jordan, who lost to Blatter 133-73 in Friday's election.</td></tr>

<tr><td>44</td><td>At least a couple hundred people were present when Warner spoke, many of them having not seen the televised remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Warner said he has documents and checks that link FIFA officials, including embattled President Sepp Blatter, to the 2010 election in Trinidad and Tobago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"I apologize for not disclosing my knowledge of these events before," Warner said.</td></tr>
