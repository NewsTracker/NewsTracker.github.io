<h3>Saddam's tomb suffers extensive damage in clashes between Iraqi forces, ISIS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OUJA, Iraq -- The tomb of Iraq's late dictator Saddam Hussein was virtually levelled in heavy clashes between militants from the Islamic State group and Iraqi forces in a fight for control of the city of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fighting intensified to the north and south of Saddam Hussein's hometown Sunday as Iraqi security forces vowed to reach the centre of Tikrit within 48 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Associated Press video from the village of Ouja, just south of Tikrit, shows all that remains of Hussein's once-lavish tomb are the support columns that held up the roof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Poster-sized pictures of Saddam, which once covered the mausoleum, are now nowhere to be seen amid the mountains of concrete rubble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Instead, Shiite militia flags and photos of militia leaders mark the predominantly Sunni village, including that of Maj.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the powerful Iranian general advising Iraqi Shiite militias on the battlefield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This is one of the areas where IS militants massed the most because Saddam's grave is here," said Captain Yasser Nu'ma, an official with the Shiite militias, formerly known as the Popular Mobilization Forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The IS militants' set an ambush for us by planting bombs around" the tomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The extremist Islamic State group has controlled Tikrit since June, when it waged its lightning offensive that saw Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, come under their control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Islamic State was helped in its conquest of northern Iraq by Saddam loyalists, including military veterans, who appealed to Sunnis who felt victimized by Baghdad's Shiite-dominated government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Islamic State group claimed in August that Saddam's tomb had been completely destroyed, but local officials said it was just ransacked and burned, but suffered only minor damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Saddam was captured by U.S. forces in 2003 and was executed by hanging in December 2006 after an Iraqi special tribunal found him guilty of crimes against humanity for the mass killing of Shiites and Kurds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>His body has been kept in the mausoleum in his birthplace, Ouja, since 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The complex featured a marble octagon at the centre of which a bed of fresh flowers covered the place where his body was buried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The extravagant chandelier at its centre was reminiscent of the extravagant life he led until U.S. forces toppled him in 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Iraqi media reported last year that Saddam's body was removed by loyalists amid fears that it would be disturbed in the fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The body's location is not known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Recapturing Tikrit, a Sunni bastion on the Tigris River, would pave the way for an assault on Mosul, which U.S. officials have said could come as soon as next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Concerns are mounting that Iraq's Shiite militias, of which an estimated 20,000 are fighting in Tikrit, will carry out revenge attacks on this and other areas that are home to predominantly Sunni residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Amnesty International last year said the militias wear military uniforms but operate outside any legal framework and without any official oversight, adding that they are not prosecuted for their crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch echoed those concerns, calling on the Iraqi government to protect civilians in Tikrit and allow them to flee combat zones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Its statement noted "numerous atrocities" against Sunni civilians by pro-government militias and security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Shiite militants are increasingly being accused of levelling the Sunni towns they capture from the Islamic State group, making it impossible for residents to return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Tikrit has already been heavily damaged in months of violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A satellite image of Tikrit, released last month by the United Nations, observed that at least 536 buildings in the city have been affected by the fighting, with at least 137 completely destroyed and 241 severely damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Local Sunni tribal fighters have formed uneasy alliances with the Iraqi army and Shiite militias in the battle for Tikrit, which Iraqi and U.S. officials believe is essential for defeating the Sunni militant group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Yazan al-Jubouri, a Sunni from Tikrit fighting alongside the Shiite militias, said that the Islamic State militants killed 16 of his relatives and kept his family living in horror.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We want to take revenge on those IS militants who killed our children," he said.</td></tr>

<h3>Critic?s Notebook: Empac Shrugs Popularity to Promote Creative Liberty in Troy, N.Y.</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Empac Shrugs Popularity to Promote Creative Liberty in Troy, N.Y.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>TROY, N.Y. - On Saturday evening, chilly and foggy here, a small group of people stood at the edge of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute campus and gazed up at the looming facade of the Curtis R. Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Encompassing units of astronomical measurement and Italian literature is just the kind of thing that this enormous building was created for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Priem Center, known as Empac, opened in 2008 with a mission to explore the blurring boundary between the arts and sciences - both, after all, engaged in the work of experimentation and the examination of perception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>To that end Empac's four performance spaces were equipped with an impressive range of multimedia and technical capacities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Led by its director, Johannes Goebel, the center's curators have attracted artists eager for the time and resources to do work that might raise eyebrows elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some of the programming has been idiosyncratic but low-tech - Michael Gordon rehearsed and recorded his bassoon septet "Rushes"; Laurie Anderson led an onstage tai chi class - and some has been more overtly cutting edge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dancers have traced their movements with a 3-D laser scanner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr. Goebel has been part of a collaborative project focused on data visualization and virtual reality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The composer Pauline Oliveros, a professor at the school, has worked with others on developing an artificial-intelligence musician able to perform (and improvise!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>alongside a human ensemble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Interzone" (2003-4), a multimedia acoustic-electric work by the German composer Enno Poppe, which the Talea Ensemble was originally supposed to perform on Friday, would have fit in well here, with the players on a custom-built stage in the center of the 1,200-seat concert hall, surrounded by the audience and projection screens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But visa issues forced the group to substitute it with Mr. Poppe's "Speicher" (2008-13), conducted by James Baker, in its American premiere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Entirely acoustic - the sound booth, often a site of intense activity at an Empac concert, sat empty and forlorn - the 70-minute "Speicher" is really an assemblage of six pieces, played without pause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr. Goebel is obsessive about acoustics and eliminating ambient noise in Empac's halls, and one of Mr. Poppe's recurring motifs, a soft, sighing droop, registered with preternatural clarity and presence, even if just a single musician was playing it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Slithering, unsteady passages roused themselves into raucous celebrations, handled with Talea's characteristic polish and vitality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr. Poppe has a gift for imaginative orchestration: Rarely has an accordion's wheeze taken on such organlike nobility, or a celesta sounded so pearly against piercing winds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The audience numbered about 70, roughly 6 percent of capacity and low enough to give most artistic directors panic attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>(Other similarly challenging concerts here have done significantly better.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But Mr. Goebel, cushioned by sources of revenue other than customers, radiates blissful indifference to such matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>As universities become, more and more, the American institutions best equipped to fund artmaking, Empac's thoroughly academic approach may become more common, valuing exploration and incremental advancement of the field as ends in themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Talea Ensemble was given an uninterrupted week in the space, a rare opportunity to study and percolate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>If just a few dozen people showed up for the final product, should it matter?</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Well, maybe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>While Mr. Goebel cares little about ticket sales per se, he wants to entice more students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The few who showed up to "Speicher" might well have been turned off by the hall's lighting, which was kept throughout the concert at a presumably intentional full blast, creating an almost extravagantly uncomfortable listening environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Without a preconcert talk, on-stage discussion or extensive notes, the evening, for better or worse, emphasized immersion over education.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"It was a stretch for many people here," the physicist Shirley Ann Jackson, the school's president since 1999 and the visionary behind Empac, said of the center's inception in an interview in her office overlooking downtown Troy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But she said the board, faculty and students had embraced it, and initiatives aimed at fostering more interdisciplinary research projects are included in the strategy that will culminate in 2024, the school's bicentennial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Financial difficulties remain: Empac's budget has suffered from schoolwide cuts and a hiring freeze has stalled the process of appointing a new curator of theater and dance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But its resources remain formidable and its goal - creating a space for people to expand their range of experience - is inspiring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>There's even something refreshing about Mr. Goebel's distaste for easy, Facebook-style approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Asked if he wanted people to like the work he presented, he replied, with a smile: "Liking is such a feeble thing."</td></tr>
