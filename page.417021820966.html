<h3>AP Source: Hillary and Bill Clinton report earning more than $25M from speeches since Jan. '14</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON - Hillary Rodham Clinton and former President Bill Clinton reported Friday they earned more than $25 million combined in speaking fees since January 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Clinton's presidential campaign reported the income in a personal financial disclosure report filed with the Federal Election Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The report, required of every candidate for the White House, also shows Hillary Clinton earned more than $5 million from her 2014 memoirs, "Hard Choices."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The details of the report were described by a Clinton campaign official who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss a report not yet publicly available from the FEC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The report was expected to be released publicly later Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While Clinton has begun her second campaign for president by casting herself as a champion for middle-class voters, she's long draw criticism from Republicans about the wealth she and Bill Clinton have amassed since he left the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That includes their ability to command six-figure fees for delivering speeches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The finances behind the family's charitable foundation have also generated scrutiny because of its acceptances of donations from foreign governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>During last year's book tour, Clinton told an interviewer that her family was "dead broke" when they left the White House, which Republicans said showed a lack of understanding of the needs of typical families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Liberals have also questioned whether Clinton is too closely tied to Wall Street, pointing to her days representing New York in the U.S. Senate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They are also wary she might not aggressively seek to regulate the nation's financial industry and serve as an adequate bulwark against economic inequality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The campaign official said the FEC filing will show that the couple earned more than $25 million for more than 100 paid speeches between January 2014 and May 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That would represent an average fee of about $250,000 per speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The report will also list assets of between $5 million and $25 million in a mutual fund managed by Vanguard that the Clintons set up in the past year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The couple did not earn any capital gains during the period and paid an effective tax rate of more than 30 percent in the 2014 tax year, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Clinton last filed a financial disclosure report during her final year as Secretary of State in 2012, when she reported that her and her husband's wealth was estimated between $4 million and $20 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Much of that income came from the lucrative speeches and appearances made by Bill Clinton around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A recent Associated Press review of the Clintons' disclosures and State Department records found that Bill Clinton had been paid at least $50 million for his appearances between 2009 and 2012, the four years that Hillary Clinton served as the nation's top diplomat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Federal candidates are required to file personal financial disclosures within 30 days of announcing their candidacy or on May 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Several Republican candidates in the race filed a request for an extension to those deadlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Each disclosure form lists candidates' assets and liabilities, and provides a snapshot of their annual income.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But federal rules allow those figures to be reported in wide ranges instead of specific amounts - allowing candidates, for example, to report a large asset as worth between $1 million and $5 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Any income exceeding $200 has to be reported and most assets worth more than $1,000 at the end of a calendar year must be disclosed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Assets can include bank accounts, real estate, insurance plans, stock and securities holdings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Liabilities can include loans, mortgages and other debts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Annual income includes not only salaries, but also stock, securities and real estate profits, interest, book profits and speeches and other honoraria.</td></tr>
