<h3>US launches Africa military exercises amid Boko Haram threat</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Some 1,300 participants from 28 countries are joining in the Flintlock exercise that lasts until March 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It includes counter-terrorism forces not only from the U.S. but from other Western countries and a number of African militaries including several of the armies who have pledged to support Nigeria in its battle against the jihadists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The annual exercise first began in 2006 in part to counter the rise of al-Qaida-linked militants in the Sahel region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Now the most imminent danger to regional security is Boko Haram, which killed at least 10,000 people in Nigeria last year and is now staging cross-border attacks in Cameroon, Niger and Chad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We must respond to this immense security challenge, which is a major concern. You will agree that this is a difficult task, because terrorism has no face and no jurisdiction," Chadian Gen. Brahim Seid Mahamat said at an opening ceremony Monday, according to comments published by the U.S. military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>George Thiebes, commander of special operations with Command Forward-West Africa, which leads the Flintlock exercise, said one of the challenges is helping armies from different countries to work together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While the upcoming multinational force against Boko Haram is not a specific focus of Flintlock, the training is aimed at broader themes that will apply to that mission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We look at how we can get the nations to work together against a common threat," Thiebes told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Among the obstacles: Disparate radio systems, harsh terrain and finding common vocabulary even when troops speak the same language, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Chad is the host country, though other planned stations are Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon and Tunisia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Thiebes said the training is going ahead despite a recent series of Boko Haram attacks on Niger and Cameroon.</td></tr>
