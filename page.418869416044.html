<h3>Greece, rescue creditors in 2nd day of talks on new lifeline</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras arrives at Syriza party headquarters for a meeting with senior party officials in Athens, Monday, July 27, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After passing a series of reforms demanded by creditors, the Greek government is hoping that negotiations on the bailout will be completed by Aug. 20 when the country has a big debt repayment of around 3.2 billion euros ($3.5 billion) to make to the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Emissaries from Greece's international creditors are holding a second day of preparatory talks with Greek officials, ahead of higher-level negotiations later this week on the country's new multi-billion euro lifeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The aim is to thrash out the terms of the deal - worth about 85 billion euros ($94 billion) over three years - before Aug. 20, when Greece must make a debt payment that it cannot afford without new loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It will be the country's third bailout in more than five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>So far, the country has received about 240 billion euros from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
