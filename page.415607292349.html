<h3>Tiffany's Sales Fall for First Time in 5 Years on Strong Dollar</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sales outside the United States account for roughly half of Tiffany's total revenue, while tourists have historically accounted for a quarter of U.S. sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The company's Fifth Avenue store counts on tourists for about 40 percent of sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Although Tiffany has been battling the effects of a strong dollar for months, the drop in fourth-quarter sales surprised analysts, most of whom were expecting an increase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The dollar gained about 9 percent between November and January, which takes in the holiday shopping season, and it is widely expected to rise further this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tiffany, whose shares fell more than 3 percent on Friday, said sales were expected to drop 10 percent in the quarter ending April, mostly because of the dollar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Tourist purchases are expected to continue to be pressured in the Americas," Chief Financial Officer Ralph Nicoletti said on a post-earnings conference call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The company said it expects profit to fall 30 percent in the current quarter and more modestly in the second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A recovery in the next two quarters would deliver "minimal growth" in full-year profit from the $4.20 per share earned in the year ended Jan. 31.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said he doubted Tiffany would meet these targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tourists spent $34.55 billion in the United States in the November-January period, down 1.5 percent from a year earlier, according to the government's Office of Travel & Tourism Industries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tiffany's fourth-quarter revenue slipped to $1.29 billion from $1.30 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Analysts were expecting $1.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Net income was $196.2 million, or $1.51 per share, in line with the average analyst estimate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Tiffany's shares were down 3.5 percent at $83.38 on the News York Stock Exchange.</td></tr>

<h3>1st phase of Boston Marathon bombing trial winding down</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tsarnaev is charged with conspiring with his brother to place two bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line in April 2013, killing three and injuring more than 260 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BOSTON (AP) - An admission by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev that he bombed the Boston Marathon has vastly accelerated the pace of his federal death penalty trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While the trial was originally expected to last three to four months, it could be over in about half that time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prosecutors could rest their case in the guilt phase as early as next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>With a relatively brief case expected from the defense, the trial could soon move to the penalty phase, when the same jury will decide whether Tsarnaev is sentenced to death or spends the rest of his life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tsarnaev faces 30 federal charges for conspiring and carrying out twin bombings with his older brother, Tamerlan, who was killed three days later during a gunbattle with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two pressure-cooker bombs exploded within seconds of each other near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tsarnaev is also charged in the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer and a violent confrontation with police that nearly killed a transit police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>During opening statements, Tsarnaev's attorney, Judy Clarke, bluntly told the jury, "It was him," admitting her client participated in the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Clarke said Tamerlan, 26, was the mastermind who enlisted the then-19-year-old Dzhokhar to participate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Prosecutors say Dzhokhar was an active and willing participant who knowingly placed one of the bombs near a group of children, killing 8-year-old Martin Richard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Prosecutors have presented more than 70 witnesses since testimony began on March 4, including bombing survivors who lost legs, the father of Martin Richard, first responders who treated the injured, police officers and FBI agents who collected and analyzed thousands of pieces of evidence, including surveillance video and bomb components.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers did not cross-examine any of the bombing victims and have kept their questioning of other witnesses short.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Prosecutors are expected to wrap up their case in the guilt phase within a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The witness list remains sealed from public view, so it's difficult to know exactly who the remaining prosecution witnesses are.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Based on an outline of the case given by Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb in his opening statement, it appears that prosecutors will call a worker at a firing range in Manchester, New Hampshire, where both brothers practiced shooting less than a month before the marathon bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Weinreb said their shooting practice shows that both planned to use a Ruger handgun that ended up being used to kill MIT police Officer Sean Collier three days after the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Prosecutors also may call one of two college friends convicted of impeding the investigation by throwing away Dzhokhar's backpack after the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The backpack contained fireworks that had been emptied of their explosive powder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Monday, an FBI computer expert is expected to be cross-examined by defense attorneys about extremist materials found on Dzhokhar's laptop and other devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The defense case in the guilt phase is more difficult to predict, but Tsarnaev's lawyers may try to rebut testimony that appeared to show he was an active participant in Collier's shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>During opening statements, Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted much of the conduct alleged by prosecutors but said Tamerlan was the one who shot Collier, not Dzhokhar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers will present mitigating evidence they hope can save him from the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>This is expected to include testimony about the influence his older brother had on him, his home life and testimony about his childhood in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and Russia's volatile Dagestan region, which borders Chechnya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Prosecutors will present aggravating factors they hope will convince the jury that he deserves the death penalty.</td></tr>
