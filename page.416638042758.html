<h3>Apple Watch doesn't like tattoos</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple has admitted some of the functions on its new smart watch may not work properly when its worn over tattoos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Darker-coloured artwork and even changes in darker coloured skin types can fool the light sensors on the back of the watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The problem is not exclusive to the Apple Watch which performed well in independent tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But it does show the manufacturer has not solved the sensor problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Permanent or temporary changes to your skin, such as some tattoos, can .. impact heart rate sensor performance," Apple said on a support page on its website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The ink, pattern, and saturation of some tattoos can block light from the sensor, making it difficult to get reliable readings."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The watch uses green LED lights combined with light-sensitive photodiode sensors to detect the amount of blood flowing through the wrist, which can then be used to calculate heart rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Other problems have been reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Matt Siegel, a journalist for the Reuters news agency said that "the watch locks on tattooed skin and does not deliver the soft pings that alert a user to incoming messages".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The heart rate readings were also significantly different on tattooed and untattooed wrists."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Videos posted to YouTube have shown users with wrist tattoos attempting to log a work out session, only for the watch to appear to intermittently pause the stopwatch when it failed to detect the wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The problem is not unique to the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Several smart watches and wearable fitness devices that use similar sensor technology have also been reported to struggle when worn on darker coloured skin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In these cases the amount of light reflected back from deeper-coloured pigmentation of the skin is less than the device is calibrated for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The technology in Apple's watch does not appear to be of a low standard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It performed well in independent tests against leading heart rate monitors according to Consumer Reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Apple's heart rate monitor is actually a plethysmograph. It looks and acts like a pulse oximeter, but Apple isn't claiming it can measure your blood oxygen level. Why? Beats us. Our best guesses involve FDA regulations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It seems that the sensor and monitor functions of the Apple Watch are fairly advanced, but that the technology giant has yet to solve the known problems presented by darker-inked skin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We're not surprised the Apple Watch has run into problems with tattoos as it uses similar optical heart rate monitoring tech as the Fitbit Charge HR.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Apple now needs to offer users the option to disable the pin code security when the smart watch doesn't detect your wrist.</td></tr>
