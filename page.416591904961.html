<h3>Riots in Baltimore the Product of Anger, Deep Dysfunction</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Baltimore is crab cakes, the cobblestone walkways of Fells Point, a vintage baseball stadium, the retro weirdness of John Waters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cherry blossoms line the streets of its affluent neighborhoods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They call it "Charm City."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But there is another side of Baltimore that is far less charming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And on Monday, that side burned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Vast swaths of east and west Baltimore were consumed by flames and anger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The immediate trigger was the funeral of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died of a traumatic spinal injury he suffered while in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But in a startlingly segregated city struggling with failing schools, failing infrastructure, a failing economy and a police department under federal investigation, it seemed only a matter of time before this side of Baltimore boiled over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"All we have left, all many of us have left, is our dignity," said Robert Stokes, 36, as he stood with a broom and dustpan at Pennsylvania and North avenues, hours after people smashed windows, looted stores and set trash cans on fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"And when that's stripped away, what do we have left? What do we have left except for rebellion? You look around and see unemployment. Filling out job applications and being turned down because of where you live and your demographic. It's so much bigger than the police department. This place is a powder keg waiting to explode."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In some neighborhoods of inner-city Baltimore, the destruction's aftermath was near indistinguishable from any other day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In Sandtown-Winchester, where Gray was raised and arrested, whole blocks of row homes sit neglected, some scorched, others boarded up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Neglected lots overgrown with grass are littered with trash and broken glass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It wasn't always this way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Baltimore was once a prosperous city, celebrated by journalist H.L. Mencken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was a manufacturing dynamo, famed for the rye whiskey and straw hats it made, among other things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But the story of Baltimore is much the same as the rest of urban America since World War II; industry left, and fortune followed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Since the 1950s, the city's population has steadily declined, dwindling from nearly one million to 622,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The city saw growth for the first time in six decades when it gained more than 1,000 residents in 2012; the next year, the count slightly declined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The upheavals of the 1960s and '70s contributed to the disintegration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Rioting after the Rev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Martin Luther King Jr.'s death in 1968 left scars on the landscape that have never healed, and strikes by police, teachers and municipal workers in 1974 hastened the city's decline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Corruption has been a constant issue; in 2007, Mayor Sheila Dixon resigned after being convicted of embezzlement while serving as City Council president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>As droves of city residents left the city for the suburbs, thousands of Baltimore's row homes - some with castle-like spires on top - were left abandoned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Today, there are almost 17,000 vacant houses in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Meanwhile, poverty and housing remain a problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In October, the city's housing authority opened its lottery for public housing units to Baltimore residents for the first time in 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Within a week, roughly 60,000 people - about 10 percent of the city's population - had signed up.</td></tr>
