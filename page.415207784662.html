<h3>Fake soldier Franck Gervais pleads guilty to unlawfully wearing military uniform on Remembrance Day</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Franck Gervais appeared in an Ottawa court Wednesday, where he pleaded guilty to unlawfully wearing a military uniform and medals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Additional charges of impersonation will be withdrawn at his May 11 court appearance when submissions on sentencing will be made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Gervais wore a burgundy dress shirt and jeans during his brief court appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He stared straight ahead as he mumbled "guilty" to two of the four charges he faced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His wife was not in court for the plea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Franck Gervais near the War Memorial in Ottawa on Remembrance Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gervais covered his face with his jacket as his lawyer, Claude Levesque, escorted him through a throng of reporters to a vehicle waiting outside the courthouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Later, Levesque said Gervais regrets his actions and meant no disrespect to members of the military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"My client does feel remorse and apologizes for his actions," Levesque said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>According to an agreed statement of facts, Gervais was approached by a reporter at the National War Memorial for an interview because he was wearing a Canadian Armed Forces dress uniform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He also wore a medal of bravery, a special service medal, a Canadian peacekeeping medal, a NATO medal for Kosovo and a Canadian Forces decoration for 12 years of service, court heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gervais identified himself to the reporter as a sergeant and the interview was broadcast on national television a few minutes later, court heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"(The reporter) told him it would occur within the next few minutes, giving Gervais the opportunity to change his mind," according to the facts read into court by Mark Moors, an assistant crown attorney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Members of the Canadian Forces quickly noticed problems with his attire and the medals he was wearing, prompting a flurry of scrutiny and eventually the criminal charges against Gervais, who lives in Cantley, Que., just north of Ottawa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The police investigation revealed that Gervais had never been employed by the military, although he had been a cadet for several years in the 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Police also discovered that Gervais was still in uniform after the Remembrance Day ceremony when he and his wife went to the Canadian War Museum to hear author Rod McLeod promote his book called Vigil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>McLeod and a reservist chatted with Gervais for about 20 minutes about the fake soldier's struggles in the Royal Canadian Regiment due to "language barriers," court heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He also shared stories about being a paratrooper and how he earned the medal of bravery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"All of these stories are untrue," the agreed statement of facts said.</td></tr>
