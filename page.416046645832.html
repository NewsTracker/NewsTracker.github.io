<h3>Greece's claim for war reparations from Germany explained</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece has revealed that it is seeking almost 279 billion euros in reparations for the Nazi occupation of the country during the Second World War, in a move that is straining relations with Berlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Athens, along with private citizens, has pushed for war damages from Germany for decades, but the Greek government has never officially quantified its reparation claims before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' government is now seeking to claim the reparations, as well as the repayment of a so-called occupation loan, which Nazi Germany is said to have forced the Bank of Greece to make.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The first argument relates to compensation for war crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>During World War II, Germany and Italy conquered Greece in the spring of 1941.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In addition to military casualties, around 20,000 civilians (exact numbers are fiercely disputed) were killed and whole villages where destroyed by the German troops - the massacres at Kalavryta and Distomo are particularly notorious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The second part of the claims relate to direct and indirect financial costs suffered by Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At the time of the war, the Hague Convention, in place since since 1907, accepted that the occupied state should pay for living expenses and maintenance of occupying troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However the Greek treasury was subjected to costs of 476 million reichsmarks, higher even than the maximum previously agreed by the Axis powers of Germany and Italy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The enslaved Greek government had no choice but to hand over the cash which was used to fund Nazi campaigns in north Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After the defeat of the Nazis, the Paris Peace Treaties of 1946 defined the war reparations that the various countries involved would have to pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greece received $105 million from Italy (slightly more than the Soviet Union) and $45 million from Bulgaria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Germany did not conclude such a peace treaty before 1990, since it had been split in two - West and East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Nevertheless, the Paris Compensation Agreement established that Greece should receive 2.7% of total cash compensation paid by Germany and 4.35% of the transport industry, ships or other payment in kind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In effect this allocated $7.1 million at 1938 market value, around half of what Greece had demanded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In February 1953 another pact, known as the London Agreement, was signed, which covered the general debts of defeated Germany to the winners - the Allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The prewar German debt was cut by about 50% and the time (West) Germany had available to repay was extended to 30 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As for the the actual war debt, this was determined separately for each country (usually there was an agreement for a 50% cut but there were exceptions, for example the "moral" debts of Germany to Israel were not reduced at all).</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After 1953, West Germany came to various agreements with individual states to pay additional compensation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In 1960 Germany agreed with Greece to pay 115 million DM to Greek individuals who were victims of the German occupation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In total, Germany has paid around 72 billion euros in war reparations, according to Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Greece's Deputy Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas said on 6 April 2015 that Germany owes Greece almost 278.7 billion euros in reparations, according to calculations by the country's General Accounting Office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The occupation loan amounts to 10.3 billion euros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mardas was speaking at a parliamentary committee, after a parliamentary panel set up by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had started work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The campaign for compensation has gained momentum in the past few years as Greeks have suffered hardship under austerity measures imposed by the European Union and International Monetary Fund - in exchange for bailouts totalling 240 billion euros, to save Greece from bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Tsipras has frequently blamed Berlin for the hardship stemming from the imposition of austerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He has angered Berlin by threatening to push for reparations in the middle of talks to unlock aid for Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Germany is most exposed to Greece's debt, followed by France and Italy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Germany has repeatedly rejected Greece's claims and says it has honoured its obligations, including a 115 million deutschmark payment to Greece in 1960.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The London debt agreement deferred settlement of the reparations question including the repayment of war debts and contributions imposed by Germany during the war to a conference to be held after unification.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But this conference never took place and the Germans have steadfastly refused to reopen the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Instead, a so-called 2+4 Agreement was concluded, which settled the renunciation of reparations claims, but only with the four Great Powers (Britain, Russia, the US and France) among the former Allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>This 2+4 Agreement could be seen to have superceded the London Agreement and reopened possibilities for states and individuals to revive claims which were put aside in 1953.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>However, Germany insists that Greece did not raise this interpretation at the time and accepted that the issues were closed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Berlin also claims that, 70 years after the war, any such claims have long-since "lost their justificatory basis."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>On the other hand, Greeks say that their requirements are inalienable and exist no matter the time has passed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The Greeks say that they never gave up their legitimate rights to these reparations.</td></tr>
