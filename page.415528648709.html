<h3>The views of Israelis voting in Tuesday's election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nearly six million people are eligible to vote, with turnout expected to be slightly over 60 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Polls close at 10 pm (2000 GMT) on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Following are comments from ordinary Israelis who were heading to the ballot box or had just voted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu's main challenger is Isaac Herzog, the leader of the Zionist Union, who is partnered by Tzipi Livni, a former justice minister and peace negotiator with the Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Other leading candidates are Naftali Bennett of the far-right Jewish Home party; Moshe Kahlon of the centrist Kulanu; Yair Lapid of the centrist, secular Yesh Atid party; and Avigdor Lieberman of the ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I care less about Netanyahu's prospects than I do about the safety of Israel. I hear the fighting next door and I'm aware of the dangers facing us. In Bennett I see real leadership and a plan."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I'm voting for the right but am in a dilemma over which party. I'm not keen on Netanyahu's conduct, his arrogance, but on the other hand, I don't inadvertently want to help bring a left-wing government to power."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"For the first time in my life, I'm going to be voting Labour, that is the Zionist Union. Previously I voted for centrist parties, but now the risk of Netanyahu building the next government is too big. How long has he been in power? Nine years? It's too much. Enough."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Yuval Weisler, 27, an engineering student, said he voted Yesh Atid, as he has done before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I think Lapid has the right approach to economic policy, I like the way he's helped the middle class, and I'm worried what would happen if the right-wing grows stronger than the centre bloc."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I'm expecting the left to win, and it's important to balance that out with a party that's more centrist."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I voted Lapid because we need to reinforce the centre-left bloc. There are a lot of extremists in Israel, Bibi is way too extremely right-wing, so is Bennett. And I think Herzog is too far left."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Gali Shacham, 66, a retired local government worker from Kfar Tavor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Last time I voted for Lapid, and before that, Kadima. This time I chose Emet (Herzog)."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We have but one country and I can't stand Bibi anymore. He's shutting off the only lifeline Israel has to the outside world - our friendship with America."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I'm a Likud voter. There's nobody better than Netanyahu, nobody stronger."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I'm a right-winger, and Likud is the house I grew up in so I voted for Bibi, he's the best spokesman Israel has."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She says her views are more akin to Jewish Home though, and the reason she stuck by Likud is "I'm worried Bibi is going to lose."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Stav Mizrahi, 29, a physical education teacher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Says she voted from Herzog, having voted for Lapid last time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We must change the government, and Herzog needs more mandates. Bibi isn't leading us in the right direction, neither diplomatically or economically."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Moshe Goldring, 69, a physician from Kfar Tavor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Has always voted for the far-left Meretz party, and same this time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We need their influence. Labour has taken on Livni and she's a Likudnik at heart."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Netanyahu is the worst thing that ever happened to Israel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"We need to make peace with the Palestinians, without that we will never have security. I worry that my grandchildren will have to fight another war unless we finally take steps for peace."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Lily Goldring, 62, psychiatrist, Kfar Tavor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Voted for Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"I like Livni, her voice isn't heard enough."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"The main thing is we don't want Netanyahu to win. We need peace so we can all just live together equally."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Shira Mor, 35, a social worker from Herzliya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I voted Meretz because of their social platform, they are a very socially minded party looking out for the rights of minorities. I wouldn't want them as prime minister but it would be good to have a far-left party in government to balance out the other sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"I debated between voting for the Zionist Union, or what I call a 'not Bibi' vote, and Meretz, and in the end I went with my heart. But if Bibi is reelected then my heart will have a very heavy conscience."</td></tr>
