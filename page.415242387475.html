<h3>Families blocked from seeing Bali nine pair on execution island</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bali nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have spent three lonely days at Nusakambangan, with their families so far blocked from visiting them on the penal island where Indonesia's government plans to execute them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Refusing to show any latitude to the emotionally battered families, Indonesian officials are saying they can only see the pair between 9am and 1pm on Mondays and Wednesdays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Australian consular staff are negotiating for some leniency but the head of the Central Java justice office, Mirza Zukarnain, said there could be no compromise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An anti-drugs protester in Cilacap prays in front of an effigy of a drug smuggler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"No exception. We can't make allowances for certain families only. It won't be fair for the others," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The standoff comes as Indonesian President Joko Widodo insisted there were "no problems" with its relationship with Australia, despite outrage at the extraordinary military and police operation to transfer the reformed drug smugglers to Nusakambagan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are still good friends, good neighbours but the death penalty is our legal sovereignty," Mr Joko told reporters in East Java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Julian McMahon and Australian consul-general Majell Hind board the ferry at Wijaya Pura port in Cilacap headed for Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop described the "disproportionate" transfer of Chan and Sukumaran and the release of photos showing them with a smiling Bali police chief as "undignified and degrading" on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It seems that our citizens have been singled out for treatment designed to maximise publicity that was certainly at odds with the treatment of other citizens of other countries in the same position," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dozens of heavily armed police and military personnel accompanied Chan and Sukumaran during the transfer, while hundreds more secured roads and airports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sukhoi fighters jets shadowed the plane that carried them from Bali to Central Java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Other drug felons due to be executed were transferred in a far more low key fashion, often in just a single prison van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A spokesman for the Indonesian attorney general, Tony Spontana, defended the militarised operation, saying it was required "to ensure a smooth transfer".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Foreign Affairs deputy secretary Greg Moriarty, who was Australia's ambassador in Jakarta until last year, spoke with ambassador Nadjib Riphat Kesoema on Thursday night to register Australia's displeasure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ms Bishop intends to meet with the ambassador next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran are being held in isolation cells on Besi prison, or Iron prison, one of seven jails on Nusakambagan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They are incarcerated in separate cells but can call out to each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They have no contact with other inmates at the prison other than Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, who is also due to be executed by firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Friday morning, the men's lawyer, Julian McMahon, and Australia's consul-general to Bali, Majell Hind, pushed through a frenzied media mob and anti-drugs protesters to board the ferry to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Demonstrators carried a grisly post wrapped in sheets with a face scrawled with coloured pen, to resemble a corpse wrapped in a traditional Muslim shroud for burial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The demonstrators urged that the Australians be shot, carried signs such as "We love Indonesia. Save Indonesia generation" and "Go to hell".</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>They marched to the ferry dock singing the Indonesian national anthem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The scenes came as Indonesia flagged a delay in the execution of Chan, Sukumaran and eight others slated to be killed alongside them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The length of the delay remains uncertain, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The pause should give the Bali nine duo's lawyers time to pursue a legal appeal lodged on Monday with the state administrative court in Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The action is the second attempt to challenge the rejection of Bali nine drug smugglers clemency pleas by Mr Joko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Lawyers for the pair say Mr Joko rebuffed Chan and Sukumaran's petition for mercy without properly considering their specific circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>With the guidance of prison staff, the pair transformed Kerobokan penitentiary in Bali into a model of rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>On December 9 last year, Mr Joko said: "The clemency requests are not on my table yet. But I guarantee that there will be no clemency for convicts who committed narcotics-related crimes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mr Spontana, said "we have to respect the ongoing legal process", a reversal of the position of the attorney-general HM Prasetyo elucidated as recently as Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He has maintained repeatedly that a rejection of a clemency application nullified any future legal redress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>All of the ten drug offenders due to be executed have seen their pleas for clemency rejected by Mr Joko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Even so, five of the condemned 10 have legal appeals in the works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>One of the death row drug felons, Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, had her case before the courts on Tuesday before it was adjourned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It was not immediately unclear if Mr Spontana was talking about all the legal appeals or just the Veloso matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Confusion, contradiction and delay have been a regular feature of Indonesia's handling of the executions in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"There could be other reasons for the delay [but] I hope, in my heart, that it's a change of mind," Ms Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Retno Marsudi, stressed on Friday that Indonesia was determined to "maintain good relationship with Australia, with all countries".</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>She said a United Nations account of a human rights dialogue quoting Indonesian diplomats saying that the country could introduce a moratorium on the death penalty was a misrepresentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"We protested because we never stated it and the uploaded version from the Office of the UN Human Rights High Commissioner has been revised in accordance to what was stated by the Indonesian delegation," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>At the time of writing, the UN had not changed the document.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Ms Retno also insisted that the Indonesian ambassador in Canberra had not been called in to DFAT for a rebuke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Bali police spokesman Hery Wiyanto has revealed that an investigation will be launched into the media leak of a photo of a smiling Denpasar police chief with his arm on Chan's shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Mr Hery said Senior Commissioner Djoko Hari Utomo did not violate any rules and would not be investigated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"It wasn't a selfie moment, it wasn't a pose," Mr Hery said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"He was talking to and encouraging the boys."</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>However, he said intelligence officers and the internal affairs division of the police force were investigating who took the photo and how it reached the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Disciplinary action would be taken if the investigation discovered the photo had been sold to the media.</td></tr>

<h3>Tokyo?s Setagaya Ward to mull recognition of same-sex unions: mayor</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"I hope to realize what is possible within my authority as ward mayor," Nobuto Hosaka told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It's important to respect diversity in our society going forward," the mayor said, expressing hope to start official recognition of same-sex couples "as soon as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Earlier this week, Shibuya Ward submitted an ordinance to its assembly that would recognize same-sex couples as being in "relationships equivalent to marriage."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Passage of the ordinance would mark a first in Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Although legally nonbinding, such a move could eventually influence the central government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Constitution defines marriage as "based only on the mutual consent of both sexes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hosaka made the remarks after receiving a request from a Setagaya Ward assembly member who has gender identity issues, saying the ward should issue certificates to recognize gay couples.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, the mayor expressed reservations about crafting an ordinance as Shibuya Ward did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I don't think it's absolutely necessary," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gay couples in Japan often face discrimination when moving into apartments together or visiting partners in hospital, on the grounds that they are not relatives.</td></tr>
