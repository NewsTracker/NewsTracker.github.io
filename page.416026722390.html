<h3>WATCH: John Oliver grills Edward Snowden on 'Last Week Tonight'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>John Oliver and Edward Snowden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Comedian John Oliver recently scored an interview with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, stunning fans as the segment aired Sunday on HBO's "Last Week Tonight."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Oliver, who traveled to Moscow for the interview, didn't hold back, grilling Snowden on the leaked National Security Agency documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>When Oliver asked Snowden how many of the documents he had read, Snowden responded, "I do understand what I turned over."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Oliver was not impressed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There's a difference between understanding what's in the documents and reading what's in the documents ... because when you're handing over thousands of NSA documents, the last thing you'd want to do is read them," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the segment did have some lighter moments, including NSFW topics and interviews with people in New York who have no idea who Snowden is.</td></tr>
