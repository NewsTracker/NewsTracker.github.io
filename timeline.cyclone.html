<li>Meteorologists eye rare early season tropical cyclone in Pacific</li>
<li>A tropical low over the Solomon Islands may develop into another cyclone.</li>
<li>A tropical depression over the Solomon Islands is being watched closely by meteorologists and climate experts alike in case the deep low pressure system forms into a second rare early season cyclone for the region.</li>
<li>Jess Carey, a spokesman from the Bureau of Meteorology's Queensland office, said there was only about a one in five chance that the low over the islands would develop into a cyclone.</li>
<li>Conditions were not yet conducive for the low to form into a cyclone-strength storm but they might be "enhanced" over the weekend or early next week, Mr Carey said.</li>
