<li>Jonathan Nott, a professor at James Cook University and expert on cyclone history, said there has "been a lot of discussion over the last five to 10 years" about the need to extend the cyclone severity rating beyond the current maximum of five.</li>

<li>While south-east Queensland and northern NSW have been hit by big storms in the past - including the "Great Gold Coast Cyclone" of February 1954 - it is likely such events were "hybrids or intense east coast lows" rather than cyclones, he said.</li>
<li>Kevin Walsh, a cyclone expert at the University of Melbourne agreed that Cyclone Marcia was an abnormal storm.</li>
<li>Other big storms included a cyclone "very close to category 5" near Mackay in 1918 and Cyclone Dinah, a category 4 storm that stayed mostly offshore, Professor Walsh said.</li>
<li>The Bureau of Meteorology said the near-simultaneous landing of Cyclone Lam on the Northern Territory coast and Cyclone Marcia is the first recorded instance of twin severe cyclone events.</li>
