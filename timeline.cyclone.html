<li>Queensland residents and authorities are rushing to prepare as Cyclone Marcia intensifies and makes her presence felt.</li>
<li>While south-east Queensland and northern NSW have been hit by big storms in the past - including the "Great Gold Coast Cyclone" of February 1954 - it is likely such events were "hybrids or intense east coast lows" rather than cyclones, he said.</li>
<li>Kevin Walsh, a cyclone expert at the University of Melbourne agreed that Cyclone Marcia was an abnormal storm.</li>
<li>"It's pretty unusual for a category 5 cyclone to strike the coast of Queensland this far south," Associate Professor Walsh said.</li>
<li>Other big storms included a cyclone "very close to category 5" near Mackay in 1918 and Cyclone Dinah, a category 4 storm that stayed mostly offshore, Professor Walsh said.</li>
<li>The Bureau of Meteorology said the near-simultaneous landing of Cyclone Lam on the Northern Territory coast and Cyclone Marcia is the first recorded instance of twin severe cyclone events.</li>
