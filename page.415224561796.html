<h3>Day of mourning to mark east Ukraine mine disaster</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Rescuers found the bodies of the miners in the Zasyadko mine a day after a blast ripped through the shaft, emergency officials of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>All of the bodies had been brought to the surface for identification, while survivors were being treated in hospital for burns and gas poisoning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Zasyadko mine is located on the outskirts of Donetsk, not far from the frontline in the nearly year-long conflict between government forces and pro-Russian separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Throughout the fighting, the mine - one of Ukraine's biggest - had remained in operation.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>The Ukrainian military said that attacks on its positions had killed one soldier since Wednesday, and that a civilian working for the emergency services was killed by shelling in Avdiyivka, a village west of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Regional prosecutors have launched an investigation into the cause of the mine blast, but conceded that the probe was unlikely to proceed given that the area is in separatist hands.</td></tr>
