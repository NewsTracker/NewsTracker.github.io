<h3>Africaâ€™s Ebola outbreak has not run its course</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Africa's Ebola outbreak has not run its course Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Africa's Ebola epidemic has not run its course and around 30 people are still getting infected each week, the United Nations' special envoy for the disease said on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The worst recorded outbreak of the virus has killed more than 11,000 people across West Africa since late 2013, but had abated in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A new flare-up in Liberia is seen as a setback in the fight against it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The battle can be won, but it requires sustained effort, very careful negotiation with communities and perfection in follow-up of everybody who has been a contact," David Nabarro told a media briefing in Cape Town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said under normal circumstances, an infection rate of 30 people a week would be considered "a major, major outbreak".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Probably about one third of these people are not coming from the contact list, which means they are surprise cases, and that's a big worry," Nabarro earlier told a conference organised by the World Health Organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Infection rates are down from the peak of the crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Liberia reported a 17-year-old boy tested positive for the virus on June 30 - almost two months after the country was declared free of Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Liberia, the country worst hit by the outbreak, had been hailed as an example for neighbouring Guinea and Sierra Leone, which are also struggling to stop the spread of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Olawale Maiyegun, social affairs director at the African Union Commission, said it seemed communities were forgetting a key "ABC" or "avoid body contact" rule and becoming complacent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Where is the ABC rule? I saw people dancing together, I was alarmed in (Sierra Leone's capital) Freetown," Maiyegun told journalists at the same briefing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Ebola outbreak has galvanised a global response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Last week donor countries pledged another $3.4 billion in addition to $1.8 billion of unspent money in an effort to eradicate a disease that has wreaked economic and social havoc.</td></tr>
