<h3>This Is Why Apple Won't Say How Many Watches It Sold</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When Apple's Apple's quarterly numbers come out, it will report revenues, profits, earnings per share, gross margins, guidance and - perhaps most important of them all - how many iPhones it sold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Now, here's what it won't report, at least not in a straightforward manner: exactly how many Apple Watches it sold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Instead, analysts will have to dig for that information in the "other products" category, where Beats headphones, Apple TV, and accessories also live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The math shouldn't be that hard: last quarter Apple posted $1.7 billion in revenue in that category.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Analysts are all over the place on the watch, so we don't have a solid unit number to use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Also, we don't have a solid average price for the watch, so it's hard to figure a consensus revenue estimate for the watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The analysts at Stifel estimates Apple sold 3.3 million watches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If we use a $500 average selling price, then that would be an extra $1.7 billion in revenue for the "other" category.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In short, whatever numbers are out there won't be official or even exact - or, crucially, subject to questioning by analysts and reporters during the earnings call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Apple might tell you it doesn't want to tip its hand to competitors, now that smart watches are officially a mainstream thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Apple watchers will say the company doesn't want the market to know just how badly its first new product created after Steve Jobs' passing has failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Research firm Slice Intelligence laid the groundwork for this particular storyline last week in a report that suggested orders for Apple Watch dropped 90 percent since the device's debut.</td></tr>
