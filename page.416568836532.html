<h3>Greek PM says initial deal in bailout talks 'very close'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece's prime minister voiced hope that bailout talks between the cash-strapped country and its international creditors are "very close" to an initial deal, and ruled out early elections if the marathon negotiations fail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Alexis Tsipras told private Star TV that he believes a first agreement can be struck by the end of next week, which can then be ratified by Greece's European partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I think we are close," he said, in an interview screened just before midnight Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Since its election in January, Tsipras' radical left-led government has been locked in increasingly fraught talks with other European countries that use the euro currency - which provide the bulk of the bailout cash that has kept Greece afloat for five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At stake is a final 7.2 billion-euro ($7.8 billion) rescue loan installment, which will enable the country to keep up payments to its creditors - as well as to state employees and pensioners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Creditors are demanding further reforms and savings, and have encountered strong opposition from Tsipras' government that was elected on promises to alleviate five years of income cuts and fiscal pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tsipras ruled out early elections if the talks fail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But, while insisting he expects an agreement, he did not exclude holding a referendum on the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"If I end up having an agreement that puts me outside the limits (of my mandate), I will have no other resort," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The people will decide - obviously without elections, I want to make that clear."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Earlier Monday, Greece reshuffled its bailout negotiating team following fierce criticism of its flamboyant finance minister, meeting with market applause as investors hoped it will facilitate a deal to save the country from bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tsipras insisted that Yanis Varoufakis, who has come under fire from his European peers for dragging his feet in the bailout talks, continued to enjoy the government's support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He will continue to lead the negotiations, which have been delayed for three months.</td></tr>
