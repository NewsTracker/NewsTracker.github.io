<h3>Foreigners train Nigerian troops as "final onslaught" hits Boko Haram</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>According to security and diplomatic sources, Nigeria has brought in hundreds of mercenaries to give its offensive against the Islamist militant group a shot in the arm ahead of the March 28 presidential elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But government spokesman Mike Omeri said foreigners on the ground were only engaged in training Nigerian troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"There are trainers on the ground to assist in the handling of equipment," Omeri told Reuters on the sidelines of a news conference in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They simulate, they teach. These are the things they do."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Asked if they were directly involved in fighting, he said: "I am not aware of that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Africa's most populous nation and top energy producer has been plagued by the Boko Haram insurgency since 2009, when insurgents intensified efforts to establish an Islamic caliphate in the northeastern Borno state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However, this year Nigeria and its neighbors have launched a series of offensives to recapture territory, turning the tide against Boko Haram in the run-up to the hotly contested presidential poll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Omeri would not confirm how many foreigners were involved but said they had come from the same countries that had provided military equipment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He cited South Africa, Russia and South Korea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Acquisition of recruitment and military hardware is done through a number of processes. There are government-to-government exchanges and there are those who also come through contractors," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The contractors' stay in Nigeria would end when local troops had become proficient at handling the equipment, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This is training on site and maybe this is why the people on the ground have been described as mercenaries."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He declined to predict how long it would take for the military to regain full control.</td></tr>

<h3>Jeffrey Orridge named CFL's 13th commissioner</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mark Cohon took the CFL to unprecedented heights during his eight years as commissioner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The man hired on Tuesday to replace him will be expected to take it even higher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>CFL board chairman Jim Lawson introduced sports executive Jeffrey Orridge as the league's 13th commissioner during a press conference in Toronto, and it was clear from the start the league's owners and presidents envision big things from the new man in the big chair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"He is going to be the perfect person to work with our players, work with our fans and work with the league," Lawson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He has the skill set to take this league to the next level."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>More specifically, Orridge's background features - among other things - sports business, marketing, brand building, licencing, merchandising and contract negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Because of all those things that I bring to the table," Orridge said, "we're really poised for some very, very exciting things."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Orridge, who is leaving his role as CBC Sports' executive director and Olympics general manager, will start the CFL gig on April 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His first order of business will be to finish what Cohon started with the Toronto Argonauts, who will need a new home after they are booted out of Rogers Centre no later than 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Orridge hasn't jumped into that quagmire yet, but Lawson reported the drive to get the Argos into BMO Field is progressing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"What I can say on that is discussions are ongoing and I'd prefer not to comment on where they're at," Lawson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The good news is that I'd prefer not to comment where they're at, so that means they are alive and moving along."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Cohon announced last August he was moving on after nearly a decade at the helm, and the search for his successor began almost immediately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Lawson said many great candidates stepped forward, but it was Orridge's sports business acumen that led to the board's unanimous decision to hire him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The league's bosses were not concerned that Orridge was part of the CBC negotiating team that lost the rights to the network's NHL coverage a year and a half ago, although he will be on the other side of the table when the CFL's current $200 million broadcast agreement, which was the highlight of Cohon's tenure, ends after the 2018 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Orridge did lock up the 2015 Pan Am Games and the Olympics through 2020 for the national broadcaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"He impressed the CFL and the board of governors just with his background that he has in broadcast, his international experience working with major brands and his digital experience," Winnipeg Blue Bombers president and CEO Wade Miller said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"He's carrying on from what Mark has done. The CFL's in a good place, and he's the right guy to take it to the next level."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Orridge, who studied law at Harvard University, is actually a New York native, but he has spent the last eight years in Canada and is poised to become a Canadian citizen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The first African-American commissioner of a major North American league became a fan of the CFL as a youngster because the league didn't care what colour your skin was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"If you were capable, you could play any position and you could compete," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"That's why I've been a fan of the CFL for decades. I love our game, I love the positive power of sport, I love this country, and I couldn't be more proud and also more humble to be part of something as special as the CFL."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Another item on Orridge's to-do list will be to get the next generation to love the CFL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>More options for sports and entertainment these days make the selling of anything a tougher task, and the CFL fan base is quite clearly a mature one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It will also be up to the new commish, who goes way back with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, to fight for national sponsorship dollars as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Orridge certainly knows how to draw them in if the 2014 Winter Olympics are any indication.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He was managing the Olympics for CBC when it created the broadcast app that was downloaded 2.6 million times and viewed by more than a third of Canadians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In other words, look for the CFL to reach new digital heights under Orridge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"We need to move the needle," Lawson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"We need to reach out to that next generation. So leadership, media, growing revenue ... these are all things that hit right in Jeffrey's sweet spot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The new commish plans to travel to every CFL city and visit with every league partner in his first 90 days on the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It will kick off his mission to make the CFL "the quintessential sports brand not just in North America but within the world, because it's uniquely Canadian and I don't think there's any other product like it in the world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Even though Jeffrey Orridge was born in the U.S. and didn't move to the Great White North until he was in his 40s, it was clear during his introductory press conference on Tuesday that he is becoming quite comfortable in his new home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The new CFL commissioner grew up in New York City playing basketball, football, baseball and running track, and he dreamed of a professional playing career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Now he has done one better by being tasked to run an entire football league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"I'm still waiting for that growth spurt that my parents promised me when I was in Grade 8, but it hasn't happened yet," Orridge said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"But my dream job has actually happened, and I can't imagine a better job for me right now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>What was noticeable about that statement was Orridge said "Grade 8" instead of "eighth grade," which is the difference in how most Canadians and Americans describe their grades, respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>So he's practically a maple syrup drinking, moose loving, three-down football fanatic already!</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Even though some may raise an eyebrow at an American running the CFL, Orridge believes the language of sport has no boundaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"Whether it was growing brands globally or businesses, negotiating rights agreements, working with elite athletes or working with children in some of the most underprivileged communities on this planet, I've been living and breathing sport most of my life," Orridge said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"And I actually believe it's because of my international background and various experiences that I recognize just how truly unique and important this league is to Canadians and Canada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"The CFL is that connective tissue. The teams bring communities together, and the Grey Cup certainly unites a nation. The power of sport is truly embodied in the CFL."</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Sure sounds like someone who can get the job done, eh?</td></tr>
