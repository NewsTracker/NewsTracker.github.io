<h3>Chechen commander in Ukraine drawn into Russian intrigue</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this photo taken on Monday March 2, 2015, Adam Osmayev, the commander of a battalion of Chechens fighting against Russia-backed rebels, is in the town of Lysychansk, Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Russian pro-Kremlin newspapers published reports based on unidentified sources in the security services that accused the Ukrainian government and Osmayev of ordering the murder of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, the claims Osmayev has denied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>LYSYCHANSK, Ukraine (AP) - From a dimly lit room at his base in eastern Ukraine, the commander of a battalion of Chechens fighting Russia-backed rebels looked shaken as TV broadcast news of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov's slaying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Adam Osmayev hailed Nemtsov as a "true hero" both for condemning Russia's war against separatists in Chechnya and for decrying Russian intervention in the current conflict in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Watch them try to tie Ukraine to this (murder) in some way," Osmayev added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He was half-joking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But two weeks later, Kremlin-friendly Russian newspapers published reports based on unidentified sources in the security services that accused the Ukrainian government and also Osmayev himself of ordering the Feb. 27 murder of Nemtsov in central Moscow in an attempt to destabilize Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Osmayev denies involvement and no evidence has been presented linking him to the hit on Nemtsov, who was a relentless critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Attempts to implicate the British-educated Chechen commander appear to be part of efforts aimed at deflecting attention from anyone close to Putin, including his security services and the powerful leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Within days of Nemtsov's assassination, investigators arrested five Chechens, including a senior officer in Kadyrov's police force, and charged them with carrying out the killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>All five have denied the charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The arrests heralded a crisis in relations between the Kremlin and Kadyrov, who rules Chechnya like a personal fiefdom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With generous subsidies from Moscow, he has rebuilt the region after two separatist wars and has relied on his feared security forces to track down and kill foes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His men have steadily expanded their sway beyond Chechnya to control lucrative businesses in Moscow and elsewhere in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Leaders of federal law enforcement agencies have watched Kadyrov's growing power with dismay and have made no secret of their desire to curb him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some observers speculated that the killing might have been ordered by Kadyrov's enemies in the federal government - an attempt to prompt Putin to fire or at least punish the Chechen leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>If such a plan existed, it underestimated Putin's reliance on Kadyrov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The relative stability in Chechnya is seen as one of Putin's main achievements, and he sees the burly red-haired Chechen strongman as key to maintaining the status quo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Putin quickly sent a signal that he intended to stand by Kadyrov by awarding him the Order of Honor for distinguished public service, a day after Kadyrov spoke out in defense of the arrested Chechens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The arrests were a rare case in which federal law enforcement agents managed to nab a member of Kadyrov's security force, but the investigation then seemed to fizzle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Russian media, citing investigators, have pointed to a possible link between the suspected triggerman, Zaur Dadaev, and his commander, Ruslan Geremeyev, a senior officer in the Chechen police force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But Geremeyev is in Chechnya and off limits to federal investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Russian newspapers have floated a variety of theories about the killing that have muddied the waters - a possible attempt to defuse tensions with Kadyrov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Some reports claimed that investigators believe Dadaev and his suspected accomplices could have acted on their own, even though most observers agree that a senior officer in Kadyrov's security force would not have acted without sanction from his superiors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Dadaev, in turn, has rescinded his initial testimony, saying he was beaten and pressured to confess.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The reports pointing to Osmayev, a Kadyrov foe, were seen as part of these efforts to deflect attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"State-controlled media have put forward a theory that is politically satisfying for Russia's security forces, the Kremlin, Kadyrov and all of their rival groups - namely, that Chechen Adam Osmayev ordered Nemtsov's murder," political analyst Georgy Bovt wrote in a commentary published in The Moscow Times.</td></tr>
