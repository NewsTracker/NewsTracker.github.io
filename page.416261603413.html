<h3>Obama says Ebola-fighting goal is to prevent any new cases</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"We've seen major progress," Obama said during a White House meeting with the presidents of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone to get a handle on the current situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He pointed out that last week there were fewer than 40 cases in the region, with no cases reported in Liberia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ebola has killed more than 10,000 people in the yearlong-plus outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Now we're focused on the shared goal, and that is getting to zero," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The three presidents -- Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, Alpha Conde of Guinea and Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone -- were in the United States for meetings with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to help confront the economic crises created by the disease in their respective countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The World Health Organization last week said the outbreak still qualifies as an international emergency even though the number of cases has plummeted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At Ebola's peak last year, health officials were reporting hundreds of new cases a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We can't be complacent," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This virus is unpredictable, we have to be vigilant and the international community has to be fully engaged in a partnership with these three countries until there are no cases of Ebola in these countries."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Capitol Hill, top government health officials echoed the president's message, saying that while recent efforts fighting Ebola have been encouraging, the threat is far from over,.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In testimony before a House panel, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden said the epidemic in Liberia is under control, and that a similar reduction in cases has been seen in Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Guinea has made progress, too, but still faces challenges, said Frieden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>National Institutes of Health infectious diseases chief Dr. Anthony Fauci said work being done on a vaccine is also showing promise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>So far, more than 1,100 people in Liberia have been enrolled in the clinical trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It is safe and it is inducing a response that one would predict would be protective, although obviously you need to have field proof of that," Fauci told lawmakers on a health appropriations subcommittee.</td></tr>
