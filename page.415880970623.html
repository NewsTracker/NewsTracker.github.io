<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This product image provided by Microsoft shows the company's new Surface 3 tablet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Microsoft is making the cheaper version of its Surface Pro 3 tablet computer in an effort to reach more people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Microsoft is making a cheaper version of its Surface Pro 3 tablet computer in an effort to reach students and budget-conscious families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Graphic artists, engineers and finance professionals needing to run complex software might still want the company's higher-end Pro 3, said Dennis Meinhardt, director of program management for Surface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the Surface 3 should be good for everyday tasks, he said, and brings the Pro 3's premium feel to a device that will be affordable to more people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Priced in Canada at $639 (vs $849 to $1,999 for the Pro 3), the new tablet has a slightly smaller screen - 10.8 inches rather than 12 - a slower processor, and less flexible kickstand - just three angles rather than unlimited positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A version with more storage and memory will cost $599.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A keyboard cover, one of the Surface's distinctive features, adds another $129.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Microsoft bills the Surface line as a laptop replacement when used with the cover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And Microsoft will sell a stylus separately for $49.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>(It's included with the Pro 3.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Panos Panay, Microsoft's vice president for surface computing, introduced the Surface Pro 3 tablet in May 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The new Surface model is thinner and lighter, partly because it gets rid of the fan - similar to Apple's new MacBook laptop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>At 214 pixels per inch, the screen resolution is comparable to the Pro 3's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Battery life is promised at 10 hours for video playback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Surface 3 runs the regular version of Windows 8.1, just like the Pro 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In the past, Microsoft has used a lightweight version called RT in its cheaper tablets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Surface 3 also has a USB port, a feature that distinguishes the Surface line from most rival tablets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Microsoft Corp. expects to ship the new device around May 5, with advance orders starting immediately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Versions with LTE cellular access will sell for $100 US more in the U.S. at a later date through T-Mobile and Verizon, with other carriers expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Data plans cost extra.</td></tr>
