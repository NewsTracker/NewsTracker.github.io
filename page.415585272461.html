<h3>Christie Administration Deal With Exxon Was Years in the Making</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>By then, a judge had held Exxon liable for potential damages in the contamination of more than 1,000 acres of land at refinery sites in Bayonne and Linden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In court, the state was seeking $8.9 billion, including more than $2 billion for the primary restoration of the properties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the state's proposal at the meeting in Trenton fell far short of that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The administration of Gov. Chris Christie, in its first formal settlement offer, said it would accept $325 million, according to a senior administration official and a representative of Exxon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Exxon rejected the offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The meeting, which has not previously been disclosed, shows that the Christie administration had pushed for over two years to settle the case for much less than the state was seeking in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>New Jersey agreed last month to settle the litigation for $225 million, prompting broad criticism that the Christie administration had taken pennies on the dollar to end the hard-fought case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Not only was the sum less than what the state offered to accept in 2012, but it also came at an odd moment: A ruling on damages was believed to be imminent, after an eight-month trial last year at which the state sought to prove its damages claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Environmental advocates and some lawmakers have accused Mr. Christie, a Republican, of sacrificing the environment to help the state address more immediate shortfalls in its budget, allegations the Christie administration has vigorously rejected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Thursday, the Assembly Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the proposed settlement, which still requires a judge's approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Records of the settlement proposals are not public; the state official and others interviewed for this article who had knowledge of the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were also not public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Whatever the political and legal analysis that led to the $225 million deal, the seeds of an agreement were planted years earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Familiar to drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike, the Linden refinery, known as Bayway, has reinforced the image of the state as almost irretrievably toxic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There, marshland adjacent to a creek was "now mostly covered with a tar of petroleum products or filled with other hazardous constituents and debris," according to a state environmental official quoted in a 2006 affidavit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He also cited 45 acres of "sludge lagoons," former tidal marshes that had been used as hazardous-waste disposal facilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Exxon agreed in 1991 to clean up both the Bayway and Bayonne sites, subject to state approval, with "no cap" on what it would pay, as Mr. Christie recently pointed out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The company says that to date, it has spent about $260 million on those efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But the 1991 agreement did not block the state from suing for the loss of natural resources, which it did in 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A news release issued at the time said Exxon had "balked at the opportunity" to reach "a reasonable settlement" to resolve liability for the natural resource damage at the sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The release added that the state's environmental commissioner, Bradley M. Campbell, had issued an administrative subpoena for information from Exxon about its "hundreds of potentially contaminated sites to ensure that the public is fully compensated for natural resource damage claims."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The release cited nearly 1,000 gas stations and other sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>As the case proceeded, Exxon was held strictly liable, that is, regardless of fault, for potential restoration costs and damages to compensate for the public's "loss of use" of the natural resources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Exxon argued that no damages should be awarded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In spring 2008, the administration of Gov. Jon S. Corzine, a Democrat who was Mr. Christie's predecessor, made Exxon a settlement offer that the state valued at roughly $550 million (about $150 million in cash and $400 million in land restoration projects), according to the senior Christie administration official.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Exxon rejected the proposal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The senior official said the 2008 offer served as a "framework" for how New Jersey officials would arrive at their 2012 settlement demand of $325 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Corzine administration proposal, however, was made before a ruling that bolstered the state's position on potential damages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In 2009, a judge rejected Exxon's arguments that New Jersey could only seek damages for contamination that had occurred after the 1970s-era law that authorized such suits was enacted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>That meant the state could seek damages dating to when it claimed the contamination had begun: in the 1870s at Bayonne, and the early 1900s at Bayway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Exxon did win a ruling in 2009 that said it was not responsible for natural resource damages linked to physical modifications at the refinery properties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A few years would pass before the possibility of a settlement was broached again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>During that time, the attorney general's office lost the only two natural resource damages cases it had taken to trial, strengthening Exxon's argument for New Jersey to settle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In April 2012, Exxon's lead lawyer, Theodore V. Wells Jr., met with Christopher S. Porrino, then an official in the attorney general's office, to lay out the company's position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Mr. Wells, co-chairman of the litigation department of the Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison law firm, had been hired in 2006.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>His argument was that any deal should fall significantly below $100 million, roughly the aggregate value of all of the state's natural resource damage settlements from 2004 to that point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>He and his team offered data showing that the largest settlement reached by the state in such a case was $17 million, while the average of the 10 highest such deals was $6.3 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>At the meeting in August 2012, Exxon's team, which had litigated the case through three Democratic administrations, included a new face: George Gilmore, a lawyer and influential fixture of state Republican politics who had served on Mr. Christie's transition team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Mr. Gilmore had been retained by Exxon after the governor's election to assist in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>He ended his relationship with the company before the trial began in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The state's legal team included Mr. Porrino and John J. Hoffman, another top official in the attorney general's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Both would later fill even more senior posts: Mr. Porrino as the governor's chief counsel and Mr. Hoffman as the acting attorney general.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Mr. Wells said in the meeting that he considered the $325 million offer "outrageous," a person with knowledge of the discussions recalled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Mr. Wells largely repeated the arguments he had made before and said the company did not feel it was being treated fairly or consistently with how other major corporations had been treated in such cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>During these early talks, Exxon also indicated that it wanted any deal to resolve potential natural resource liability claims related to the gas stations and other sites, where, it asserted, contamination had been minimal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>If that assertion proved to be true, state officials said, such claims could be included in a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The Christie administration lawyers also made it clear that any settlement had to exceed $100 million for the state to take it seriously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Exxon countered later in 2012 with an offer of $20 million, which the state rejected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>In January 2013, at a court hearing in Elizabeth, N.J., Allan Kanner, an outside lawyer retained by the state, told a judge that the parties had made offers, and that Mr. Porrino, who was present in court, had attended all of the meetings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"We just are at an impasse," Mr. Kanner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>In December 2013, Exxon raised its offer to $66 million, in cash and land, according to one person with knowledge of the settlement talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>The state countered with an offer of about $290 million, which also included land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>In January 2014, as the damages trial was beginning, Mr. Porrino became Mr. Christie's counsel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>In April, during the trial, Exxon raised its offer to $100 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Exxon then raised its offer to $200 million, and as Mr. Wells and Mr. Kanner and their teams continued to fight in court, the settlement was negotiated by other lawyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>The final deal, under which Exxon agreed to pay $225 million, would also resolve New Jersey's claims related to the service stations and other facilities, which the state was now describing as "relatively minor," according to a news release from the attorney general's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>The state has not released a list of those sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Mr. Hoffman said last week that had the state not settled the litigation, the matter would have been "litigated for many years to come with an uncertain outcome that could threaten the state's recovery in this case" and potentially jeopardize other significant natural resource damage recoveries the state was pursuing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Recently, Mr. Campbell, the former environmental commissioner, wrote an Op-Ed article in The New York Times that was critical of Mr. Porrino's role, saying the governor's counsel "inserted himself into the case, elbowed aside the attorney general and career employees who had developed and prosecuted the litigation and cut the deal favorable to Exxon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>In response, the senior state official said last week that Mr. Porrino, while in the attorney general's office, had "significant involvement in trying to force Exxon Mobil into meaningful settlement talks."</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Later, the official said, Mr. Porrino, as Mr. Christie's counsel and working with others, "appropriately continued those efforts in his new role."</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>At the Assembly hearing on Thursday, Mr. Hoffman and Bob Martin, the environmental commissioner, were absent: They had declined an invitation to testify, the committee chairman, John F. McKeon, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>One witness, Debbie Mans, executive director of NY/NJ Baykeeper, questioned Exxon's cleanup efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>"Anyone who thinks that Exxon Mobil will complete a comprehensive cleanup of these sites is dreaming," she testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>An earlier version of this article misstated the time frame for which Exxon argued New Jersey could seek damages for environmental contamination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Exxon argued that damages could be sought only for contamination after the enactment of a 1970s-era law authorizing such suits, not before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Because of an editing error, a picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the status of the Bayway refinery in Linden, N.J. It was once owned by Exxon Mobil; that company no longer owns it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on March 20, 2015, on page A23 of the New York edition with the headline: New Jersey's $225 Million Settlement With Exxon Was Years in the Making.</td></tr>

<h3>17 foreign tourists killed in Tunisia were cruise passengers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Passengers of Mediterranean cruise lines Costa Crociere and MSC Cruises were visiting the National Bardo Museum when gunmen stormed it Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MSC said 12 of its guests were killed - three French, three Japanese, two Spanish, two Colombian, one British and one Belgian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Costa said five of its passengers were killed - four Italians and a Russian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In addition, MSC reported 13 passengers injured, while Costa reported eight injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Thursday morning, both the MSC Splendida and Costa's Fascinosa ship left Tunisia with their remaining passengers, bound for Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca, respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Costa said it would pay to fly passengers home if they didn't want to continue with the cruise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>MSC said it was suspending Tunisian ports of call for the rest of the 2015 summer season, with its ships docking instead in Malta, Palma de Mallorca, Sardinia or Corfu, Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>MSC chairman Pierfrancesco Vago said the company hoped to return to Tunisia, but that for now tourists view it as a "no-go zone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Until we receive the necessary reassurances that the security situation has returned to normal, we have to take our guests to alternative Mediterranean destinations," he said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Costa didn't say how long its suspension would last and that it was still figuring out alternative itineraries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The security of our guests and crew is Costa Crociere's priority and a necessary condition for calm and pleasant vacations," Costa said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Italy's foreign ministry confirmed Thursday that four Italians were among the 23 dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tunisian officials didn't mention a Russian among those killed, and it wasn't immediately possible to reconcile the different claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Separately, Italy announced it was beefing up its military presence in the Mediterranean to better protect against extremist threats from Libya and Tunisia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti said additional ships, aircraft and drones would be called up to protect off-shore oil rigs, maritime ships and provide surveillance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>One of Costa's employees has had a double dose of bad luck: Antonello Tonna, the Fascinosa's pianist, was also aboard the Costa Concordia when it slammed into rocks and capsized off Tuscany on Jan. 13, 2012, killing 32 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Concordia's captain was recently convicted of manslaughter and causing the wreck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"After three years I decided to go back because I missed the ships," Tonna told RAI state television of his recent decision to return to playing at sea following the trauma of the Concordia disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tonna hadn't gone to the museum Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He was on board when his wife told him about the attack in a text message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said he subsequently saw teary, shaken passengers returning to their cabins.</td></tr>
