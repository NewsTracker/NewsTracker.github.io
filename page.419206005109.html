<h3>Nusra Front says it will withdraw from frontline against Islamic State in Syria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Leaving? A Nusra Front fighter carries weapons in the town of Safsafa in the Hama countryside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Baziantep, Turkey: The Syrian affiliate of al-Qaeda has announced its withdrawal from frontline positions against the Islamic State in northern Syria, saying that it disagrees with plans by Turkey and the United States to clear the extremists from an area along the Turkish border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a statement on Monday, the al-Qaeda linked group the Nusra Front said the proposed plan was designed primarily to protect "Turkish national security" and not to advance the Syrian rebel cause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Syrian activists in the area reported the withdrawal of the Nusra Front in recent days, saying that other rebel groups had taken up their vacated positions to prevent an advance by Islamic State forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A member of Nusra Front during a May offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But on Monday, a United States Defence Department official said the US did not believe the statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We've not yet seen any movements on the ground that would indicate they are following through with it," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss battlefield issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Nusra Front's withdrawal from rural positions north-east of the Syrian city of Aleppo came amid newly announced steps by Turkey and the United States to fight the Islamic State in Syria.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>US and Turkish officials last month described plans to provide military support to Syrian rebels to clear the Islamic State, from a roughly 95-kilometre-long strip of territory along the Turkish border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But two weeks later, much remains unclear about the plan, including how far into Syria the proposed Islamic State-free zone will extend; which rebel forces will push back the Islamic State fighters and hold any ground taken from them; and what sort of military support these forces will receive to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At the same time, a US plan to train and arm rebels to fight the Islamic State suffered a major setback when leaders of the United States-backed group, known as Division 30, were captured by the Nusra Front soon after entering Syria last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Their fate remains unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Last week, a senior American official confirmed that one of the newly trained fighters had been killed and two others wounded in an attack by the Nusra Front on their base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The United States launched airstrikes to try to defend the force, the first time it has provided direct air support to US-trained forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Syrian rebels and activists have criticised the US program, saying it is too small to make a difference and is focused on a rebel group that few people know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Division 30 is made up mostly of fighters from Syria's Turkmen minority, and few other rebels had ever heard of it before it was attacked by the Nusra Front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>President Obama announced the program in May, saying that it would train and arm more than 5000 fighters a year to fight the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But the program faced a number of setbacks even before it was attacked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A number of fighters in the first training group quit and returned to Syria before finishing the program, leaving a graduating class of fewer than 60 fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Nusra Front made no mention of the US-backed fighters in its statement on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It said that Turkey was interested in what its officials call a "safe zone" because it was worried about Kurdish forces that have seized much of the land across its border in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It said that the decision to push the Islamic State out of the proposed safe zone was not "the free choice of the fighting factions; in fact, its first goal is the national security of Turkey."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Nusra Front said it was deploying its fighters to other front lines to fight both the Islamic State and the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Insurgent groups including the Nusra Front escalated an attack on some of the last government-controlled areas in the north-western province of Idlib province on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Opposition-affiliated media broadcast images of a large explosion targeting government forces in the village of al-Foua.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that tracks the war using sources on the ground, reported heavy fighting between rebels including the Nusra Front, and pro-government forces it said were led by Lebanon's Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shiite group fighting alongside the Syrian army.</td></tr>
