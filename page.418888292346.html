<h3>Meteorologists eye rare early season tropical cyclone in Pacific</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A tropical low over the Solomon Islands may develop into another cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A tropical depression over the Solomon Islands is being watched closely by meteorologists and climate experts alike in case the deep low pressure system forms into a second rare early season cyclone for the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This month, Cyclone Raquel became the first July cyclone in Australia's eastern region since the satellite era began in the early 1970s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jess Carey, a spokesman from the Bureau of Meteorology's Queensland office, said there was only about a one in five chance that the low over the islands would develop into a cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Conditions were not yet conducive for the low to form into a cyclone-strength storm but they might be "enhanced" over the weekend or early next week, Mr Carey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Its direction could be "pretty much any direction on the compass", although at a distance of 2000 kilometres from the Queensland coast it was unlikely to have an impact on the Australia mainland, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Naming rights for the event, should it become a cyclone, depended on whether it formed in Australia's eastern zone or Fiji's area of coverage, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Should it enter Australia's zone, the storm would be the first clear August cyclone in the satellite era in that region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That, along with Cyclone Raquel, was of particular interest to climatologists, Mr Carey said.</td></tr>
