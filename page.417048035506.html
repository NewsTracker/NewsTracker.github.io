<tr><td>3</td><td>Not even Gerrit Cole can beat the Chicago Cubs right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lester outpitched Cole with seven gutsy innings, and the Cubs defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-1 on Saturday for their sixth straight win.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>He began the day with a 6-0 record and a 2.92 ERA in six career starts against the Cubs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''They were fouling pitches off and I wasn't executing with two strikes,'' Cole said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Pirates had at least one hit in Lester's last six innings, but Rodriguez's second homer on the first pitch of the third was all the scoring they could manage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They went 1 for 14 with runners in scoring position and left 10 men on base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''There's not many guys in that lineup that didn't get a shot at driving in a run,'' Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said.</td></tr>
