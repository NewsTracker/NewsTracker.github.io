<h3>Mexico Supreme Court Opens Door to Gay Marriage Nationwide</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mexico's supreme court has ruled it is unconstitutional for Mexican states to bar same-sex marriages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But the court's ruling is considered a "jurisprudential thesis" and does not invalidate any state laws, meaning gay couples denied the right to wed would have to turn to the courts individually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Given the ruling, judges and courts would have to approve same-sex marriages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The high court ruled that any state law which considers the ultimate purpose of marriage to be "procreation, and or defines (marriage) as celebrated between a man and a woman, is unconstitutional."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Gay marriage is legal in some parts of Mexico, including Mexico City and the northern state of Coahuila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The ruling was delivered June 3, but didn't become known until this week.</td></tr>
