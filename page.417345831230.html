<h3>Greece could use 'Zambia' option as progress on deal unclear</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece and rescue lenders remained at odds over whether the two sides are close to a breakthrough in negotiations, as the International Monetary Fund confirmed Thursday that Athens had the right to ask for "bundled" repayments next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Countries do have the option of bundling when they have a series of payments in a given month ... making a single payment at the end of that month," IMF spokesman William Murray said in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said Athens hadn't made a request to combine repayments, adding that the last country to do so was Zambia three decades ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece has warned it may be unable to repay an IMF loan due on June 5 unless it reaches a deal with emergency creditors to unlock remaining bailout funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It has four IMF repayments due next month, through June 19.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In Athens, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras held an hour-long call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, according to government officials who remained optimistic a deal was imminent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It is based on very specific facts," government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We are going into these negotiations with the aim to have an agreement with our partners by Sunday."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Murray refused to comment on when a deal could be struck, insisting "work still needs to be done" - a note of caution echoed in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Talks will continue in the coming days, and further progress is needed," European Commission spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We're not there yet. There are open issues which need to be resolved."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The commission is one of the three institutions negotiating with Greece, along with the IMF and European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tsipras' government, elected in January on an anti-austerity platform, has been in talks for four months on what reforms it should make to get the final bailout installment of 7.2 billion euros ($8 billion) from fellow eurozone states and the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Creditors insist Athens must take more long-term measures to ensure its economy is reformed and doesn't slip back into the bad habits of the past, with reckless borrowing and a large and inefficient public sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Failure to reach an agreement could eventually cause Greece to drop out of the euro, roiling European and global markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Greece's conservative opposition criticized the government's handling of the negotiation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It is obvious that the government is at a dead-end," New Democracy party spokesman Kostas Karagounis said.</td></tr>
