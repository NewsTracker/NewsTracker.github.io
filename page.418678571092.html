<h3>Crying kid in diner ignites Facebook war between mom, owner</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- The owner of a Maine diner says she's not sorry for yelling at a 2-year-old child for crying in her restaurant because it got the girl to be quiet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Darla Neugebauer, owner of Marcy's Diner in Portland, is defending her actions amid social media uproar touched off when the child's mother blasted Neugebauer on Marcy's Facebook page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Neugebauer defended herself in a profanity-laced response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The initial wave of reaction included people who said they'll never eat at the restaurant again; this morning, although Neugebauer's post had been deleted, the diner's Facebook page was flooded with support for the owner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Neugebauer wrote on Facebook that the girl had been crying for more than 40 minutes by the time she slammed her hands on the counter and told the girl to be quiet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She told WCSH-TV that her waitress had warned the parents that the order of three 12-inch pancakes was not only too large for the child but would take extra time to prepare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The parents nevertheless stuck with the order, she said, then proceeded to ignore their child's crying and didn't help her eat once the food arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Life's full of choices and you've got to live with all of them," Neugebauer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I chose to yell at a kid, it made her shut-up, which made me happy, it made my staff happy, it made the 75 other people dining here happy, and they left, they may never come back, other people may not come in. Their loss really."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tara Carson, the mother of the child, wrote on Facebook that anyone with young children should understand that crying is normal after waiting such a long time for food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I turned to my daughter and I was like 'Listen, this is how I'm raising you not to be as an adult. Like, you will never be like this when you get older,'" Carson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I felt helpless as a mom that, you know, I couldn't do anything to help her, because I can't explain why there's crazy people in this world that behave like that."</td></tr>
