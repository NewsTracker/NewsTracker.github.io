<h3>Islamic State hits Shiite mosque in Kuwait, killing 27 people</h3>

<tr><td>3</td><td>KUWAIT CITY - A suicide bomber purportedly from an Islamic State affiliate unleashed the first terrorist attack in Kuwait in more than two decades on Friday, killing at least 27 people and wounding scores more in a bombing that targeted Shiite worshipers after midday prayers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The attack, which hit the capital of Kuwait City, followed the Islamic State group's call for violence during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It also underscored the Islamic State group's reach and its ability to carry out large-scale attacks - even in this mostly quiet and relatively secure Gulf Arab nation, with its wealthy capital that is home to glistening shopping malls, five-star hotels and Western retail chains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The bombing struck the Imam Sadiq Mosque in the residential neighborhood of al-Sawabir, one of the oldest Shiite mosques in this predominantly Sunni Arab nation where at least at third of the population is believed to be Shiite Muslim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The explosion ripped through the back of the mosque, near the door, as worshippers stood shoulder-to-shoulder in group prayer, according to one of the witnesses, Hassan al-Haddad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said that other worshippers behind him recounted seeing a man walk in, stand in the back with other congregants and detonate his device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A posting on a Twitter account known to belong to the Islamic State affiliate that calls itself the Najd Province, claimed the explosion was the work of a suicide bomber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It was the third attack in five weeks to be claimed by Najd Province - a name that's a reference to the central region of Saudi Arabia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Islamic State extremists regard Shiite Muslims as heretics, and refer to them derogatively as "rejectionists."</td></tr>
