<h3>Morrison holds form to win Spanish Open</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 30-year-old had shared the overnight lead with compatriot David Howell at the Real Club de Golf El Prat, near Barcelona and never looked back after chipping in from behind the green on the fifth for a birdie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He extended his advantage with a 12-foot putt on the ninth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Despite pressure from Howell, Francesco Molinari and defending champion Miguel Angel Jimenez a run of eight straight pars took Morrison to the 18th three shots clear of the chasing field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The win was sealed in style with a birdie from 10 feet to earn the biggest prize of his career of 250,000 euros ( 183,000).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It feels amazing," Morrison told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The game plan was to stick to my process, I know it's a cliche but it's true.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Even down to that last putt I wanted to hole that putt badly. I stuck to my process all day long and executed which feels amazing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The victory -- Morrison's first since Madeira five years ago -- took him from 296th in the world rankings to just outside the top 160.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Spain's Jimenez, Italian Molinari, Howell and Frenchman Edouard Espana finished in a four-way tie for second place on six under par.</td></tr>
