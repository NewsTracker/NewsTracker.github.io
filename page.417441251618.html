<h3>Supreme Court gives Facebook 'rapper' second chance in threat case</h3>

<tr><td>3</td><td>WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court struck another blow for free speech Monday, ruling that threats made over the Internet should include at least some measure of intent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The decision was a temporary victory for Anthony Elonis and those like him whose threatening words on Facebook or similar social media sites may instill fear in their targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was a defeat for the government and groups that defend victims of domestic violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the 8-1 decision for a near-unanimous court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It was based only on the court's interpretation of a federal statute, rather than more broadly under the First Amendment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The ruling also left open the possibility -- indeed, perhaps even the likelihood -- that Elonis will be found guilty under the tougher standard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While Roberts said "negligence is not sufficient to support a conviction," he made clear that the threat would be a crime if it was intended as a threat or if Elonis knew it would be viewed as one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The jury was instructed that the government need prove only that a reasonable person would regard Elonis's communications as threats, and that was error," Roberts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Federal criminal liability generally does not turn solely on the results of an act without considering the defendant's mental state."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, and Justice Samuel Alito dissented in part.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Both would have said mere recklessness on Elonis' part would be sufficient for conviction; Roberts left it up to the lower court to decide that question first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The court's disposition of this case is certain to cause confusion and serious problems," Alito wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>While he, too, would have reversed Elonis' conviction and sent the case back for further review, he said the court should have defined what does and does not constitute a true threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The court declines to say," he lamented.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Attorneys and judges are left to guess. This will have regrettable consequences."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Elonis was 27 and recently unemployed in Pennsylvania five years ago when he began posting threats against his estranged wife and others, from a generic kindergarten class to the FBI agents who came to his door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He was convicted on four counts of transmitting threats and sentenced to 44 months in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He completed his term a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The question that has split federal appeals courts is whether the threats must be intentional, or whether they are illegal just because a "reasonable person" -- such as those on the receiving end -- takes them seriously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Elonis was convicted under the latter standard; a majority of justices ruled that's not sufficient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Elonis might not be off the hook, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The high court's ruling means his case will be sent back to a lower court to determine whether he meant what he posted or was at least reckless in posting it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>If the court rules that his posts were intentionally or recklessly threatening, his conviction would stand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The case represents a critical test of free speech in the Internet age, when words that seem threatening emanate from violent spouses and video game-players alike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The justices were seeking a rule that could result in locking up the former and letting the latter off the hook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Elonis' case offered a perfect test.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>After his wife, Tara, left him and took their two children, he lost his job at an Allentown, Pa., amusement park and began a series of dark posts containing explicit references to violence against his wife, co-workers, kindergartners, police and the FBI.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Sometimes, he imitated rap lyrics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Other times, he referred to his First Amendment rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>His lawyers said it was a form of therapy as well as art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Did you know that it's illegal for me to say I want to kill my wife?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Elonis wrote in one of many posts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"It's illegal. It's indirect criminal contempt. It's one of the only sentences that I'm not allowed to say."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The lengthy diatribe copied nearly word-for-word a satirical sketch by The Whitest Kids U' Know comedy troupe, concluding with Elonis' own summation: "Art is about pushing limits. I'm willing to go to jail for my constitutional rights. Are you?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Elonis' attorneys said he never intended to carry out his violent threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>On the Internet, they said, context is lost and words can be misinterpreted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The government said the standard used by lower courts - that Elonis' words on Facebook could be viewed as threats by a reasonable person reading them - was sufficient, and his intent did not have to be proved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"Juries are fully capable of distinguishing between metaphorical expression of strong emotions and statements that have the clear sinister meaning of a threat," its brief said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Rap music has thrived under the "reasonable person" standard, it noted, without ensnaring popular rappers such as Eminem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The government was backed by groups such as the National Network to End Domestic Violence, which cited a survey of 759 victims' service agencies that found nearly 90% of them had cases of threats delivered via technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Text messages were the most prevalent form, followed by social media and e-mail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Women between the ages of 18 and 24 were the most frequent targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The current Supreme Court has been a strong defender of free speech rights, going so far as to permit distasteful protests at military funerals and online videos depicting animal torture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>But it also has drawn lines, ruling last term against the free speech rights of a previously convicted military protester and opponents of then-President George W. Bush who were moved from their protest site by the Secret Service.</td></tr>
