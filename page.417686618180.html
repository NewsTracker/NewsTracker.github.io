<h3>Greek state broadcaster recast with old ERT name, staff</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's state broadcaster has resumed operations under its old ERT name, and is proposing to rehire all staff fired in a cost-cutting, efficiency-boosting drive two years ago when the company was briefly closed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Reinstating the broadcaster's name and full workforce was a key pledge of Greece's new radical left-led government, which campaigned strongly against the closure in June 2013 by the previous, conservative government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>ERT was later replaced by a slimmed-down version called NERIT, but its abrupt closure angered many Greeks and drew international protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The government hailed Thursday's first broadcasts under the new name as a "victory for democracy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It is still unclear how much the new company will cost, and how many people it will employ.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The old ERT was widely criticized for political nepotism and profligate spending.</td></tr>
