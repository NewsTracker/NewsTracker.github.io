<h3>Lily James is living a fairytale life with starring role in 'Cinderella'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The British actress had spent most of her young acting life in smaller roles, from films like "Wrath of the Titans" and the TV shows "Secret Diary of a Call Girl" and "Just William."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Then two big breaks came her way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She was cast as the spunky Lady Rose in "Downton Abbey," a series that has been a massive hit for the BBC and PBS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In the middle of all that attention, she landed a film role that has turned her into a movie star.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She plays "Cinderella" in the new live-action film about a young girl with a good heart, a stepmother with a lust for power and a prince with a shoe obsession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I'm here, in L.A., with my mum and my brothers. Tonight, there's this Hollywood premiere and so all of that really, truly feels like a fairytale," James says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"A role like this has all this magic around it because it's Disney, it's a princess, it's a fairytale. I feel so, so lucky."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She credits director Kenneth Branagh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He could have made the story cheesy with its mice, transforming lizards and a fairy godmother who is a few handfuls of pixie dust short of a spell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But he made the film a sweet love story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Branagh feels lucky to have found James.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He had a long list of qualities he wanted in Cinderella: She had to be witty, smart and sharp, but not cruel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Inner and outer beauty were musts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He saw all of that when James auditioned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She sees "Cinderella" as a story about two people from different backgrounds who meet and fall in love.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She laughs and says it was easy to be lovestruck by Richard Madden, who is both as charming as his prince and "a little bit naughty."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The pair got along from the first day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>James was impressed that when she burped in his face after drinking a warm soda too fast, he was not offended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I think when people are doing a love story the work can get complicated. But, this was so uncomplicated," James says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We were just good friends and that made it easy to do the scenes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Another thing that made the work so easy was the beautiful wardrobe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>James' favorite dress was the pink gown Cinderella sews from one of her mother's gowns because of the sentimental attachment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Although she considers Cinderella a role of a lifetime, the princess was not her favorite growing up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>She identified with Belle, from "Beauty and the Beast."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I also liked Belle's spirit of adventure and wanting more. Growing up, I liked the characters who dreamed more and wanted more. The animated version of Cinderella was more about the Prince saving her," James says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But, she didn't limit herself to Belle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Her grandmother would make her princess outfits to wear around the house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The greatest challenge of playing Cinderella ended up being the pressure she put on herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"It wasn't just a fear of ruining Cinderella for everyone in the world, because everybody has such a clear image of her whether it's from the storybook world, their imagination or the animation," James says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"I think every little girl wants to be a princess but the reality of actually doing it, and believing you can do it, that was the challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"I ended up not thinking of her as a princess, but simply as Ella."</td></tr>
