<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Grand jury indicts Baltimore police in death of Freddie Gray Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A grand jury has brought charges against six Baltimore police officers in the death of Freddie Gray from injuries suffered while in police custody, Baltimore City State Attorney Marilyn Mosby told a news conference on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Gray's death on April 19 set off weeks of largely peaceful protests in Baltimore punctuated by a day of rioting and arson after his funeral on April 27, when rioters threw rocks at police and set buildings and cars on fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The grand jury's findings, including one count of second-degree depraved heart murder against officer Caesar Goodson Jr., were largely in line with the charges that Mosby announced early this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The officers will be arraigned on July 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"These past two weeks, my team has been presenting evidence to a grand jury that just today returned indictments against all six officers," Mosby told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She took no questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The death of Gray, 25, followed a string of police-involved deaths of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, New York City and North Charleston, South Carolina, which provoked waves of protests across the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The grand jury also charged Goodson, police officers William Porter, Edward Nero and Garret Miller, Lieutenant Brian Rice and Sergeant Alicia White with reckless endangerment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The grand jury did not bring charges of false imprisonment against Rice and Nero, charges that Mosby had pursued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Fraternal Order of Police union, which represents the officers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released photos on Thursday of several people suspected of setting fires during the April 27 rioting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They included a man suspected of torching a CVS pharmacy, where arson and looting became a symbol of the unrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Authorities are offering $10,000 rewards in the cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The ATF has investigated the torching of six stores and a seniors' center under construction, it said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Baltimore Fire Department has said 61 structural fires were recorded over April 27 and 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In addition, 144 vehicles were set on fire, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's office has said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken after the protests in Baltimore, 69 percent of respondents said America had a serious issue with race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Nearly three-quarters said there was more racism in the United States than the country was willing to admit.</td></tr>
