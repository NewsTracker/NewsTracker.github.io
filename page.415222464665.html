<h3>Latest poll of voters reveals TV characters they associate with party leaders</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The poll, commissioned by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft also saw Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg likened to Fred from Scooby Doo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The survey comes as the poll that a study of marginal constituencies suggests Labour and the Conservatives are heading for electoral 'deadlock' in May, with neither party able to govern.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It also revealed that a dramatic surge by the SNP looks set to claim Gordon Brown's seat and rob Labour of a Commons majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It suggests the Scottish nationalists are on course for a landslide in May, winning as many as 56 of Scotland's 59 seats - up from just six at present.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The SNP surge would claim seats held by a string of household names, including Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Tories are also in danger of losing their one Scottish seat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The poll suggests that Labour and the Conservatives will be tied on 272 seats each - well short of the 326 needed to command a Commons majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Lord Ashcroft said the astonishing surge by the SNP in the wake of last year's independence referendum had thrown a 'giant spanner in Labour's works'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The poll suggests a weak Ed Miliband government propped up by the Scottish nationalists could be likely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The two parties would have a combined total of 328 seats - producing a Commons majority of just three.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who is planning a return to Westminster, could become deputy prime minister in any deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His party has ruled out supporting the Conservatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>And it has warned that it will demand a ruinously high price from Labour, including billions more in spending and borrowing, home rule for Scotland and the scrapping of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gordon Brown's Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat, where the former prime minister is stepping down, currently has one of the biggest Labour majorities in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the new poll forecasts an incredible 28.5 per cent swing to the SNP, giving the nationalists a comfortable six-point lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In Edinburgh South West, where former chancellor Alistair Darling is also stepping down, the poll predicts an SNP win with a 22 per cent swing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Scottish nationalists are also set to win Ross, Skye and Lochaber, which Mr Kennedy has held since 1983.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>New Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is forecast to cling on in East Renfrewshire - but he could be one of only two Labour MPs remaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Polling was also conducted in a number of marginal seats in England and Wales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Tories are set to hold on in Vale of Glamorgan as well as Colne Valley, West Yorkshire, where they are narrowly ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But Labour is edging towards victory in two other Tory-held marginals - Norwich North and High Peak, in Derbyshire.</td></tr>

<h3>Refugees flee Boko Haram violence in Nigeria by boat as jihadist group steps up violence</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Her husband was nowhere to be found, and so she pulled her 4-year-old son onto her back and grabbed her two little girls by the hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 30-year-old pregnant woman ran as fast as she could to escape the Jan. 3 attack on her hometown of Baga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was one of the worst massacres ever carried out by Boko Haram during its five-year insurgency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The jihadist group seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate is believed to have killed hundreds that January day, and Abakar still doesn't know whether her husband is among the dead more than two months later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Three of her other children disappeared in the chaos that ensued as the militants opened fire indiscriminately and threw people into the burning homes that had been set ablaze.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The family made its way four hours on foot, and by the time she got to the shores of Lake Chad to board a boat to safety in neighboring Chad, she was too far along in her labor to get in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She gave birth in Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As soon as Aboubakar was born, she and the children got into a boat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"If I had stayed there they would have killed me too," she said softly inside a tent at a refugee camp now home to more than 6,000 Nigerians who have fled Boko Haram's violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Abakar and her children arrived this week at the camp after taking refuge in several other villages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The camp on the edge of the Sahara Desert is jointly run by the UN and the Chadian government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As she sat breastfeeding Aboubakar, her older children played on the sandy floor, their cheerful voices drowned out by the wind rattling the tarp overhead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She hopes her husband will approve of the name she chose for him so he could get identity documents as a newborn refugee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There was no naming ceremony, no father was present to buy a sheep to slaughter in sacrifice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She named the child after his grandfather - for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Many here hope their loved ones are not dead, but rather among those still hiding on the dozens of islands that dot Lake Chad which borders Chad, Nigeria and parts of Cameroon and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Chadian military tries to protect those fleeing here but even so, several weeks ago, Boko Haram militants aboard motorized boats attacked the peninsula of N'gouboua inside Chad, killing at least eight civilians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Since then, families have been brought from there to the camp where UNICEF offers health service and school and activities for the children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The families receive food from humanitarian agencies and are assigned tents erected in neat blocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They seek shade from the desert sun under acacia trees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Refugees take water from a well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Men riding camels through the region also come to the well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Chadian authorities believe more than 2,000 people remain trapped on islands, awaiting transport to a refugee camp in one of the world's poorest countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Some 100,000 Nigerians have fled to in neighboring Niger, with roughly another 60,000 in Cameroon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mahamat Abakar, 60, last saw his wife and eight children two months ago as they divided themselves between two small wooden boats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Upon arriving at this refugee camp, he was told that one of his sons was here too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>When he saw him, he sobbed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The 10-year-old said the boat he was on was sinking and the man paddling it ordered him and another child out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>They clung onto tree branches until people in another boat spotted them and brought them to safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>As a Muslim, the father has only anger for people who claim they are carrying out attacks in the name of Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"There is no passage in the Quran that says you can kill someone and steal their belongings and then kidnap their children," he said, wiping his eyes with a sandy scrap of fabric.</td></tr>
