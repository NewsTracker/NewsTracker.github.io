<h3>Sensation of 'Dope' continues at Cannes Film Festival</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - A year ago, writer-director Rick Famuyiwa was struggling to find financing for his film after studios in Hollywood passed on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Now, he's sitting in a restaurant at Cannes riding the sensation of "Dope," his comic Los Angeles coming-of-age tale that sparked a bidding war this year at the Sundance Film Festival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It's pretty freaking awesome," Famuyiwa says, tipping back his white fedora.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Here we are less than a year later. It's been crazy from Sundance to here. I haven't quite gotten any perspective on it yet, but I'm enjoying the moment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Dope" premiered Friday in the Cannes Film Festival's Directors' Fortnight section with most of its young cast enthusiastically in tow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It's a large group, including star newcomer Shameik Moore, Zoe Kravitz, ASAP Rocky, Tony Revolori and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While many indies that make it to Cannes arrive with a small retinue, "Dope" is here in full force - and some cast members even paid their own way to come.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Dope" is a buoyant, stereotype-busting high-school movie about a geek (Moore) in Inglewood, California, who's aiming to get into Harvard but is thrust into a rollicking adventure when drug dealers looking for a hiding place stuff his backpack full of Ecstasy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The close bond between the cast comes partly out of the unlikeliness of their journey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Dope" was made last summer in a rapid 24-day shoot around Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We were making something we all believe in," says Famuyiwa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"When people first read the script, they were like: 'This is crazy. What's going on here? " says Famuyiwa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It was tough to get people to see it. I felt like once it got made, people would get it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>When "Dope," the fourth film by the 41-year-old Famuyiwa ("The Wood," ''Our Family Wedding"), premiered at Sundance in January, it was the hit of the festival. It was snapped up by Open Road Films for a reported $7 million and many of those who turned it down before filming were now beating down Famuyiwa's door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Most of the same people who were there at Sundance were people who had seen the script before and they didn't get it," says Famuyiwa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Dope" has some heavyweight support: Pharrell Williams and Forest Whitaker are producers and Williams penned four songs for the movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Open Road isn't giving it the small, platform release most films out of Sundance aspire to, but a wide opening on June 19 in the heart of the summer movie season opposite Pixar's "Inside Out."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Dope" may be small in comparison to its opening weekend competition but it has something other films don't, says Famuyiwa.</td></tr>
