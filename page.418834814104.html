<h3>Hillary Clinton Focuses On Renewable Energy In Climate Change Plan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON -- In an ambitious climate change plan, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton pledged to make sure every American home is powered by renewable energy by 2027 if elected president and install half a billion solar panels around the country before the end of her first term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Her campaign released a copy of the plan Sunday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Clinton spoke about climate change at two campaign events in Iowa earlier in the day, telling supporters that climate change deniers are "just not paying attention."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Those people on the other side, they will answer any question about climate change by saying, 'I'm not a scientist.' Well, I'm not a scientist either. I'm just a grandmother with two eyes and a brain," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton's proposal also calls for promoting tax credits to incentivize a push toward renewable energy and away from coal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We can make a transition over time from a fossil fuel economy, predominantly, to a clean renewable energy economy, predominantly," she said on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton plans to address these proposals in more detail at an event on Monday, according to her campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The plan is a preview of more specific policy positions that she will announce in the coming months, which will include a Clean Energy Challenge involving competitive grants for states and municipalities to develop and implement renewable energy solutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On Sunday evening, environmental groups such as the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters quickly issued statements applauding Clinton's plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Climate change activist Tom Steyer endorsed Clinton's plan in a statement, calling her "a strong leader in solving the climate crisis."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I look forward to other candidates laying out aggressive plans to tackle climate change head-on. It's time for all leaders to acknowledge the problem our country faces and engage in a robust debate about the best way to tackle climate change and build a clean energy economy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The billionaire founder of NextGen Climate, who hosted a Clinton fundraiser at his San Francisco home in May, called for all of the presidential candidates to develop concrete plans to increase clean energy usage.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>Responding to Clinton, his campaign noted Sunday that as governor of Maryland, he doubled the state's renewable fuel production and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent.</td></tr>
