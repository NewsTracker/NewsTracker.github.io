<h3>Palestinians to push forth with bid to oust Israel from FIFA</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The head of the Palestine Football Association says he is pressing forth with his bid to oust Israel from FIFA despite efforts from its president to diffuse the crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA President Sepp Blatter was recently in the region on a self-described "mission of peace" to resolve tensions between the two sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Palestinians say Israeli security restrictions are limiting the movement of Palestinian players, visiting teams and equipment and have put forward a proposal to suspend Israel from world soccer at the 209-nation FIFA meeting on May 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Blatter opposes the suspension vote, saying Israel has not broken FIFA statutes in a political issue outside of soccer's control.</td></tr>
