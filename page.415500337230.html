<h3>Apple Watch may be a tough sell with Americans: 69% not interested in buying the gadget, new poll shows</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>However, the survey also showed limited awareness of the watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The poll was taken after Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook rolled out the product on Monday, and only about half of respondents said they had heard news of the timepiece in the last few days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>As the release of Apple Watch looms, Swiss watchmakers are remembering the '70s - the 'Quartz crisis,' when watch brands were slow to adapt to new technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Keep reading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Also, in an encouraging sign for Apple, roughly 13% of survey respondents who did not own an iPhone said that they would consider buying one in order to buy an Apple Watch, which needs an iPhone to work fully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apple overcame skepticism about the iPad and iPod when they first debuted, but the survey suggests that the world's largest technology company has work to do to make the watch ubiquitous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The new watch, a test of Cook's leadership, is the company's first new product in five years, and it hits stores on April 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It allows users to check email, listen to music and make phone calls from their wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple will sell various versions, from a US$349 'sport' edition to a US$17,000 18-karat gold timepiece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ipsos surveyed 1,245 Americans online between March 9 and March 13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The data was weighted to reflect the U.S. population and has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the poll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>More than half of respondents, 52%, agreed with the statement that smartwatches are a "passing fad."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>One-quarter of respondents said they were interested in purchasing the Apple Watch, but 69% said they had no desire, and 6% said they were unsure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Initial demand for the watch is expected to come primarily from existing iPhone users, but its wider success is seen depending on whether developers create enticing apps tailored to the device, so-called killer apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Apple is among several large tech companies looking to jumpstart a new market for "wearable" electronic devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But consumers have yet to cotton to the notion of wearable devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Google recently halted sales to consumers of Glass, a US$1,500 screen attached to glasses which were routinely mocked for their awkward appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Roughly 4.6 million smartwatches were sold globally in 2014, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, a fraction of the more than 1 billion smartphones sold worldwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Many in the tech industry hope that Apple, famous for its marketing savvy and loyal fans, will have the power to transform the smartwatches into a product that appeals to the general public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Some 46% of respondents said that the Apple Watch had a "cool factor."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But only 29% said they were more interested in purchasing an Apple Watch than another brand of smartwatch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Analysts expect that Apple will sell between 10 million and 32 million watches in 2015.</td></tr>

<h3>FOMC: Less Patience, Still Cautious</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The mystery of the FOMC meeting is whether the decision is made to drop "patience" from the statement and thereby set up for a June first step.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In her testimony to Congress, Yellen reminded those who were listening rather than wondering what was up with all her meetings with the Secretary of the Treasury that less patience doesn't automatically mean the Fed is ready to turn what the market is pricing into reality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The critical trigger for action remains inflation, of which there is unlikely to be any by June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Other items on the list that could make them go would be signs of accelerating wage growth, and/or improved growth in activity - meaning residential construction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the next three months we very much doubt there will be enough of an explosion in job growth outside of restaurants and health care in areas where higher wages reside, to generate aggregate wage increases the Fed would like to see - let alone employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This leaves the economy's upturn to the spring home buying season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It should be a plus for the economy, whether it is enough of one to move the Fed is another story, but it is does necessitate the Fed waiting until at least June to assess where the economy is, or isn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>For our perspective, the Fed likely drops patient from its statement, but their caution remains in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The reasons are twofold - the dollar and market liquidity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A lot of people, including some sitting around the FOMC table, downplay the impact of a stronger dollar on the US economy - nothing could be further from the truth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Imports of goods, aside from oil, has been steadily rising as a percent of US spending by consumers and business on goods excluding oil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It was 12% in 1972, 17% by 1982, 24% in 1992, 32% in 2002, and near 40% when the recession began.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The rise closely ties to the rise in the dollar's value to the world's currencies - on a trade-weighted basis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There has been a ceiling of late on the percent of imports, aided by the dollar's decline and abetted by QE.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The dollar's drop shifted terms of trade in favor of domestic production for domestic consumption and export.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The shift is also what the one the world's central banks are now leaning hard to reverse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>After all, the global economy has been fed for over 40 years by satisfying an increasing portion of US demand non-petroleum goods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Market liquidity is yet another factor the Fed needs to account for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In the drive to re-regulate the financial sector, the level of assets held by broker/dealers has dropped sharply from near 11% of total credit market debt outstanding when the recession began to just under 6% when 2014 came to a close.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The volume of credit market debt relative to GDP has dropped as well, but not by nearly as much - from around 3.6 times GDP to just under 3.2 times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>To keep this comparison fair, we subtract out Treasurys held by the Fed because these securities are unlikely to find their way into the capital markets anytime soon, if ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In sum, the Fed's long run with zero interest rates and QE have created a mix of unintended consequences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The equity market is priced like a bond, valuing cash to be returned rather than cash used to boost corporate net worth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The US economy reaped some benefit from the QE-induced weaker dollar, notably in the goods sector, but the rest of the world is now saying "no mas" just as Fed policy is presumed to shift to add to the dollar's gains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>US growth is most likely adversely impacted, thereby increasing the onus on residential real estate to keep up real growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The relative shrinkage of broker-dealer balance sheet liquidity also threatens to make any Fed move, especially a "surprise" some members favor, a higher volatility event with price dislocations in the capital markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The economy is growing, although probably not fast enough for the Fed to move in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Fed should announce it is less patient this week, in the name of giving them more flexibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It would, in our view, be a mistake to believe less patient means less cautious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Caution should drive the timing of their first step all the way to September - if then.</td></tr>
