<h3>Fraser-Holmes succumbs to swim pressure</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australian swimming coach Jacco Verhaeren says he will lean on comeback king Grant Hackett as he juggles a team with a remarkable 18-year age difference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The return of comeback king Grant Hackett could not have come at a better time for Australian head swimming coach Jacco Verhaeren.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It seems he will need all the advice he can get as he ponders whether world champion James Magnussen's controversial coaching switch has been the right one ahead of July's world titles in Kazan, Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Verhaeren admitted it would be a challenge to manage a Dolphins outfit with ages ranging from 16-year-old sprint sensation Kyle Chalmers to veteran Hackett - 18 years his senior.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, Verhaeren claimed he would pick Hackett's brain ahead of the worlds after the dual Olympic champion completed one of the great comebacks by sealing a team berth in his first major meet since the 2008 Olympics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's fantastic. It's great to have someone of his status, his name, in the team," Verhaeren said of Hackett who will inspire the 4x200m relay team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I am curious what he has to say about the team because he can actually relate to the team of the past - which I was not a part of - and what it looks like now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And Verhaeren looks like he needs a shoulder to lean on with the jury still out on Magnussen's heavily scrutinised call to ditch the man who led him to two world titles - Brant Best - before national titles in Sydney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Magnussen produced well below his best when upstaged by Cameron McEvoy in the 100m final and will be kept honest by the emergence of teen sensation Chalmers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Magnussen believed he was on track to win a record third straight 100m world title in Kazan with a confidence-boosting national 50m win in Sydney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Yet, Verhaeren sounded like he needed a bit more convincing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"First, we have to be happy that he has made the team," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"He achieved his goal to be able to defend his world title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But it's obvious he needs to be able to improve to do that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Asked if he believed Magnussen had made the right choice by linking with unknown mentors Mitch and Lach Falvey, Verhaeren said: "It's the right mix because he chose it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We respect an athlete's choice - and we will find out in the future whether it was the best possible choice."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Australian team has reverted to the Dolphins name after a dramatic turnaround in and out of the pool since the London Olympic debacle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But Verhaeren did not believe they had taken a step backwards despite just five team members holding world No.1 rankings - albeit across nine events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They are Cameron McEvoy (100m freestyle), Mack Horton (400m, 1500m freestyle), Cate Campbell (50m, 100m freestyle), Emily Seebohm (50m, 100, 200m backstroke) and Madeline Groves (200m butterfly).</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Meanwhile, Bronte Campbell finally turned the tables on world champion sister Cate Campbell on Friday night in the 50m freestyle final at the national championships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Bronte Campbell (24.19) notched her maiden Australian title - and winning over her older sibling (24.33).</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Cate Campbell - back from off-season shoulder surgery - is still unbeaten over 100m since late 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mack Horton broke Hackett's 16-year-old 18-year age record by almost five seconds when he clocked a personal best 14.44.09 to defend his 1500m freestyle title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Other winners on the final night were Thomas Fraser-Holmes (men's 400m IM), Keryn McMaster (women's 400m IM), Leiston Pickett (50m breaststroke) and Ben Treffers (50m backstroke).</td></tr>
