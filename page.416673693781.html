<h3>A-Rod ties Mays for 4th with 660 HRs; Yanks top Red Sox 3-2 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BOSTON (AP) -- Alex Rodriguez tied Willie Mays for fourth place in major league history with his 660th home run, breaking an eighth-inning tie with a pinch-hit shot that sent the New York Yankees to a 3-2 win over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yankees manager Joe Girardi left Rodriguez out of the starting lineup to rest, but sent him up to bat for Garrett Jones with one out in the eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Rodriguez ran the count to 3-0, then lined a fastball from Junichi Tazawa (0-1) into the left-field seats above the Green Monster - his first career homer as a pinch hitter - and jogged around the bases to boos from the crowd at Fenway Park, where he made his major league debut with Seattle in 1994.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''I really like this place,'' Rodriguez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mays saluted Rodriguez in a statement released by the San Francisco Giants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''Congratulations to Alex Rodriguez on his 660th home run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Milestones in baseball are meant to be broken and I wish him continued success throughout his career,'' the Hall of Famer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Yankees' reaction was a bit subdued for a teammate who was suspended all last season for his involvement in the Biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Players stayed in the dugout, applauding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But when A-Rod arrived, Girardi gave him a high-five and teammates shook his hand and enthusiastically patted him on the back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Asked how fans should remember No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>660, Rodriguez said: ''I don't know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I know that I'm very excited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A year ago today I never thought I'd be hitting home runs and helping the Yankees win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The milestone homer could set up a legal showdown with the team over a $6 million payment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Rodriguez and the Yankees have a $30 million marketing agreement that calls for payments of $6 million each for up to five accomplishments, payable within 15 days of designation by the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The accomplishments were contemplated to be home runs 660, 714, 755, 762 and 763.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Yankees, though, are thinking about letting the milestones pass without making a designation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Due to his drug suspension, the marketing possibilities for the milestones have been ruined, the Yankees appear to be set to argue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Still, only three players have hit more homers than Rodriguez - Barry Bonds (762), Hank Aaron (755) and Babe Ruth (714).</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Rodriguez's sixth homer this season came after he had struggled over his previous 10 games, going 5 for 37 with one homer and two RBIs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>His 659th came on Sunday, but he was 0 for 6 in his most recent game with four strikeouts and a game-ending double play in a 3-2 loss in 13 innings to the Tampa Bay Rays on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''I haven't been very good in my career pinch hitting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>I don't have a lot of experience,'' Rodriguez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''Joe had a conversation with me early this spring and he wanted us to take 3-0 swinging a little bit more serious, be a little bit more assertive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Esmil Rogers (1-1) got the win by pitching a scoreless seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Andrew Miller worked a perfect ninth for his ninth save.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>With right-hander Justin Masterson starting for Boston, the Yankees had six lefties and three switch-hitters in the starting lineup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Rodriguez bats right-handed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Yankees scored in the first on an RBI double by Carlos Beltran after a single by Jacoby Ellsbury and a walk to Mark Teixeira.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Red Sox tied it in the third when Xander Bogaerts doubled, took third on a flyout by Ryan Hanigan and scored on a sacrifice fly by Mookie Betts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Allen Craig's first homer of the season in just his sixth start put Boston ahead 2-1 in the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Then New York tied it at 2 in the seventh when Didi Gregorius walked, went to second when Teixeira was hit by a pitch and scored on a single by Brian McCann.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>CC Sabathia had a solid outing after losing his four other starts this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>He gave up two runs and seven hits in six innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Masterson allowed two runs on six hits in six innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Yankees: LHP Chris Capuano and RHP Ivan Nova are expected to throw Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Both are on the disabled list - Capuano with a strained right quadriceps and Nova while recovering from right elbow surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Red Sox: Hanigan left in the seventh after hurting his right hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>A pitch from Tommy Layne hit Teixeira on his right wrist and the ball ricocheted off Hanigan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Teixeira and Hanigan both flung their arms in pain simultaneously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Teixeira stayed in the game but Hanigan was replaced by Sandy Leon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Yankees: RHP Nathan Eovaldi (1-0, 4.15 ERA) pitches the second game of the three-game series Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The Yankees acquired him in December from Miami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The Marlins had Eovaldi him from Los Angeles in a July 2012 deal that sent current Red Sox LF Hanley Ramirez to the Dodgers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Red Sox: LHP Wade Miley (1-2, 8.62) tries to bounce back from his second start this season in which he failed to get out of the third inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>He gave up seven runs in 2 1-3 innings Sunday in an 18-7 loss at Baltimore.</td></tr>
