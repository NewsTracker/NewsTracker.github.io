<h3>Greek bailout talks to shift gear</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras holds a bottle of water as he is surrounded by photographers during a meeting of ruling radical left Syriza party's central committee in Athens, on Thursday, July 30, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tsipras called for an extraordinary party congress in September, after Greece is expected to seal a new bailout deal with its international creditors, in a bid to end a rebellion by his hardline lawmakers that is threatening to topple his coalition government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Lead negotiators from the European Union and International Monetary Fund begin an intensive round of talks with Greece on Friday to hammer out details of a third international bailout worth some 85 billion euros ($93 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece needs the money to keep paying its debts and remain in the euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The envoys are to meet Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos following talks during the week in Athens between lower-level officials on reforming the tax system and labor market regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The bailout talks must be concluded before Aug. 20, when a debt repayment to the European Central Bank worth more than 3 billion euros is due.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tsakalotos will meet officials from the IMF, European Commission, European Central Bank and European Stability Mechanism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It comes hours after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras defeated a bid by dissenters in his left-wing Syriza party to push for an end to bailout negotiations and seek a return to the old national currency, the drachma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The party's governing central committee early Friday backed a proposal by Tsipras to hold an emergency party conference in September, after the talks have been concluded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dissenters had sought a conference earlier, pressing the government to abandon the negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tsipras effectively lost his majority in parliament in a vote three weeks ago, when nearly one-fourth of Syriza's lawmakers refused to back new austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Pro-European Union opposition parties were left to save the bill and have continued to prop up his government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have to agree that we can't go on this way," Tsipras told the committee members during a dramatic 12-hour meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He added that "the absurdity of this strange and unprecedented dualism" within the party must stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Far-left dissenters argue that Syriza has abandoned its principles over the past six months under the country's popular prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They have openly voiced support for Greece to turn its back on the euro as its national currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"This country no long has democracy, but a peculiar type of totalitarianism - a dictatorship of the euro," prominent dissenter Panagiotis Lafazanis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The third bailout will include a new punishing round of austerity measures heaped on a country reeling from a six-year recession and more than 25 percent unemployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Also on Friday, Tsipras is due to appear in parliament to answer qustions from the opposition about contingency plans to adopt a parallel payment system that could have facilitated a euro exit.</td></tr>
