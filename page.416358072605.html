<h3>Video: Islamic State kills Ethiopian Christians in Libya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>EDS NOTE: GRAPHIC CONTENT - This undated image made from a video released by Islamic State militants, Sunday, April 19, 2015, appears to show the killing of a group of captured Ethiopian Christians in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 29-minute video released online Sunday purportedly shows two groups of captives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It says one group is held by an IS affiliate in eastern Libya and the other by an affiliate in the south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A masked fighter delivers a long statement before the video switches between footage that purportedly shows the captives in the south being shot dead and the captives in the east being beheaded on a beach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - Islamic State militants in Libya shot and beheaded groups of captive Ethiopian Christians, a video purportedly from the extremists showed Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The attack widens the circle of nations affected by the group's atrocities while showing its growth beyond a self-declared "caliphate" in Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The release of the 29-minute video comes a day after Afghanistan's president blamed the extremists for a suicide attack in his country that killed at least 35 people - and underscores the chaos gripping Libya after its 2011 civil war and the killing of dictator Moammar Gadhafi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It also mirrored a film released in February showing militants beheading 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a Libyan beach, which immediately drew Egyptian airstrikes on the group's suspected positions in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Whether Ethiopia would - or could - respond with similar military force remains unclear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ethiopia long has drawn the anger of Islamic extremists over its military's attacks on neighboring Somalia, whose population is almost entirely Muslim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While the militant in the video at one point said "Muslim blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap," it did not specifically mention the Ethiopian government's actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The video, released via militant social media accounts and websites, could not be independently verified by The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However, it corresponded to other videos released by the Islamic State group and bore the symbol of its al-Furqan media arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The video starts with what it called a history of Christian-Muslim relations, followed by scenes of militants destroying churches, graves and icons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A masked fighter brandishing a pistol delivers a long statement, saying Christians must convert to Islam or pay a special tax prescribed by the Quran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It shows one group of captives, identified as Ethiopian Christians, purportedly held by an Islamic State affiliate in eastern Libya known as Barqa Province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It also shows another purportedly held by an affiliate in the southern Libyan calling itself the Fazzan Province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The video then switches between footage of the captives in the south being shot dead and the captives in the east being beheaded on a beach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It was not immediately possible to estimate how many captives were killed or confirm their identities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In Ethiopia, government spokesman Redwan Hussein said officials were in contact with its embassy in Cairo to verify the video's authenticity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Hussein said he believed those killed likely were Ethiopian migrants hoping to reach Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Libya has become a hub for migrants across Africa hoping to cross the Mediterranean to enter Europe for work and better lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"If this is confirmed, it will be a warning to people who wish to risk and travel to Europe though the dangerous route," Hussein said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Abba Kaletsidk Mulugeta, an official with the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church's Patriarchate Office, told the AP he also believed the victims likely were migrants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I believe this is just another case of the IS group killing Christians in the name of Islam. Our fellow citizens have just been killed on a faith-based violence that is totally unacceptable. This is outrageous," Mulugeta said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"No religion orders the killing of other people, even people from another religion."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>After the February killings of the Coptic Christians, Egypt's military responded with airstrikes targeting the militant stronghold of Darna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It has not launched further strikes, though its president is trying to form a pan-Arab military force to respond to extremist threats in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Islamic State group, which grew out of al-Qaida's former Iraqi affiliate, now holds about a third of Iraq and Syria in its self-declared caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>It's called on Muslims across the world to join it.</td></tr>
