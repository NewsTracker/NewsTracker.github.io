<h3>Souths halves not concerned by big hits</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>South Sydney's diminutive, premiership-winning halves Adam Reynolds and Luke Keary have dismissed suggestions playmakers are being targeted more than ever in the NRL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>North Queensland called for better protection for playmakers after witnessing treatment meted out to Johnathan Thurston by Newcastle on Saturday, when the Test superstar copped several heavy knocks and finished the game unable to see out of one eye.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Knights enforcer Beau Scott pleaded guilty to a grade one dangerous contact charge for one late high shot on Thurston, escaping suspension - an outcome that caused outrage north of the Tweed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Former great Andrew Johns claimed on Sunday that skilful players were being targeted more than ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the 182cm Keary, who weighs in at 82kg, said he didn't expect any special treatment from referees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"If you want to take the ball to the line you have to expect to get hit," Keary told AAP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"If you don't want to get hit, don't take the ball to the line. It's rugby league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's always been that way and will continue to be. You know what to expect. I've not been hit any more now than before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I haven't been the victim of any cheap shots and I honestly haven't seen anyone do it in the NRL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Big Sammy Moa at the Roosters got me good at the weekend but it wasn't anything more than a strong tackle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's part of the game and as long as you don't dish out anything illegal or cheap then you have to take it on the chin."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Reynolds, just a centimetre taller than Keary and three kilos heavier, spent 11 minutes out of the game for a concussion test after being caught accidentally by the knee of Aidan Guerra in Sunday's win over the Sydney Roosters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He returned to lead the team to a come-from-behind 34-26 victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He echoed the sentiments of his halves partner and said being hit by big forwards was simply an occupational hazard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's just part of the game for me. We get hit a lot, you get up and you move on," Reynolds told AAP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's just what happens when you take on the line but that's our job and you take one for the team when you have to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I try not to worry about it, if you get hit, you get hit. I just worry about my game that's enough for me to think about."</td></tr>

<h3>Super Mario to go mobile as Nintendo ventures into smartphone games</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nintendo, which already warned its annual operating profit would halve on weak console sales, said on Tuesday it was teaming up with online gaming firm DeNA Co Ltd to develop and operate gaming apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The two companies will also launch later this year an online membership service accessible on mobile devices as well as Nintendo's existing Wii U console and the portable 3DS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"This will allow us to build a bridge between smart devices and gaming consoles," Nintendo President Satoru Iwata told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It doesn't mean smart devices will eat away at gaming consoles, it will create an entirely new type of demand."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company had so far resisted these calls, pinning its hopes on hit games such as "Mario Kart 8".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But in January, it halved its operating earnings target for the fiscal year through March to 20 billion yen ($169 million), citing weak 3DS sales in the year-end holiday season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Under the parternship, Nintendo and DeNA would buy 22 billion yen worth of shares in each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As a result, Nintendo will acquire a 10 percent stake in DeNA while DeNA will acquire a 1.2 percent stake in Nintendo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Although Iwata didn't disclose any details about Nintendo's first mobile game, he said it would not be a hand-me-down from the company's famed console titles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He also said Nintendo was currently developing NX, a new gaming platform, but declined to give further details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>For DeNA, which grew from a startup launched in 1999 to a major online gaming company, a tie-up with Nintendo will help it regain momentum lost in the past two years as users moved on to more popular gaming apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>DeNA mainly develops games played on browsers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As a result of the capital alliance, Nintendo will become the second largest shareholder of DeNA after its founder, Tomoko Namba, who has a 13.1 percent stake.</td></tr>
