<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Stephen Curry practices tough shots every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The MVP came up with a third-quarter buzzer-beater his coach calls the play of the game.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>He said Curry was amazing, especially with that shot as the Grizzlies tried to make a run in the third quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''It wasn't quite a close-out shot, but it was the play of the game,'' Kerr said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Warriors advanced with some of the best shooting in the NBA postseason since 1985, becoming the first team since that year to hit 14 or more 3s in three consecutive playoff games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Curry was 8 of 13 from beyond the arc as the Warriors knocked down their playoff-best 15 3-pointers.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>Klay Thompson had 20 points for Golden State and Draymond Green added 16, Harrison Barnes 13 and Shaun Livingston 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Memphis coach Dave Joerger said he hadn't seen the replay of Curry's shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Grizzlies guard Mike Conley said he thought Green was fouled and that his teammates stopped playing, waiting for the call and then Curry threw up the shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''It was tough to realize and kind of grasp it all in the same time,'' Conley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Warriors will play the winner of the Los Angeles Clippers-Houston Rockets series in the conference finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>That series will start Tuesday night at Golden State.</td></tr>

<tr><td>28</td><td>''It's just one of those special moments,'' Grizzlies guard Tony Allen said of Curry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''He's a special kind of guy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>That stellar shooting helped the Warriors win a second series in the same postseason for the first time since capturing the title in 1975, and they never trailed in this game.</td></tr>

<tr><td>33</td><td>The Splash Brothers outscored the Grizzlies by themselves combining for 22 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But Curry and Thompson got plenty of help with teammates taking turns knocking down shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>''I think what you see with their team is I think that they really grew up,'' Joerger said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Memphis tried to rally, opening the third quarter with a 13-5 spurt with two free throws by Green pulling the Grizzlies within 63-62 with 3:59 left.</td></tr>

<tr><td>41</td><td>... They are 54-5 this season and postseason combined when making at least 10 3-pointers, including 7-0 these playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Grizzlies: Allen, who had 24 steals in his first nine playoff games, tried to play with the injured left hamstring that kept him out of Game 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>But he played only 5 minutes before going to the bench for the night, unable to move effectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>... Memphis had only three turnovers, the fewest ever in a playoff game against Golden State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The Lakers had six on March 31, 1969, against Golden State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>... Memphis is 4-2 all-time in Game 6s, losing its last two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The Grizzlies played a video tribute and held a moment of silence before the national anthem in memory of musician B.B. King, who died late Thursday at the age of 89.</td></tr>
