<h3>About time - Microsoft to ditch Internet Explorer brand</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Microsoft is finally ditching Internet Explorer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The software maker has confirmed that it will use a new name for its upcoming Windows 10 browser, The Verge reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But it hasn't decided on one yet - it's currently codenamed Project Spartan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>For years, Internet Explorer has been the browser the world loves to hate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After a series of security flaws and holes in the early 2000s, it developed a serious image problem and never fully recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We're now researching what the new brand, or the new name, for our browser should be in Windows 10," Chris Capossela said at Microsoft's Convergence event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We'll continue to have Internet Explorer, but we will also have a new browser called Project Spartan, which is code-named Project Spartan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We have to name the thing."</td></tr>
