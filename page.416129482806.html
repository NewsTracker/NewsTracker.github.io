<h3>Is Hillary Clinton announcing her candidacy soon?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Is Hillary Clinton announcing her presidential candidacy soon?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hillary Clinton will announce her candidacy for the presidency "as early as this weekend," the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter, and the Guardian said that the former secretary of state would declare she's in the race Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She is expected to travel to early-voting states soon after her announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Clinton has been quietly hiring staff for months, including top Obama and Clinton aide John Podesta and former Obama Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, and she reportedly just signed a lease for campaign headquarters in Brooklyn last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This will be Clinton's second run for the presidency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton's candidacy has practically been a foregone conclusion for months, and she would be the first Democrat to declare her candidacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The former secretary of state has been a clear frontrunner in the race that's still taking shape, although there are a few other Democrats considering a run, including former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb, and possibly Vice President Joe Biden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Thursday, former Rhode Island Governor and Senator Lincoln Chafee announced he was opening an exploratory committee to consider running as a Democrat, as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In an interview with CNN, he criticized Clinton saying, "Considering the premise for invading Iraq was based on falsehoods and considering the ramifications we live with now from that mistake, I would argue that anybody who voted for the Iraq War should not be president and certainly should not be leading the Democratic Party."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Clinton, unlike most of the other candidates and potential candidates, does not have any other fundraising mechanisms in place currently, although there are super PACs that have been supporting her candidacy for over a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She has a substantial network of donors, however, and will have almost an entire quarter to raise money before the first fundraising reports are due this summer.</td></tr>
