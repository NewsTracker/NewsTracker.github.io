<h3>Sydney cafe reopens 3 months after deadly siege</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Lindt Cafe's reopening comes three months after gunman Man Monis, an Iranian-born, self-styled cleric, took 18 people inside the cafe hostage and made a series of demands, including that he be delivered a flag of the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The standoff ended after police stormed the cafe in a barrage of gunfire, killing Monis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Two hostages were also killed; one by fragments of a police bullet, and one who was shot by Monis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Cafe worker Joel Herat, who survived the siege, was behind the counter when the doors opened, wearing his signature Lindt apron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It was extremely important for me to be here and support Lindt and support the people I work with," Herat told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. "Working with these people here, it's helped a lot in the healing process."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Plaques dedicated to the two victims, 38-year-old attorney Katrina Dawson and 34-year-old cafe manager Tori Johnson, were installed as permanent memorials inside the cafe, which was otherwise a festive spot on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hundreds of customers lined up to get inside, chefs stirred vats of molten chocolate and colorful clusters of chocolate Easter bunnies and other holiday treats crowded the shelves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Steve Loane, Lindt Australia's CEO, said in a statement that reopening the cafe was the right thing to do, and New South Wales state Premier Mike Baird said it symbolized the importance of moving forward.</td></tr>

<h3>Australian cyclone makes landfall, loses strength</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cyclone Nathan made landfall shortly before dawn as a category four system, the second highest intensity rating, and was expected to continue its westward movement inland while weakening, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The storm was downgraded by the bureau to a category three system at about 2200 GMT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At its peak, Nathan was packing sustained winds near the center of 130 km (85 miles) per hour with wind gusts to 189 km per hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters there have been no reports of injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The cyclone is expected to lose much of its punch over land, but meteorologists warned it could reform again if it reaches the warm waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria, 250 km (155 miles) from the coast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The archipelago nation of Vanuatu was devastated last weekend by Cyclone Pam, one of the strongest storms ever to hit the South Pacific.</td></tr>
