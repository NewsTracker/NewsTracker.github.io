<h3>Quake agony revealed quietly on trip from Nepal airport</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) - Soon after landing at Kathmandu airport, the Thai Airways captain made a bizarre announcement to passengers: Nobody is in the control tower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That meant we could taxi no farther, and we were trapped on the tarmac.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It took the pilot another half-hour to explain that air-traffic controller had left the tower because there had been an aftershock, one of several that has struck fear into this mountainous nation since Saturday's massive tremor killed more than 2,500 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Those moments and many others in my first hours in Nepal's capital revealed that while much of Kathmandu appears to have been spared physical damage from the earthquake, other signs of trauma are everywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>We waited while airport officials inspected the tarmac for damage and cracks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the back of the plane, an argument broke out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A Thai airways staffer was telling a Chinese businessman to get off his cellphone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I will not!" shouted Jun Sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I'm speaking to my family. This is important.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I need to know they are OK now. I need to know my wife and daughter are OK."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sun, who works in the telecommunications industry, said he was returning from a conference in Bangkok.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He tried to call his wife to find out how she and his 10-month-old daughter were, but could not get through because the network was so congested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He spoke to her "for a few seconds" on the Chinese social media service WeChat - it was just enough to know they were alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He pulled out his cellphone and showed several images of destroyed homes in Kathmandu that colleagues had sent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"This is what we are worried about," he said, pointing to a picture of a huge crack running up the side of the multi-story apartment building he lives in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>When our jet finally got the green light to move forward, well over an hour later, it taxied past a large Indian military cargo plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Soldiers stood on the tarmac, unloading supplies and trolleys filled with fuel - which Kathmandu residents say is running precariously low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On the walk into the airport, we could see hundreds of people, mostly tourists, crowded behind the glass walls of a terminal building, clearly hoping for a flight out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>One man's face was covered with large bandages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Flights also resumed - we saw a gray cargo plane hurtling above.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And in the parking lot outside the arrivals hall, no taxis waited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Instead, thousands of scared and frustrated Indian nationals stood in huge lines, hoping to get on evacuation flights their government was organizing.</td></tr>
