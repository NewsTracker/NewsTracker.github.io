<h3>Courtney Barnett, Live In Concert: SXSW 2015</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The song, like its counterparts on her early EPs, was many things - wordy, funny, surprising, wittily crafted - but it wasn't forceful.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>But Barnett also doubles down on her dense, intricate, wonderfully written wordplay, and loses none of her sublime quotability along the way.</td></tr>
