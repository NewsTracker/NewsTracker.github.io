<h3>Cyclone leaves trail of destruction</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cyclone Pam tore through the tiny South Pacific archipelago with winds of 270 kilometers (168 miles) per hour early on Saturday, leaving a trail of destruction and unconfirmed reports of dozens of deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Power remained out across Vanuatu throughout Saturday and people on many of the outer islands had no access to running water or outside communications, according to Chloe Morrison, a World Vision emergency communications officer in the capital Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ms Morrison said communications have been so problematic that her aid group has not yet been able to account for many of its own 76 staff on the islands and authorities have been unable to assess the extent of the damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I can say that for anybody who wasn't in a secure shelter last night, it would have been a very, very tough time for them," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 spread over 65 islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>About 47,000 people live in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ms Morrison said authorities did a good job of moving thousands of people in Port Vila into 23 evacuation centres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>With the winds and rain easing on Saturday, many people stepped out only to find that their homes were missing a roof or had disappeared, and were forced to return to the shelters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Teetering trees and downed power lines in Port Vila have made many areas hazardous, she said, adding that she had heard reports of entire villages being destroyed in more remote areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It's still really quite dangerous outside. Most people are still hunkering down," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Unicef estimated that 54,000 children were among those affected by the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the impact and scope of the disaster caused by the cyclone was not yet clear, but he feared the damage and destruction could be widespread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We hope the loss of life will be minimal," he said during the World Conference on Disaster Risk and Reduction in Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The UN said it was preparing to deploy emergency rapid response units.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, who was attending the conference, told participants: "I do not really know what impact the cyclone has had on Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I am speaking to you today with a heart that is so heavy. I stand to appeal on behalf of the government and the people to give a helping hand in this disaster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ms Morrison said the first priority was to ensure people had adequate food, drinking water and shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Beyond that, she said, there would need to be a long and concerted rebuilding effort in the months ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She said the winds peaked between about midnight on Friday and 1am on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A westward change of course put populated areas directly in the path of Cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said there were unconfirmed reports of 44 deaths in Vanuatu's northeastern islands after Pam moved off its expected track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>New Zealand has pledged one million New Zealand dollars ( 497,000) to help with relief efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Australia was preparing to send a crisis response team to Vanuatu if needed, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"There are destructive winds, rain, flooding, landslides, sea surges and very rough seas and the storm is exceedingly destructive there," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We are still assessing the situation, but we stand ready to assist."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The small island nation, located about a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii, has repeatedly warned it is already suffering devastating effects from climate change with the island's coastal areas being washed away, forcing resettlement to higher ground and smaller yields on traditional crops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Scientists say it is impossible to attribute single weather events like Cyclone Pam to climate change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The cyclone has already caused damage to other Pacific islands, including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Authorities in New Zealand are preparing for Cyclone Pam, which is forecast to pass north of the country on Sunday and Monday.</td></tr>

<h3>Friday's recap: Hornets 101, Bulls 91</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau yells at NBA official Haywoode Workman in the second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Charlotte Hornets' Bismack Biyombo (8) and the Chicago Bulls' Aaron Brooks (0) fight for control of the ball in the first half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bulls guard Aaron Brooks (0) shoots against the Charlotte Hornets in the second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Charlotte Hornets guard Kemba Walker, center, looks to pass out of a double-team by Chicago Bulls forwards Nikola Mirotic, left, and Aaron Brooks in the first half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Here's all you need to know about the Bulls' dismal 101-91 loss to the Hornets on Friday night: The Bulls set a season-high with 35 first-quarter points, shooting 70 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That included ridiculous 7-for-8 shooting from 3-point range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Then, in the third quarter, the Bulls shot 3-for-17 and posted a season-low for points in a quarter with 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Throw in dismal rebounding and the result is a bad loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gerald Henderson's 20 points led seven Hornets in double figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Aaron Brooks' 24 points paced the Bulls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Hornets opened the third quarter with a 13-3 run to erase an eight-point halftime deficit and take their first lead since 2-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>19-17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Take your pick between the Hornets' 55-36 rebounding advantage or a 27-10 edge in second-chance points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Joakim Noah recorded six assists, his ninth straight game with at least five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That matches Noah's career-high streak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Bismack Biyombo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On a night the Bulls should have enjoyed a huge advantage inside because of injuries to Hornets big men, Biyombo's energy set the tone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Six of his 10 rebounds in his double-double were offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Noah returned from sitting one game to left knee soreness, but Derrick Rose, Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson remained out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Al Jefferson and Cody Zeller sat for the Hornets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We see these standings every day. We see what's going on. And we're trying to get a high (playoff) seed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>- Noah on the Bulls' recent swoon.</td></tr>
