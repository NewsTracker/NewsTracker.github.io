<h3>Judge upholds warrant requiring Google to share contents of indicted Rand Paul aide's Gmail</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>IOWA CITY, Iowa - A judge is upholding a warrant allowing investigators to search the email account of an indicted political operative who has worked for Rand Paul, Ron Paul and Mitch McConnell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Magistrate Judge Helen Adams rejected a request Monday by Jesse Benton to quash a warrant ordering Google Inc. to turn over the contents of his Gmail account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The decision means the government will get access to thousands of emails that Benton sent and received dating back to 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Benton had argued the warrant was overly broad and violated his privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His attorney argued the government was conducting a "fishing expedition."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Benton and two other aides to Ron Paul's 2012 presidential campaign were indicted last week, accused of conspiring to buy the support of a state senator before that year's Iowa caucuses.</td></tr>
