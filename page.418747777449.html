<h3>New Mexico Democratic lawmaker to stay on LULAC board</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A New Mexico Democratic lawmaker says she will not resign from the board of the nation's oldest Latino civil rights group despite calls to step down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Rep. Patricia Roybal Caballero said this week she has the support from members of the League of United Latin American Citizens and looks forward to her role at the group's national treasurer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Caballero, who was elected last week, faced calls to resign since LULAC's bylaws prohibit elected officials from serving on the national board if they receive "wage compensation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Albuquerque Democrat is a member of the New Mexico House but receives no annual salary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, she receives per diems and is eligible for a pension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A LULAC lawyer ruled that Caballero was eligible to serve.</td></tr>
