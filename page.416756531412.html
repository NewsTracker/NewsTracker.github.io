<h3>Greek police: body of murdered 4-year-old can never be found</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greek police say the body of 4-year-old Bulgarian girl believed to have been killed by her father will likely never be found due to the way in which her killer disposed of her remains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Attica police chief Christos Papazafiri said Tuesday the child's remains were dumped in various trash bins in Athens "in a way that it was not possible to determine they were body parts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The young girl had been reported missing on April 24 by her mother, who originally told authorities she had left the child with an acquaintance and that the girl later disappeared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Police on Monday arrested the 27-year-old father on charges including murder and defiling a body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The girl's 25-year-old mother, who repeatedly changed her testimony, was also arrested on charges of endangering a child.</td></tr>
