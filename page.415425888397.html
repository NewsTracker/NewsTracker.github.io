<h3>Cabinet members urge Indonesia's President Joko Widodo to show mercy to Bali nine duo</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prominent figures in the Indonesian government, including senior cabinet members, have been urging President Joko Widodo to reconsider the executions of the Bali nine duo, Fairfax Media has learned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But Mr Joko has failed to be swayed, although an apparent delay of several weeks - and possibly months - in the executions will be used to redouble efforts to save the lives of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"There has been a direct approach to him [from a senior cabinet member] saying Chan and Sukumaran should not be executed but Jokowi rejected it," one source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fairfax Media has been asked not to name the interlocutor because it may jeopardise efforts to save the lives of the Australians and others on death row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Among those advocating a change of course are figures personally opposed to the death penalty, but also influential government members who publicly support capital punishment, insiders say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Jakarta governor Basuki Purnama - a close ally of Mr Joko - has already gone public with his objections to the killings, as has Prananda Surya Paloh, whose father is media mogul Surya Paloh, another key backer of the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But concerns are far more widespread among the elite, and the high ranks of government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While the message about the rehabilitation of Sukumaran and Chan has resonated, the bigger concern is the damage being done to Indonesia's international reputation as the execution saga unfolds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Cracks are showing," said another source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They know that after these executions, there are many more to come."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Joko announced in December he would reject all 64 applications for clemency for drug offenders facing the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Six of those have already been killed, including five foreigners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The next lot of 10 includes nine foreigners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Further down the track, among those to be executed are two Britons, another Dutch man and six Malaysians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The killing of the Malaysians is highly problematic for the Indonesian government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There are more than 200 Indonesians facing the death penalty in Malaysia, according to the Indonesian NGO Migrant Care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Joko has steadfastly maintained he wants to go ahead with the executions, which are popular in Indonesia, and publicly insisted he is unfazed by the international pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As well as Australia's strong diplomacy, the governments of Brazil, Holland, France, the Philippines and Nigeria have all lodged protests or withdrawn their ambassadors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>However, sources maintain Joko - a former mayor with no experience with foreign affairs - has been shocked by the strength of the condemnation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Jokowi just wants it to cool down," said another insider.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Cabinet secretary Andi Widjajanto, a key confidante of the Indonesian president, took the unusual step on Thursday of rebuking co-ordinating minister for security Tedjo Edhy Purdjiatno for his remarks that Indonesia would unleash a wave of 10,000 asylum seekers on to Australia if it continued to agitate against the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Andi said the policy would not be introduced and that Indonesia was keen to cooperate with other countries on combating drug crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The government has decided to postpone the killings until legal appeals are heard and won't proceed with the deaths by firing squad of any of the 10 felons slated for execution until they are all completed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But the office of attorney general sowed more confusion when spokesman Tony Spontana insisted on Thursday that the Supreme Court had written to say it would reject all three judicial reviews from death row inmates before they had even been considered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>An official at the Supreme Court said it wasn't true.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>All cases would be decided individually, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He said that one of the judicial reviews - from Indonesian Zainal Abidin - was not being processed on administrative grounds as the documents presented to the court were photocopies and there was no formal record the review had been filed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Zainal's lawyer Ade Yuliawan said the comments from Mr Spontana were "astonishing", adding that his remarks had come completely out of the blue and deeply distressed the family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran have a final appeal to be heard on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Indonesia's judicial commission is also investigating claims that the judges in their case asked for bribes in exchange for a lighter sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Indonesian human rights groups are preparing a Constitutional Court challenge related to death penalty cases that could also affect the duo.</td></tr>

<h3>Public?s access to government records faces roadblocks aplenty</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Authorities are undermining the laws that are supposed to guarantee citizens' right to information, turning the right to know into just plain "no."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Associated Press journalists filed hundreds of requests for government files last year, simply trying to use the rights granted under state open records laws and the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>What we discovered reaffirmed what we have seen all too frequently in recent years: The systems created to give citizens information about their government are badly broken and getting worse all the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>We're talking about this issue now because of Sunshine Week, created a decade ago to showcase the laws that give Americans the right to know what their government is up to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>These days, Sunshine Week is a time to put a spotlight on government efforts to strangle those rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The problem stretches from town halls through statehouses to the White House, where the Obama administration took office promising to act promptly when people asked for information and never to withhold files just because they might be embarrassing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Act promptly?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Shortly after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing over the South China Sea, we asked the Pentagon's top satellite imagery unit, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, what the U.S. was doing to help the search.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Agencies are supposed to give at least a preliminary response to such questions within 20 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A full year later, after the largest and most expensive search in aviation history, the agency is telling us only that it has too many FOIA requests to meet its deadlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A few months ago, the Treasury Department sent us 237 pages in its latest response to our requests regarding Iran trade sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nearly all 237 pages were completely blacked out, on the basis that they contained businesses' trade secrets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>When was our request made?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Nine years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It takes the State Department about 18 months to answer - or refuse to answer - anything other than a simple request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This week, we filed a lawsuit against the department for failing to turn over files covering Hillary Rodham Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, including one request we made five full years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>As the president said, the United States should not withhold or censor government files merely because they might be embarrassing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In government emails that AP obtained in reporting about who pays for Michelle Obama's expensive dresses, the National Archives and Records Administration blacked out one sentence repeatedly, citing a part of the law intended to shield personal information such as Social Security numbers or home addresses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The blacked-out sentence?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The government slipped and let it through on one page of the redacted documents: "We live in constant fear of upsetting the WH (White House)."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>To its credit, the U.S. government does not routinely overcharge for copies of public records, but price-gouging intended to discourage public records requests is a serious problem in many states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Officials in Ferguson, Missouri, billed the AP $135 an hour for nearly a day's work merely to retrieve emails from a handful of accounts about the fatal shooting of Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That was roughly 10 times the cost of an entry-level Ferguson clerk's salary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Other organizations, including BuzzFeed, were told they would have to pay unspecified thousands of dollars for emails and memos about Ferguson's traffic citation policies and changes to local elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Last year, the executive editor of the South Florida Gay News asked the Broward Sheriff's Office for copies of emails that contained a derogatory word for gays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The sheriff's office said it would cost $399,000 and take four years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"They succeeded in stonewalling me," said the editor, Jason Parsley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In Mississippi, the state Education Department demanded more than $70 an hour to review records when a reporter asked for its reorganization plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Despite head-pounding frustrations in using them, the Freedom of Information Act and state open records laws are powerful reporting tools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But it's important to remember that they don't exist just for journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The right to know what public officials are doing, how they're going about it, what money they are spending and why.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>that right belongs to all citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Government works better when the people who put it in office and pay for it with their taxes have an unobstructed view of what it is doing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>And that is why it is vital that we all fight every attempt _ from federal foot-dragging to outrageous photocopying bills _ to hide the public's information behind a big, padlocked door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>We need to let the sun shine in.</td></tr>
