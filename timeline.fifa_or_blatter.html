<li>LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - FIFA began the process of finding a replacement for outgoing president Sepp Blatter on Wednesday with the same system which has caused problems in the past.</li>
<li>The U.S. indicted nine current or former FIFA officials and five business executives only days before the last election.</li>
<li>On Wednesday, Switzerland's Office of the Attorney General seized further data from FIFA as part of its probe.</li>
<li>"The problem we have is not just the Sepp Blatter problem, it's the FIFA problem," he said, adding that any suggestion FIFA can reform itself is laughable.</li>
<li>FIFA announced on Wednesday that an extraordinary executive committee meeting will be held in July to discuss dates for the Congress where the new election will take place.</li>
