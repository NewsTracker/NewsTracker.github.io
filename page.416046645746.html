<h3>Sonny Gray takes no-hit bid into 8th, A's blank Rangers 8-0 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OAKLAND, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Bob Melvin did his best to keep Sonny Gray from becoming chatty between innings of his no-hit bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The pitcher kept wanting to discuss his walk-up music and get the manager's approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''I'm not very superstitious,'' Gray said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The right-hander didn't allow a hit until Ryan Rua singled leading off the eighth inning, and the Oakland Athletics snapped their record 10-game losing streak on opening day by beating the Texas Rangers 8-0 Monday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Trying to join Bob Feller (1940) as the only pitchers to throw a no-hitter on opening day, Gray dazzled through seven innings and allowed only two baserunners before Rua's sharp grounder to right field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Fans in the sellout crowd of 36,067 chanted ''Sonny!</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Sonny!'' and offered a roaring ovation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''I don't try to block it out at all, I try to use it,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ben Zobrist backed Gray's eight-inning gem with a two-run homer in the first and also had a double in his Oakland debut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Stephen Vogt added a three-run shot in the seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>New designated hitter Billy Butler hit an RBI double as the A's won their opener for the first time since beating Texas on April 5, 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Oakland's 10-game skid on opening day was the longest in major league history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gray (1-0) walked one and struck out three in his 98-pitch performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Evan Scribner worked a perfect ninth to finish the one-hitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Given the A's didn't want to jinx Gray by talking to him between innings, he was quick to greet Vogt with a chest bump when Vogt returned to the dugout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''Whether it's now or 10 years from now, or 15, I wouldn't say I expect it, but I would not be surprised if Sonny Gray does throw a no-hitter one day,'' said Vogt, the A's catcher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Gray arrived at the Coliseum at 1 p.m. and spent hours throwing a ball at the wall as he waited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''He was on it from pitch 1 today,'' said Melvin, relieved not to send Gray out for the ninth in Game 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Gray plunked No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>9 hitter Rougned Odor with a pitch in the third for the Rangers' first baserunner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Zobrist dropped Leonys Martin's fly to left for a two-base error in the sixth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Prince Fielder hit a sharp liner to start the seventh but it went straight to right fielder Craig Gentry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Moments later, second baseman Eric Sogard made a sliding stop on a hard-hit grounder by Adrian Beltre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Gray then struck out Shin-Soo Choo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''Our guys stayed stubborn with our approach,'' said new Texas manager Jeff Banister, who lost his debut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''We didn't try to get big with our swings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>We did have some barreled balls, but credit to Sonny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Gray needed only 83 pitches to get through seven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The 25-year-old beginning his second full big league season drew his second consecutive opening-day assignment, the first A's pitcher to do so since lefty Barry Zito in 2005 and 2006.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Zito is now back with his original organization pitching at Triple-A Nashville.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Yovani Gallardo (0-1) had a Texas debut that was largely forgettable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Gallardo was chased after four innings following five straight opening-day assignments with the Brewers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The right-hander allowed four runs and six hits, struck out five and walked one but threw two wild pitches among his 89 pitches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>On a night when retired infielders Mark Ellis and Eric Chavez threw out the ceremonial first pitches, Oakland fans were introduced to a largely new team featuring only nine players remaining from the 2014 opening-day roster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The Coliseum also introduced a new $10 million high-definition scoreboard that included a tribute to Hall of Fame broadcaster Lon Simmons a day after his death at age 91.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Fielder went 0 for 4 with a strikeout after missing most of 2014 following a cervical fusion of two disks in his neck last May, ending his then-major league-best streak of 547 consecutive games played since 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>He hadn't missed consecutive games since August 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Rangers: After missing a few days with the flu, including Texas' final exhibition game, Banister met his coaches for breakfast before grabbing a bit more rest and heading to the ballpark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He arrived at noon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>''Alive, brother, I'm alive,'' he said with a grin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Athletics: Left-handed reliever Sean Doolittle threw from 75 feet as he recovers from a shoulder injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Rangers: RHP Colby Lewis starts against his former team Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Athletics: RHP Jesse Hahn will make his A's debut in his first outing vs. Texas after being acquired from the Padres in December.</td></tr>
