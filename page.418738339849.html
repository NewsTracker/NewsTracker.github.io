<h3>Ex-Baltimore cop planning blackface fundraiser</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>-- A former Baltimore police officer said Wednesday that he plans to perform an Al Jolson routine in blackface to raise money for the six Baltimore officers who have been indicted in the death of Freddie Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bobby Berger, whose performances as Jolson created tension with the department in the 1980s, said Wednesday that 610 tickets have been sold in eight days at $45 each for the Nov. 1 fundraiser in Glen Burnie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Berger said in an interview he doesn't believe there is anything racial about his routine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's coincidence," Berger said about the fact that the entertainer he impersonates wore blackface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There's no racial overtones to this show. There's nothing racial to the show."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Michael Davey, an attorney for the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police, said officers do not support the fundraisers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gray was black and died in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Davey said no money would be accepted from the fundraiser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They've been put in a pretty bad position without their knowledge," Davey said of the police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tessa Hill-Aston, president of the Baltimore branch of the NAACP, says the idea is "very distasteful."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This is showing no sensitivity to the family of Freddie Gray," Hill-Aston said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gray's death from injuries received while in police custody prompted a wave of arson, looting and open confrontations with riot police in Baltimore in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Berger, who is 67, has performed the blackface signing act for decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He was fired from the police force in the 1980s for performing the act in his spare time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He was reinstated to his job following an appeal, but later retired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>His performance at a retirement dinner for a white Baltimore County officer in 1996 prompted a black officers group to protest outside the dinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said in an interview Wednesday that he only intended to help the officers who were indicted in the Gray case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I want to get these people some money," Berger said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I know they need it, and that's the long and short of it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The fundraiser was expected to be held at Michael's Eighth Avenue but a spokesman for the venue told CBS affiliate WJZ the plans were not confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"No contract was signed with Mr. Berger. Michael's does not condone blackface performances of any kind," the reception hall said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"As an event venue, it has not been the practice of Michael's Eighth Avenue to pre-approve entertainment that is planned as part of a contracted event. This policy will be carefully and thoughtfully reviewed. Michael's regrets any concerns that the discussions of this event may have caused in the community."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>WJZ spoke with Berger by phone and asked if he thinks his performance to raise money for the six officers perpetuates an underlying tone of racism surrounding the Freddie Gray case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He said no and says his act isn't racist.</td></tr>
