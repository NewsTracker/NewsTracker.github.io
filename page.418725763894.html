<h3>Ferguson hires black police chief</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Officials in Ferguson, Missouri, have hired an African-American police chief nearly a year after racial tensions rocked the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Andre Anderson, who most recently worked in Glendale, Arizona, will serve as chief for six months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Last August, a white police officer killed an unarmed black teenager there, sparking months of protests and unrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The mostly white police department's aggressive response to the protests came under heavy criticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Michael Brown's death was one of a number of contentious cases in the US in which white officers killed unarmed black men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A grand jury declined to charge the officer in Brown's death, but a US justice department investigation found widespread alleged racial bias in the police force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The city of Ferguson and our police department have endured a tremendous amount of distrust during the past nine months," Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We understand it will take time to once again gain the trust of everyone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The 50-year-old Mr Anderson said at a news conference on Wednesday that he would need the community's help in increasing trust between the police force and the people it serves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said he is interested in becoming Ferguson's permanent police chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I am asking the city of Ferguson if we can set a course in the history books that clearly proves that peace prevails," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There's a lot of work to be done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He mentioned President Barack Obama's "21st Century Policing" task force and said the department would be focusing on attracting and hiring quality applicants to be officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ferguson interim city manager Ed Beasley, who is also black, said Mr Anderson is "exceptionally known nationally on his ability to lead and his innovation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Knowles said that Ferguson, which is two-thirds black, has revamped its municipal court system, hired a new interim judge and that its police force is now equipped with body cameras.</td></tr>
