<tr><td>21</td><td>''We wanted to pressure them and not allow them to be comfortable, and we did that for the most part,'' Paige said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>Turns out ''Frank the Tank'' was just getting his team revved up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>With Kaminsky on the bench, the Badgers launched the 19-7 run that put them back in front, 65-60.</td></tr>
