<h3>One Direction determined to continue without Zayn Malik</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Niall Horan were devastated when Malik announced his decision to leave the band last month so he can live like a "normal 22-year-old", but they promised to continue performing without him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Now they have spoken out to underline their determination not to break up entirely, insisting One Direction will live on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tomlinson tells British newspaper The Sun, "All four of us are 100% committed to One Direction. We want to thank the fans for being so incredible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Payne adds, "We're gutted Zayn left. But after a few performances as a four-piece we feel confident and determined to carry on stronger than ever."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It comes after unconfirmed reports that Malik has been in a studio working with British producer Naughty Boy for his first material as a solo artist.</td></tr>
