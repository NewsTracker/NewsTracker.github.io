<h3>Call for archbishop to stand aside</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Philip Wilson has strenuously denied a NSW police allegation that he concealed a serious offence regarding child sexual abuse in the state's Hunter region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The abuse was allegedly committed during the 1970s by another priest, when both men worked in the Maitland Diocese, near Newcastle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 64-year-old archbishop released a statement on Tuesday saying he had taken immediate leave and had retained Ian Temby QC, one of the country's top barristers, to represent him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Broken Rights spokesman, Dr Bernard Barrett, said it would be "more credible and the public would then know they can have confidence" if Wilson officially stood aside from his position while the criminal charge is pending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Speaking on ABC Radio on Wednesday, he said taking some leave did not have the same status as saying "I'm standing aside, but I will come back after the judicial process is finished".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>SNAP Australia (Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests) welcomed the charging of Wilson, saying they hoped the charge was the first of many.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"For too long, survivors have seen those responsible for enforcing laws against covering up child sex crimes ignore evidence and fail to investigate in case after case," SNAP spokeswoman Nicky Davis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Wilson has been issued with a notice to appear in the Newcastle Local Court on April 30 on the charge of concealing a serious offence.</td></tr>
