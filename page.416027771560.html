<h3>Kenya launches air strikes on Al-Shabab</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Relatives stand to pray as they wait to go and view their loved ones who were killed during an attack on a university, during a ceremony at Chiromo funeral home in Nairobi, Kenya on April 6, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Al-Shabab gunmen killed scores of people at a university in northeastern Kenya on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kenya launched air strikes against fighters from the armed group Al-Shabab in Somalia following an attack on a college in eastern Kenya that killed 148 people, a military spokesman said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In the first major military response to last week's attack by Al-Shabab on Garissa university, warplanes attacked two camps of the Al-Shabab armed group on Sunday afternoon and early Monday morning, said Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>David Obonyo of the Kenyan military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Al-Shabab, which is based in Somalia, claimed responsibility for the college attack Thursday in the Kenyan town of Garissa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Four gunmen died in the assault, which ended after a 15-hour siege.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The group has killed more than 400 people in Kenya since April 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The air strikes occurred in the Gedo region of Somalia, Obonyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This is part of continuing operations, not just in response to Garissa," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Jets pounded the camps in Gondodowe and Ismail, both in the Gedo region bordering Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Cloud cover made it difficult to establish how much damage the bombings had caused or to estimate the death toll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta had vowed harsh measures against Al-Shabab following the attack on Garissa, which is near the border with Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kenya has troops in Somalia as part of an African Union force to attack al-Shabab and shore up the beleaguered Somali government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Kenya has carried out air strikes before, but it has struggled to stop the flow of al Shabaab militants and weapons across its porous border with Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Al-Shabab said it attacked students at Garissa College University as a reprisal for Kenya sending troops into Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Nairobi decided in 2011 to provide troops to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), with United Nations approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>This peacekeeping mission, which includes a military component that draws troops from Ethiopia, Djibouti, Burundi, Sierra Leone and Uganda, was put together to root out Al-Shabab from its strongholds in south and central Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The mission has counted a number of significant successes in recent years, such as the recapturing of important port cities along the Somali coast and the killing of several Al-Shabab leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In March, AMISOM seized Kuday, an island off the port city of Kismayo that Al-Shabab fighters used to smuggle contraband charcoal that it sells to Gulf states to sustain its operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The killing that same month of Adnan Garaar, who allegedly helped plan the Westgate attack, by a U.S. drone also delivered an important blow to the organization, the Pentagon reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Much of the capital of Mogadishu is back in the Somali government's hands, AMISOM reported, but car bombs and suicide attacks continue to rock the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Al-Shabab, Somalia's largest armed group, started out as one of many factions fighting against the U.N.-backed Transitional Federal Government based in Mogadishu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It morphed into what the United States labeled a "terrorist" organization after staging attacks on prominent foreign and national targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Why is Al-Shabab attacking Kenya?</td></tr>
