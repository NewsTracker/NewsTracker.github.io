<h3>Delhi gang-rape documentary airs early on BBC following objections</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The film, India's Daughter, was due to be aired on International Women's Day on Sunday but was brought forward to Wednesday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Delhi refused to allow it to be shown in India because it objected to the film-makers releasing it without their approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The BBC defended the broadcast, which seeks to explore the crime and the cultural context in which it was committed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A spokesman said it provided a "revealing insight into a horrific crime that sent shock waves around the world and led to protests across India demanding changes in attitudes towards women".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the film Sheila Dixit, the former Delhi chief minister, said women are undervalued in some parts of Indian society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Many people grow up thinking that the girl is less important than the boys. And, because she is less important, you can do what you like with her," she told the Storyville programme which aired on BBC Four.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mukesh Singh, who drove the bus on which the woman was raped and murdered, appears in the film, unapologetic for his crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He told the film-maker Leslee Udwin: "A decent girl won't roam around at nine o'clock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In a revealing interview, he added: "When being raped, she shouldn't fight back. She should just be silent and allow the rape. Then they'd have dropped her off after 'doing her', and only hit the boy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Details of his crimes were read out to him but he showed no regret, Udwin has written.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A prison psychiatrist who examined the rapists said India's jails hold men who have committed more than 200 rapes in their lifetime, while only being convicted for around a dozen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A lawyer for the rapists, who himself has said that he would burn his own daughter alive if she brought shame upon herself, claimed that many sitting MPs had committed similar crimes, but had not yet faced trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In order to change society, India's leaders should "start with their own necks", he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The programme gave an insight into the savagery towards the victim and the producers spoke to some prominent members of the protest movement that sprang up as a result of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>According to Justice Leila Seth, "the rape was extremely brutal and it's something very unusual to find that you not only rape the girl, but you put an iron rod and take out her entrails. I mean, this is something I can't understand; what kind of human beings are these who do something like that?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The victim was travelling on a bus with a male companion after going to see a film together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The gang challenged them as to why they were travelling together at night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The male companion was beaten, before she was repeatedly raped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After attacking her with the iron bar, the gang threw the pair from the bus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The producers spoke to her grieving parents, who talked about visiting their badly-injured daughter and seeing her die.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Four of the men await the outcome of a final appeal and face the death sentence, a fifth committed suicide in prison, while a juvenile convicted over the gang rape and murder is due for release in December this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Family and friends of the victim said they wanted to see justice done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But, according to Singh, the death penalty they have been given "will make things even more dangerous for girls".</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He said: "Now when [criminals] rape, they won't leave the girl like we did. They will kill her. Before, they would rape and say, 'leave her, she won't tell anyone'. Now, when they rape, especially the criminal types, they will just kill the girl. Death."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A BBC spokesman said: "This harrowing documentary, made with the full support and cooperation of the victim's parents, provides a revealing insight into a horrific crime that sent shock waves around the world and led to protests across India demanding changes in attitudes towards women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The film handles the issue responsibly and we are confident the programme fully complies with our editorial guidelines. The documentary has the backing of a number of other public service broadcasters, however the BBC is only responsible for transmission of the film in the UK."</td></tr>

<h3>Ferguson policies targeted blacks, created toxic environment: U.S. attorney general</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON/KANSAS CITY, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(Reuters) - A U.S. probe found systemic racial bias targeted blacks and created a "toxic environment" in Ferguson, Missouri, but cleared a white officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager there, Attorney General Eric Holder said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The report said the St. Louis suburb overwhelmingly arrested and issued traffic citations to blacks to boost city coffers through fines, used police as a collection agency and created a culture of distrust that exploded in August when Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This investigation found a community that was deeply polarized; a community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents," Holder told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Brown's killing touched off a national debate on race, led to months of street protests and amplified long-standing complaints in Ferguson and across the country of police harassment and mistreatment of minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It also prompted Justice Department probes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Of course, violence is never justified," Holder said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"But seen in this context, amid a highly toxic environment, defined by mistrust and resentment, stoked by years of bad feelings, and spurred by illegal and misguided practices, it is not difficult to imagine how a single tragic incident set off the city of Ferguson like a powder keg."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Holder, who is stepping down soon as attorney general, called for wholesale and immediate change in the way Ferguson operates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Justice Department has said it will likely seek a court-appointed monitor to implement changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The report said city employees made racially disparaging comments in emails, including one where an employee compared President Barack Obama to a chimpanzee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said three police department employees were responsible for the offensive emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>All were put on administrative leave pending a probe and one has since been fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>None of the employees was identified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Knowles addressed few other specifics in the report but told a news conference, where he read a statement and did not take questions, that the city had launched reforms such as diversity training for police officers and reduced some of the fines levied at municipal court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We must do better, not only as a city but as a state and a country," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The report reviewed the city's records and found that in a city where blacks make up about two-thirds of the population, they accounted for 85 percent of the total charges brought by Ferguson police, and more than 90 percent of arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Some police would compete to see who could issue the most citations to African-Americans, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Often the charges were trumped up, or fictitious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The city also looked to double its revenue in fines collected by the courts to a projected $3 million for its 2015 fiscal year, from over $1.3 million in 2010, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Ferguson police officers issued nearly 50 percent more citations in the last year than they did in 2010 - an increase that has not been driven, or even accompanied, by a rise in crime," Holder said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The report also led to fresh calls for Police Chief Tom Jackson and the city's mostly white leadership to step down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"He absolutely should not have that job anymore," said St. Louis-area lawyer Brendan Roediger, who has helped represent some of those protesting police actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>U.S. officials confirmed on Wednesday they could not find a civil rights reason to prosecute Wilson, who was not charged by a grand jury in Missouri for the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., parents of the slain teen, said the decision not to pursue federal charges against Wilson disappointed them but they hoped the report could cause changes in Ferguson and other parts of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Jeff Roorda, a spokesman for the St. Louis Police Officers Association, said rather than blaming racial bias, there should be a "mature, frank conversation in the country about why kids like Michael Brown ... end up in deadly confrontations with police."</td></tr>
