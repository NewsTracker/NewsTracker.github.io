<h3>Court-appointed monitor says Apple's antitrust cooperation 'sharply declined' in recent months</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The monitor, Michael Bromwich, says in a report made public Thursday that Apple's cooperation with the monitoring team "sharply declined" this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bromwich was appointed to review the Cupertino, California company's antitrust compliance policies and training after a judge concluded Apple violated antitrust laws when it entered the electronic book market in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In December, the technology giant got some sympathy from federal appeals judges deciding whether to reverse the judge's antitrust finding that Apple colluded with e-book publishers to raise prices and bust Amazon.com's control of the market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A lawyer for Apple did not immediately return a message seeking comment Thursday.</td></tr>
