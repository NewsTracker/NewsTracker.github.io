<h3>Netanyahu's Likud Party Wins Israeli Election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party has scored a resounding victory in Israel's election, final results show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With nearly all the votes counted, Likud appeared to have earned 30 of parliament's 120 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Exit polls had shown a tight race with Isaac Herzog's Zionist Union, but the centre-left party ended up with just 24 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Herzog told reporters: "A few minutes ago I spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and congratulated him on his achievement and wished him luck."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Netanyahu will now set about putting together a coalition government with right-wing and religious allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The win comes after he moved to the right in the final days of campaigning, including abandoning a commitment to negotiate a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a four-day pre-election blitz, he made a series of promises designed to shore up his Likud base and draw voters from other right-wing and nationalist parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As well as ruling out a Palestinian state, he also pledged to continue building settlements on occupied land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His victory is likely to mean continued tensions with the United States, which has had an increasingly fraught relationship with Mr Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The win was unexpected as the last opinion polls published four days before the vote showed the Zionist Union with a four-seat advantage over Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a statement, Likud said Mr Netanyahu intended to form a new government within weeks, with negotiations already under way with the pro-settler Jewish Home party led by Naftali Bennett, and with religious groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The critical party to get on side will be centrist Kulanu, led by former Likud member Moshe Kahlon, who won 10 seats, making him a kingmaker given his ability to side with either Mr Netanyahu or the centre-left opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Against all odds, we achieved a great victory for the Likud," Mr Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I am proud of the people of Israel, who in the moment of truth knew how to distinguish between what is important and what is peripheral, and to insist on what is important.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Reality is not waiting for us. The citizens of Israel expect us to quickly put together a leadership that will work for them regarding security, economy and society as we committed to do - and we will do so."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>If he manages to form a workable coalition, it would give Mr Netanyahu a fourth term in office after the six years he has already spent in power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It puts him on track to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister, a position currently held by the country's founding father and first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, who served between from 1948 to 1954 and from 1955 to 1963.</td></tr>

<h3>Wigan 0-2 Watford: Troy Deeney double sends Hornets top of the Championship</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>On Tuesday night, he scored twice against Mackay's Wigan for the second time this season to send Watford top of the Championship and a step nearer the Premier League.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was the sixth game in a row that Deeney has been on the scoresheet, muscling in to beat Ali Al-Habsi with a header nine minutes into the second half and then converting a penalty in stoppage time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>For Wigan and his old manager, however, the threat of relegation to League One looms large two years after the club dropped out of the top-flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They remain six points adrift of safety and fourth-from-bottom Rotherham, who now have a game in hand, after failing to win for the 16th successive home game - a miserable run stretching back seven months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'We've got eight games to go and we've got to win more than a couple of teams us, simple as that,' said Mackay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'We knew that Deeney would pose a real threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That's why I bought him (for Watford) in the first place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Despite the poor home form, Wigan had won their last four away games to give themselves a chance of survival and they had several chances to take the lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tommy Hoban had to throw his body in the way of Leon Clarke's goalbound effort, Sheyi Ojo blasted over when unmarked in a good position and Marc-Antoine Fortune had two opportunities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the promotion chasers went ahead in the 54th minute with a goal that was the product of classy build-up play and a brutal finish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Substitute Fernando Forestieri's clever pass gave Adlene Guedioura the opportunity to swing a cross to the far post where Deeney was charging in like an express train.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Watford skipper powered through Jason Pearce to meet the ball and head the ball emphatically past Al Habsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Guedioura and Matej Vydra both went close with shots after that, and Guedioura thought he had doubled Watford's lead when his deflected effort beat Al Habsi but Emmerson Boyce hooked the ball away to safety from under his own crossbar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>However Deeney made sure of victory in stoppage time, scoring from the penalty spot after Boyce had brought down Forestieri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic: 'Troy's in a good moment and that's good news for us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>His first goal, the way he attacked the ball and scored, was great.</td></tr>
