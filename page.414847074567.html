<h3>Bali nine executions: Indonesia's president did not have all the documents when he refused clemency</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Indonesia's President Joko Widodo refused clemency for the Bali nine duo facing execution without all the documentation of their cases due to the chaotic handover to his office from his predecessor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A source familiar with the events, who asked not to be named because of the extreme sensitivity of the case, told Fairfax Media Mr Joko had little more than a list of drug offenders on death row when he made the decisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Abbott spoke with Indonesian president Joko Widodo on Wednesday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Look, the current President simply takes over all pending applications of the death felons from the previous government, which the latter did not touch at all," said the source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"And there was just a few pieces of papers listing names of people on death row. No documents attached to the lists."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The source said that the President did not have a complete understanding of the rehabilitation of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, or documentation outlining the testimony from a former governor of Kerobokan prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The governor, Siswanto, testified that their transformation was genuine and had profoundly affected the penitentiary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The two organisers of the Bali nine heroin smuggling ring have run numerous vocational education courses inside Kerobokan, counselled drug addicted inmates and raised money for medical procedures for their fellow convicts and to improve facilities in the prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Joko was sworn in as President in October and refused the clemency of Sukumaran and Chan in December and January respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His predecessor Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had failed to consider their clemency for years and, after he left, the complete documentation for the clemency bids was not forwarded to Mr Joko's staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Fairfax Media understands the main list of 64 convicts on death row used by Mr Joko contained only the most scant information - names, nationality, ages when they were arrested and sentenced, the status of their legal appeals, and the province in which they are incarcerated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The revelations that Mr Joko had been making his clemency decisions without full information comes as lawyers for the pair prepare an appeal to Jakarta's administrative court arguing the process around the clemency rejection was flawed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They argue that the President rejected all the clemency petitions without reviewing them individually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Without wanting to disrupt the President's prerogative [to granting clemency], we submitted the lawsuit only due to the lack of clarity of reasons behind the President's decision to not grant pardon," said Todung Mulya Lubis, a lawyer for the pair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>After the decision on Tuesday to delay the transfer of the pair from Kerobokan to the execution island of Nusakambangan, the families and the duo's lawyers have expressed relief that they have been given more time to press their case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>However, Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comments that Indonesia should show mercy because of the $1 billion in aid provided to the country after the devastating 2004 tsunami in Aceh have not gone down well in Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Threats are not part of diplomatic language," said foreign affairs spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>" And from what I know, no one responds well to threats."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop said earlier that the postponement of the men's transfer from Bali was a positive sign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"While Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan are still alive, there is always hope," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We are continuing to press the case, just as Indonesia seeks clemency and seeks stays of execution for its nationals who find themselves facing the death penalty overseas."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Tim Lindsey, a professor of Asian law at Melbourne University, said the delay suggested the "headlong rush to execute has been interrupted and that is something".</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It does represent an opportunity for the government to take a breath about where it goes from here," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He added the situation was becoming more difficult for Indonesia as international criticism mounted over its "blatant double standards" when it came to executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The next time they have a maid facing decapitation in Saudi Arabia and they are seeking to get clemency for her, the government is going to say you haven't shown any similar mercy to those executed in your country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Imagine if someone was decapitated because of that - the government would be hugely criticised."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Professor Lindsey said presidential candidate General Prabowo Subianto got political mileage during last year's election campaign out of Indonesia's blood money payment to spare the life of a maid in Saudi Arabia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"You have two populist policies colliding - execute drug smugglers and save Indonesians overseas. That is unsustainable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A solution, he said, was to adopt the Constitutional Court recommendation that prisoners have their death sentences commuted to life imprisonment if they have been on death row for 10 years and have reformed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Bali nine duo have been on death row for almost 10 years over their role in the foiled attempt to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin to Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The head of the Bali correctional facility, the Bali police chief and the head of the Bali paramilitary unit met at Kerobokan prison on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The head of the Bali correctional facility, Nyoman Putra Surya Atmaja, said the police chief wanted to see the location and meet Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He said the brief meeting was "very relaxed" and the Australians didn't ask any questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"They had other things to do like meeting with family, so the meeting was very brief, maybe a minute or two. Andrew was with his family and Myuran was painting," Mr Atmaja said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>He said they were ready to hand over the prisoners but the timing was up to the Bali prosecutor's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Meanwhile, the lawyer for Brazilian man Rodrigo Gularte, who was convicted of smuggling 19 kilograms of cocaine in his surfboard in 2004, said the Attorney-General's office would seek a second opinion on whether his client had paranoid schizophrenia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Ricco Akbar hopes Gularte will not be executed because he has been diagnosed with symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"They will get another doctor to examine him and provide a second opinion before they decide what to do with Rodrigo."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>He said it was against the law to execute a mentally ill person or a pregnant woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Gularte is one of the nine other prisoners slated to be killed with Chan and Sukumaran in the second round of executions to be held in Indonesia this year.</td></tr>

<h3>Sony To Spin Off Its Audio and Video Business</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Japanese electronics and entertainment company said Wednesday that it would spin off its video and sound segment into a separate wholly owned subsidiary, following a similar move last year for its long-troubled television business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The goal is to get them more focused on profits while the Sony parent looks for growth in businesses such as movies, music, videogames and image sensors, said Mr. Hirai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After years of losses, Sony now aims to lift operating profit to Yen500 billion ($4.2 billion) in three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It expects to eke out an operating profit in the year ending in March, with the TV business turning to the black for the first time in a decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr. Hirai said Wednesday that he envisioned spinoffs of other units.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He also said the company would consider a sale of the TV unit or the company's struggling smartphone business, though he said nothing was currently in the works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr. Hirai said making units more autonomous would spur managers to focus on profitability and make it easier to pursue business alliances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Under the new structure, "each business unit will be more flexible and speedy in making business decisions and will be asked to be more responsible for what they do," said Atsushi Osanai, an associate professor at Waseda Business School in Tokyo who used to work at Sony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"A challenge for Mr. Hirai is to make sure these spun-off segments remain coherent as one Sony group."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr. Hirai introduced the slogan One Sony in 2012 as a way to draw together the company's disparate holdings, which range from electronics to entertainment to financial services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A year later Mr. Hirai rebuffed a proposal by the New York hedge fund Third Point LLC for a partial spinoff of Sony's entertainment businesses, which the firm said would unlock value that was obscured by the travails of Sony's electronics arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr. Hirai said Wednesday that Sony wasn't giving up on the One Sony approach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Under the new structure, Mr. Hirai, "there will be a good balance between centrifugal and centripetal forces."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Sony has sharpened its focus on profitability since Mr. Hirai named a new chief financial officer, Kenichiro Yoshida, last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>While Sony expects to post a net loss for the year ending March 31, it recently upgraded the outlook for its operating results, forecasting a profit of Yen20 billion instead of a loss of Yen40 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Since Mr. Yoshida took his job last April, Sony shares have risen 58%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The company has spun off its personal-computer unit and recently said it would pull the plug on its in-house music streaming business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In its place, Spotify AB will provide digital music for Sony devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr. Hirai, in a briefing on the company's midterm strategy, focused more on profitability goals than grand visions of Sony's future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The company, he said, wants to achieve a 10% return on equity, a broad measure of profitability, up from minus 7.4% for the year ending March 31.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Rather than pursuing sales volume, Mr. Hirai said, Sony will focus on growth in profitable areas such as the PlayStation game business and the image sensor unit, which makes cameras for Apple Inc. and other smartphone providers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It sees growing demand for the sensors in cars because of the spread of autonomous driving technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sony also sees its music division and its movie unit as growth drivers, even though the latter is still recovering from a cyberattack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mr. Hirai said the company would consider acquisitions of entertainment assets in places such as India.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In addition to a split-off of the video and sound units, which Sony said would take place by Oct. 1, the company said it was organizing its businesses into three categories according to their growth prospects, with content, games and image sensors at the top and smartphones and TVs at the bottom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The hierarchical arrangement is a "good step," said Yasuo Nakane, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, "though the question would be how much it will actually spend on image sensors and PlayStation, and how much it will not invest in smartphones and TVs to make sure they will be profitable."</td></tr>
