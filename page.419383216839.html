<h3>Conditions on a Greek island are so chaotic the government is housing Syrian migrants on a docked ship</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Thousands of Syrian migrants on the Greek island of Kos on Sunday began boarding a ship that is to house and process them, in a bid to ease chaotic conditions onshore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The ship, chartered by the Greek government, is to provide accommodation for around 2,500 Syrians in its cabins and an area for processing paperwork to claim asylum, before they are sent on to Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The vessel - which belongs to a company that ships tourists, cars and trucks to the Greek islands and across the Adriatic to Italy - is intended to take some of the pressure off Kos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Several thousand migrants are staying in hotels on the island if they can afford it, but more often sleep in tents, abandoned buildings or in the open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Approximately 2,300 people have died crossing the Mediterranean this year, in what Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU Migration Commissioner, described as the "worst refugee crisis since the Second World War."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Most of the quarter of a million migrants who made it safely to Europe this year arrived on the shores of Italy and Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>This weekend, Greek police struggled to keep order on Kos with new refugees arriving daily by rubber dinghies from Turkey just three kilometres away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The island has several thousand migrants camping out and staying in hotels, but tempers have flared as the numbers have swelled, worsening conditions and lengthening the wait for permission to leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Around 50 migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran threw punches and stones in clashes on Saturday outside the island's main police station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Syrians fleeing their country's civil war are given processing priority because they have refugee status under international law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But migrants from many other poor, war-torn nations are also living on Kos with scarce food, water or shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sicily's ports and temporary holding centres are also struggling to manage the crisis, with ships carrying hundreds of people- and often corpses - arriving daily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This weekend's survivors and victims are expected to arrive on Monday in Catania, where the mayor has pledged to bury the dead in a local cemetery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It's clear the world cannot wait any longer to solve the Libyan crisis," said Italy's interior minister, Angelino Alfano, warning that the latest tragedy would not be the last.</td></tr>
