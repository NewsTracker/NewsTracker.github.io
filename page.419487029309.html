<h3>Mexico says it is committed to protecting sea turtles, despite negative report from US</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY - Mexico is objecting to a U.S. decision to negatively certify it for not doing enough to reduce the deaths of endangered sea turtles in fishing nets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mexico said it "regrets" the U.S. decision, which could lead to a ban on some Mexican sea products if it doesn't bring protections up to U.S. standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Mexican Commission of Aquaculture and Fishing said Friday it "is committed" to sea turtle conservation that allow turtles to escape or avoid nets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Although Mexico adopted new regulations in April to reduce deaths of North Pacific loggerhead sea turtles in waters surrounding Baja California, the U.S. government said these measures were inadequate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mexico has put in place restrictions on the use of certain fishing nets, hooks and traps that are known to kill sea turtles.</td></tr>
