<h3>Need a miracle cure? Visit North Korea: Impoverished nation claims it has antidote for MERS, Ebola and AIDS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SEOUL - North Korea says it has succeeded where the greatest minds in science have failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The authoritarian, impoverished nation better known for pursuing a nuclear program despite global criticism announced Friday it has a drug that can prevent and cure MERS, Ebola, SARS and AIDS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The secretive state did not provide proof, and the claim is likely to provoke widespread skepticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The official Korean Central News Agency said scientists developed Kumdang-2 from ginseng grown from fertilizer mixed with rare-earth elements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>According to the pro-North Korea website Minjok Tongshin, the drug was originally produced in 1996.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Malicious virus infections like SARS, Ebola and MERS are diseases that are related to immune systems, so they can be easily treated by Kumdang-2 injection drug, which is a strong immune reviver," KCNA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>North Korea shut out foreign tourists for half a year with some of the world's strictest Ebola controls, even though no cases of the disease were reported anywhere near the country, before lifting the restrictions earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is believed to be struggling to combat diseases such as tuberculosis, and respiratory infections are among its most common causes of death, according to the World Health Organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>North Korea trumpeted the same drug during deadly bird flu outbreaks in 2006 and 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The North's claim comes as rival South Korea fights an outbreak of MERS that has killed two dozen people and sickened more than 160 since last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There is no vaccine for the disease.</td></tr>
