<h3>Van Praag withdraws from FIFA presidential bid</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - FIFA presidential candidate Michael van Praag has withdrawn from next week's election and thrown his weight behind Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein, he said on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Michael van Praag decided to withdraw his candidacy to become the next FIFA president and to join forces with presidential candidate Prince Ali Al Hussein," said a statement published by his campaign organisers on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Dutch FA president added that he had made the decision after "thorough deliberation and reflection with different involved parties and stakeholders" and would hold a news conference later on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Van Praag's announcement has left Jordan's Prince Ali and former Portugal international Luis Figo as the only challengers to incumbent Sepp Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The announcement meant the spotlight switched to Figo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The former Portugal forward's spokesman was not immediately available for comment, although on Wednesday had denied suggestions that the 42-year-old would also pull out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Luis is an independent candidate and he will keep being independent. He will not travel to Holland, contrary to what the rumours say," the spokesman told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Blatter, 79, is runaway favourite to secure a fifth mandate at the election in Zurich on May 29, where each of FIFA's 209 member associations holds one vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Of Blatter's three challengers, Van Praag was the most outspoken critic of the Swiss administrator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In March, he told UEFA's Congress that Blatter's opponents had a responsibility to "clean up the mess" and that the "beautiful heritage of international football has been tarnished" by allegations of corruption.</td></tr>
