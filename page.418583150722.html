<h3>Cr-ouch! Google self-driving car has first injury accident</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>One of Google's self-driving car prototypes has been involved in an injury accident for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A Lexus SUV with sensors and cameras installed by the tech giant was rear-ended in Google's home city of Mountain View, California, where more than 20 prototypes have been self-manoeuvring through traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The three people on board, who complained of minor whiplash injuries, were checked at a hospital and cleared to go back to work following the July 1 collision, Google said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The driver of the other car also complained of neck and back pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In California, a person must be behind the wheel of a self-driving car being tested on public roads to take control in an emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google typically sends another employee in the front passenger seat to record details of the ride on a laptop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In this case, there was also a back seat passenger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>According to an accident report Google filed with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Google's SUV was travelling at about 15mph in self-driving mode behind two other cars as the group approached a junction with a green light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The first car slowed to a stop so as not to block the junction as traffic on the far side was not moving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Google car and the other car in front of it also stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Within about a second, a fourth vehicle hit the rear of the Google car at about 17mph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On-board sensors showed the other car did not brake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The driver of that car reported "minor neck and back pain".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The SUV's rear bumper was slightly damaged, while the vehicle that struck it lost its front bumper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mountain View police responded, but did not file an accident report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Google has been a pioneer of self-driving technology, which it believes will be safer and more efficient than human-driven cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>This is the 14th accident in six years and about 1.9 million miles of testing, according to the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Google has said that its car has not caused any of the collisions, though in 2011 an employee who took a car to run an errand rear-ended another vehicle while the Google car was out of self-driving mode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In a blog posted yesterday, the head of Google's self-driving car programme, Chris Urmson, said his SUVs "are being hit surprisingly often by other drivers who are distracted and not paying attention to the road".</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In an interview, Mr Urmson said his team was exploring whether its cars could do something to alert distracted drivers before a collision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Honking the horn would be one possibility, but Mr Urmson said he worried that could annoy residents of Mountain View.</td></tr>
