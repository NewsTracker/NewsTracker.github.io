<h3>Liberia confirms new Ebola case as outbreak spreads</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A man walks by a health information mural in Monrovia, Liberia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Monrovia: A Liberian woman has died of Ebola in a hospital shortly after being admitted, becoming the sixth confirmed case and second death since the virus resurfaced last month, a senior medical official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The victim, Kebbeh Kollie, lived near the capital Monrovia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She was the sister of Cassius Kollie, one of five Ebola cases discovered in neighbouring Margibi County, where the disease re-emerged after a seven-week lull.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Her detection raised fears that the infection may be spreading in the Montserrado County area of Liberia, which includes the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A quarantined home is seen in Nedowein, Liberia on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>More than 11,200 people have died from Ebola since an epidemic broke out in December 2013 in neighbouring Guinea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Liberia was declared Ebola-free on May 9 but reported a new case nearly two months later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The outbreak is also still active in Sierra Leone and Guinea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There is one new case," Liberia's chief medical officer, Dr. Francis Kateh, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This time, the response area is Montserrado county. The person died in Monrovia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A health worker sprays disinfectant on an ambulance in Nedowein, Liberia on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A health report sent to officials in the anti-Ebola response unit said the woman died a few hours after admission, indicating that surveillance of known contacts from the earlier cases had not been rigorous enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Sixteenpeople were under quarantine in the Kollie family's unfinished house and the woman's brother was being treated at a specialised unit in the capital..</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Monday, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in the US, said a single dose of a new Ebola vaccine that can be inhaled has been found to neutralise the deadly virus in monkeys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was the first attempt to use an aerosol to vaccinate monkeys against a hemorrhagic viral fever, researchers from University of Texas and National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But the success of the vaccine in monkeys is no guarantee that it will work in people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>This year, an Ebola drug that had been effective in monkeys failed to help humans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The first detected case in the current virus resurgence in Liberia, 17-year-old Abraham Memaigar, died before his infection was confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Neighbours voiced sympathy for the Kollie family in their quarantine but also concern over the spread of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Their daughter has died and now someone there could be sick," said Junior Flomo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I am afraid for myself and my family. Family came to visit them and now someone has died of Ebola. That could happen to us, too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Health officials say the virus probably remained latent in Liberia during the lull and could have been reactivated by a survivor, via sexual transmission.</td></tr>
