<h3>Polish Prosecutors: US Is Obstructing CIA Prison Probe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The U.S. is hampering Poland's investigation into the secret CIA prison by snubbing repeated requests for vital documents, including the Senate report detailing CIA prison locations and practices, a Polish prosecutor said Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Published in December, the summary of the report was redacted and did not mention Poland by name, but other facts in it pointed to the country and a secret CIA prison there from 2002-2003, where terror suspects were submitted to harsh treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Piotr Kosmaty, spokesman for the Appeals Prosecutor's Office in Krakow, said Saturday that Poland immediately asked the U.S. justice authorities for a full version of the document, but has had no response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Previous requests for documents and questioning of the alleged victims - now held in Guantanamo - were ignored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At one point the U.S. authorities said that providing materials would be against the U.S. national interests, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This is undoubtedly hampering the investigation," Kosmaty told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>One former Polish official has been charged in the investigation, underway since 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The European Court of Human Rights last year ordered Poland to pay compensation to two terror suspects who say they were tortured at a CIA secret prison in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Poland said it would abide by the ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The U.S. report prompted Polish leaders of the time, Aleksander Kwasniewski and Leszek Miller, to admit - after years of denials - that they authorized a prison, but not torture.</td></tr>
