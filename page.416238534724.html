<tr><td>2</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - Activists from Mexico, the United States and Canada are asking the U.N. World Heritage Committee to include the Monarch butterfly wintering reserve on a list of sites considered in danger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>UNESCO designated the 139,000-acre (56,259 hectare) reserve in the mountains west of Mexico City a World Heritage site in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Monarchs from the U.S. and Canada migrate 3,400-miles (5,470-kilometers) each year to winter in the forest reserve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the number of butterflies wintering in Mexico has dropped steeply in recent years, leading to worries the migration might end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Writer and activist Homero Aridjis said Monday that adding the Monarch site to the list is needed to spur governments into greater efforts to protect the butterflies' habitat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Much of the milkweed the butterflies depend on has been killed by herbicides.</td></tr>
