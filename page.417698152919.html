<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>UNITED NATIONS (AP) " The U.N. Security Council is calling for stepped-up action in Africa against the extremist group Boko Haram which has increased its often deadly attacks and the Lord's Resistance Army which has significantly escalated abductions to fill its fighting ranks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The council warned that the security situation in parts of the Central African region is "grave" because of "terrorist activities" by Boko Haram which are spilling into neighboring Chad and Cameroon, the LRA threat, the ongoing crisis in Central African Republic, maritime insecurity in the Gulf of Guinea, the illegal trade in wildlife, and organized crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A presidential statement approved by all 15 council members Thursday expressed concern at the link between illicit trafficking in wildlife and natural resources and financing of armed groups including the LRA.</td></tr>
