<h3>Volcano erupts on Galapagos island home to unique pink iguanas</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>QUITO A volcano perched atop one of Ecuador's Galapagos islands erupted in the early hours of Monday, the National Park said, potentially threatening a unique species of pink iguanas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The roughly 1.7 kilometer (1.1 mile) high Wolf volcano is located on Isabela Island, home to a rich variety of flora and fauna typical of the archipelago that helped inspire Charles Darwin's theory of evolution following his 1835 visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The Wolf volcano is not located near a populated area. There is not risk for the human population. This is the only population of pink iguanas in the world," The Galapagos National Park said on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ecuador's government was not immediately available for comment on potential harm to the island's ecosystem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The park posted pictures showing lava pouring down the sides of the Wolf volcano, the Galapagos' highest point, while dark plume billowed overhead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Wolf had been inactive 33 years, according to the park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In April, unusual activity was also reported at the Sierra volcano on the same Isabela island, the archipelago's biggest, where yellow iguanas and giant turtles also live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The eruption in Ecuador comes on the heels of eruptions in Chile, another South American country located on the so-called Pacific Rim of Fire.</td></tr>
