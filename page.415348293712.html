<h3>Newlywed who pushed husband off cliff appeals murder conviction</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In court documents filed on Monday with a federal appeals court, Jordan Graham said through her attorney that prosecutors wrongly argued she should go to prison for life because she plotted the death of her newlywed husband before shoving him off a cliff at Glacier National Park in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Graham later pleaded guilty to second-degree murder tied to Cody Johnson's death and was sentenced to 30 years in prison by a federal judge who refused to let her withdraw a guilty plea secured under a deal with prosecutors that saw them dismiss a first-degree murder charge, which alleges premeditation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Graham appealed the conviction in October, saying that prosecutors distorted facts and acted vindictively toward her during the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prosecutors responded in January by saying the former nanny had no grounds for appeal since she lied to officials and used trickery in trying to conceal her crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Then in the latest round of filings to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Graham's lawyer complained that prosecutors had improperly used the claim that she used a blindfold to persuade a federal grand jury to hand down a first-degree murder indictment and then largely abandoned the issue until raising it again during sentencing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The cloth itself is mentioned one time in passing, but otherwise 'poof' it is gone," defence attorney Michael Donahoe wrote about prosecutors' written statements of fact in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Donahoe also said the government's argument that his client deserved life for lying to police, friends and relatives about her husband's disappearance was not sufficient cause for her severe punishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He acknowledged that Graham engaged in a "somewhat shameful manner" after the incident but said that was because she feared authorities might not buy her account that she accidentally shoved her husband off a cliff during a marital dispute while climbing a steep trail at Glacier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Graham told an FBI agent of that fear in a "delicious irony" that "turned out to prefigure almost exactly what would follow in this prosecution," Donahoe told the court in legal documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Prosecutors did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment.</td></tr>

<h3>Video shows Suge Knight ran down two men in his truck</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Following Knight's brief appearance in a Los Angeles County court on Monday, defense lawyer Matthew Fletcher told reporters: '100percent it proves Suge Knight was attacked,' according to the Los Angeles Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The video, published by TMZ today, was recorded by surveillance cameras at Tam's Burgers in Compton, Los Angeles on January 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It shows one of Knight's alleged victims, Cle 'Bone' Sloan, confront him as soon as he pulls up to the parking lot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Knight throws his truck into reverse, knocking Sloan down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He then shifts the vehicle back into drive, running Sloan over and hitting Terry Carter, who was standing nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Carter, a 55-year-old grandfather, had his head crushed beneath Knight's truck and was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Knight says the video exonerates him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Defense lawyer Fletcher says it shows that he was in danger the moment he pulled up to the restaurant where Dr. Dre was filming scenes for his NWA biopic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He says the video shows a gun in Sloan's waistband.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>According to TMZ, prosecutors argue that the video shows that opposite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They say that after Knight threw his truck into reverse, he should have been able to safely flee the scene if his life was indeed in danger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Knight, who is charged with murder and attempted murder for the hit-and-run, is due to appear in court today for an evidence hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This is the moment that Terry Carter was hit and killed by Suge Knight's truck in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The confrontation happened after Suge tried to approach Dr. Dre while he was filming 'Straight Out of Compton.' He says he wanted to make peace with the fellow hip hop mogul after a falling out, according to TMZ.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Instead, he was confronted by Sloan, who was working security for Dr Dre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Knight's lawyers say he was threatened with a gun and that he feared for his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He says he was surrounded by a group of armed men and that his only way out was to drive through Sloan and Carter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He argues that he believed he would be shot if he continued to reverse and that the only safe way out was for him to drive forward, through Sloan and Carter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The video also shows a man approach Sloan, who was writhing on the ground, and pull something from his waistband.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>TMZ reports that Knight is claiming that is proof Sloan had a gun at the time of the confrontation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Carter's family told TMZ they want the video released to the public to show he Knight mowed him down and killed him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Carter's funeral was attended by 2,000 people and he was saluted as a businessman and a community leader who mentored neighborhood children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Knight is being held without bail and has been admitted to the hospital three times since being jailed.</td></tr>
