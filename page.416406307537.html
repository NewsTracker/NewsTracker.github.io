<tr><td>15</td><td>Most, however, have been dismissed as hoax or fantasy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some experts believe the beast represents a line of long-surviving plesiosaurs, a type of carnivorous aquatic reptile from millions of years ago, while one of the most accepted explanations is that the monster is in fact a giant sturgeon, which can grow up to 12ft (3.7 metres) long.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>But it has remained a contested phenomenon for 81 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Perhaps the most famous picture of Nessie was taken by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson, a London gynaecologist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It was published in the Daily Mail on 21 April 1934 and showed what looked like a long neck and head rising from the water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>However, it turned out to be a toy submarine bought from Woolworths with a head and neck made of wood in an elaborate hoax by big-game hunter Marmaduke Wetherell in an act of revenge on the newspaper that had ridiculed him over his hapless search for the beast.</td></tr>

<tr><td>28</td><td>St Columba, an Irish monk, had sent a disciple into the loch to prove there was nothing there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But the monster rose and chased the man snapping at his heels.</td></tr>

<tr><td>39</td><td>In May 2007, Gordon Holmes, a 55-year-old lab technician, captured video of what he said was 'this jet black thing, about 45ft long, moving fairly fast in the water'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The film, though, has been cast into doubt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Mr Holmes has been criticised for claiming the existence of fairies and another expert later claimed the film actually shows otters swimming in the loch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>William Jobes took what appears to be a close-up of the Loch Ness Monster in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>In February 2012, a sonar image of a large mystery object deep below the surface of Loch Ness netted boat skipper Marcus Atkinson the Best Nessie Sighting of The Year Award - the first time in several years it has been presented by bookmaker William Hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The sonar picture, that shows a large unidentified living object deep underwater, was recorded by Loch Ness boat skipper Marcus Atkinson.</td></tr>

<tr><td>49</td><td>It was taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson and published in the Daily Mail on 21 April that year, but was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed the pictures were staged.</td></tr>

<tr><td>51</td><td>Adrian Shine has been carrying out fieldwork in the Highlands since 1973 and has logged more than 1,000 Nessie sightings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>He said: 'The Google project was so cloaked in secrecy, when people asked about the ripples in the loch during the special diving expeditions, for once I had no opinion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Research carried out 20 years ago estimated the Nessie phenomenon having an economic impact of 40 million ($59 million) to the Scottish economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>With inflation, this figure would have risen to 60 million ($89 million) by now.</td></tr>
