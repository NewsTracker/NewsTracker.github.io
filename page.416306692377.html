<h3>Greek, creditor representatives to meet again this weekend</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greek officials say negotiators are to meet representatives of the country's creditors again on Saturday to "find common ground" in tortuous talks over the future of Greece's bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dependent on funds from two multi-billion euro bailouts since 2010, Greece is fast running out of cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Negotiations with representatives of its creditors in other eurozone countries, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank have not gone well, with the new left-wing government in Athens insisting their demands are too onerous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>For their part, the creditors insist the country must produce credible reforms before they unlock the final 7.2 billion euro installment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Without it, Greece could default on debts it must repay the IMF next month, and run out of cash to pay salaries and pensions.</td></tr>
