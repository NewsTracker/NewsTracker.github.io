<h3>World Health Organisation slammed on Ebola response</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Is Ebola back in Liberia?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Liberia, one of the countries hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic, reports its first new case since being declared free of the lethal virus seven weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>London: Experts have recommended urgent, root-and-branch changes to the World Health Organisation after an inadequate response to West Africa's vast and deadly Ebola outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The UN agency "does not currently possess the capacity or organisational culture to deliver a full emergency public health response", a panel of independent experts said in a report on the WHO's handling of the Ebola crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Children in front of their home on the outskirts of Monrovia on Liberia earlier this month, quarantined since a 17-year-old boy who lived nearby died from the Ebola virus in a disturbing resurgence of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The panel faulted the agency for being sluggish, financially unprepared and overly reliant on "good diplomacy".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It pointed to a lack of "independent and courageous decision making by the director general," Dr Margaret Chan, in the early days of the Ebola epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The report urged the agency's regional and country representatives to be independent and ready to speak out against recalcitrant governments that do not take sufficient action on their own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And it faulted donor countries for stripping the agency's funding, urging them to contribute immediately to a "contingency fund" designed to respond to disease outbreaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The panel, led by Dame Barbara Stocking, the former head of the aid organisation Oxfam, did not call for personnel changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But it said a rapid overhaul of the organisation was needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The house where the 17-year-old lived before he died of Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Authorities say that contact tracing has intensified in the Liberian district where the teenager died, as a third person has been found to have the deadly virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It said that WHO leaders should have declared the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency much sooner than they did, and that the delay stemmed in part from not wanting to challenge governments worried about negative economic and trade consequences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The WHO declared Ebola a global health emergency only in August 2014, after it had already killed 1,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The panel recommended that a $US100 million ($134 million) contingency fund, suggested by WHO for future emergencies, be fully financed by member states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It also called for the creation of a separate emergency preparedness and response unit within the WHO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"This is a defining moment for the health of the global community," the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"(The) WHO must re-establish its pre-eminence as the guardian of global public health. This will require significant changes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Ebola health workers spray disinfectant on an ambulance that was used to transport two people suspected of having the Ebola virus on the outskirts of Monrovia earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Geneva-based WHO has been widely criticised for its response to the Ebola epidemic - which killed more than 11,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - and for its early assurances that the disease was under control despite repeated warnings to the contrary by the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Director-General Dr Chan admitted in May it had been "overwhelmed" by the Ebola epidemic and "ought to have reacted far earlier".</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Responding to Tuesday's report, the WHO said it was already moving forward on some of the panel's recommendations, including the development of the emergency unit and the contingency fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Health workers take a blood specimen from a child to test for the Ebola virus in the district where the 17-year-old had lived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The expert panel also said the 2005 International Health Regulations, agreed by 196 WHO member countries to try to track and control the spread of disease, must be strengthened and properly implemented to allow proper handling of epidemics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The world simply cannot afford another period of inaction until the next health crisis," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The 2005 International Health Regulations were reviewed and changes recommended in 2011 after the 2009/2010 H1N1 flu pandemic, the panel said, but many countries have not acted on that review - a failure that made the Ebola response even worse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Had the (2011) recommendations for revision ... been implemented, the global community would have been in a far better position to face the Ebola crisis," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity who has previously called for a separate emergency response unit to be established within WHO, urged governments to support the panel's recommendations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"It's essential that this new body is accountable and can show leadership in the face of emerging health threats, with the authority and independence to act quickly when needed," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"The support of the global community is also crucial if we are to avert another catastrophe on the scale of Ebola."</td></tr>
