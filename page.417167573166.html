<h3>Hillary Clinton gets LinkedIn</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Like millions of Americans in the market for a new job - or simply looking to tout their experience in the business world - Hillary Clinton has joined LinkedIn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The former secretary of state's page lists her as a 2016 presidential candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Her summary - some of which she borrowed from her Twitter bio - reads, "Wife, mother, grandmother, women and kids advocate, FLOTUS, FLOAR, Senator, Secretary of State, dog person, hair icon, pantsuit aficionado, 2016 presidential candidate" (FLOTUS stands for first lady of the United States and FLOAR stands for first lady of Arkansas).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As of 11 a.m. Thursday, Clinton had over 2,500 followers on LinkedIn - a paltry sum compared to the 3.55 million people who follow her on Twitter and the 833,000 who like her Facebook page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She picked up more than 350,000 of those followers during her first day on Twitter in June 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The site chronicles her work history from her days as a staff lawyer at the Children's Defense Fund in New Bedford, Massachusetts to her current job as a presidential candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Her position as the 2008 Democratic presidential nominee is not listed among the jobs she has held; that time period is covered by the line that reads, "United States Senator, D-NY."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The page also features a few videos from her nascent presidential campaign and an article she posted on LinkedIn called "Four Ways to Jump-Start Small Business."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The four tactics she lists are cutting red tape, expanding access to capital, providing tax relief and tax simplification, and expanding access to new markets.</td></tr>
