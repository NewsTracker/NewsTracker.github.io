<h3>New machines aim to revive troubled New Mexico green chile</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Efforts are underway to save the green chile that's important to traditional New Mexican fare as labor shortages, a previous severe drought and competition from China, India and Mexico endanger its growth in the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Las Cruces Sun-News reports (http://goo.gl/jyfsGJ ) that investors and inventors are running tests this week of machines that would harvest and de-stem the crop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The delicate chiles are now picked by hand, and problems with bruising and removing their stems have made the change to machines difficult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>New Mexico land dedicated to growing chile has long been declining, and experts say mechanization might stop or even reverse the trend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Federal numbers show overall chile acreage harvested across New Mexico fell last year to a 43-year low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The trial runs involve harvesting machines from U.S. and Israeli company's and an American inventor's device to pull the stems.</td></tr>
