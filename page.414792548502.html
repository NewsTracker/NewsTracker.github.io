<h3>Melbourne man to fight against Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Khamis Gewargis Khamis is based on the frontline in the town of Baqofa, about 30 kilometres north of IS-controlled Mosul, the ABC reported on Monday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr Khamis, who is married with two children, joined an independent Assyrian militia known as Dwekh Nawsha, meaning "self sacrificers", intending to fight until his ancestral land is free from IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said he was concerned that he may be breaking Australian laws prohibiting Australians from fighting in foreign wars, but said he was "prepared to stand in front of the law".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"[IS fighters] don't discriminate when it comes to killing, torture and so on," Mr Khamis told the ABC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"So we would like the entire international community to be stronger, to get together and urgently help [the Assyrians] from humanitarian side, and also to do what they can to eradicate [IS], to eliminate them, to drive them out of these towns, villages and these territories so the people can return back to their homes and their lands. This is our message. Help us. Please."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Despite Assyrian community leaders in Australia insisting that people such as Mr Khamis are fighting, rather than joining, IS or planning terror attacks, a spokesman for Attorney-General George Brandis told the ABC that anybody fighting for Dwekh Nawsha may be breaking Australian law.</td></tr>
