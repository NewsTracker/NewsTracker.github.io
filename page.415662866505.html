<h3>US considers 'other steps' to bypass Benjamin Netanyahu</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jerusalem:The United States is weighing a new approach to Middle East peace that may be less supportive of Israel, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised doubts that he would ever accept a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>US Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro said on Israeli radio on Sunday that if it's impossible to reach a peace deal with the Palestinians as long as Mr Netanyahu is prime minister, the question arises: "what other steps can be taken to continue in the right direction of attaining two states for two peoples".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The day before Israel's March 17 election, Mr Netanyahu said that there would be no Palestinian state if he returned to office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After winning the vote he softened his stance, saying he wanted a two-state solution but "circumstances have to change".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The official process of forming a new government began on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, and US President Barack Obama in the White House in March last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>President Barack Obama's administration has signalled it may reconsider its policy of siding with Israel in votes at the United Nations Security Council, where the US frequently blocks resolutions opposed by Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The US has helped to block Security Council resolutions condemning Israeli activities such as settlement building in the West Bank, and helped to ensure the UN body withholds recognition of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It has also opposed efforts to file complaints over alleged Israeli war crimes to the International Criminal Court, which the Palestinians will join on April 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Benjamin Netanyahu's stance on the two-state solution has alienated US president Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Shapiro said the US has "not yet reached any decisions" about its new course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Obama and Mr Netanyahu have clashed over several issues in the past six years, including West Bank settlements and talks with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Netanyahu's recent comments, and the prospect of his heading a new government even more resistant to peace with the Palestinians, could bring relations between the allies to an even lower point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership", Mr Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"That's why we've got to evaluate what other options are available."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Obama's remarks drew criticism both in Israel and from his political opponents in the US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"If the Americans find it difficult to understand or accept our clarifications, that is really worrying and must be addressed," Israeli Minister of Intelligence and Strategic Affairs Yuval Steinitz told Israel Radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The prime minister didn't say we are going back on our agreeing to two states for two peoples. He said that the reality has changed, he said we don't have a partner now whom we can trust."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Republican Senator John McCain said Israel's election was "free and fair" and urged Obama to work with Mr Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Netanyahu's vow to oppose a Palestinian state, and his expression of concern about Israeli Arab voters' influence, helped his Likud party recover from an opinion-poll deficit to win the most parliamentary seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The prime minister still needs support from other factions to form a coalition, a process that officially began Sunday, as Israeli President Reuven Rivlin started consultations with party leaders, and may take weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Netanyahu has said he sees Economy Minister Naftali Bennett's Jewish Home party, which opposes any Palestinian state and supports more Jewish settlement in the West Bank, as Likud's most natural ally.</td></tr>
