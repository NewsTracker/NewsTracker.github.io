<h3>Bomb kills Egypt's top prosecutor as he drives to work</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egyptian policemen stand guard after a bomb attack that targeted Egypt's prosecutor general in the Heliopolis district of Cairo, Egypt, Monday, June 29, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An official says Monday's attack targeted Hisham Barakat's convoy, wounding two security guards and a civilian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The official says it's not yet clear if Barakat was hurt or not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - A car bomb killed Egypt's chief prosecutor Monday in the country's first assassination of a senior official in 25 years, marking what could be an escalation in a campaign by Islamic militants toward targeting leaders of a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hisham Barakat led the prosecution of members of the Brotherhood and other Islamists, including former President Mohammed Morsi, who was overthrown by the military in July 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The courts have been handing out mass death sentences against them in trials harshly criticized as lacking due process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Monday's assassination of the 65-year-old Barakat came on the eve of the second anniversary of the mass demonstrations against Morsi that led to his ouster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A car laden with explosives was detonated by remote control around 10 a.m. as Barakat's motorcade left his home in the eastern district of Heliopolis, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He suffered multiple shrapnel wounds and was pronounced dead at 12:30 p.m. following surgery, medical officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Five guards, two drivers and one civilian also were injured in the blast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An Egyptian militant group calling itself "Popular Resistance in Giza" claimed responsibility for the attack in an online statement, with photographs from the site of the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The claim could not be independently verified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In a statement, the Muslim Brotherhood denied responsibility, but blamed authorities for the violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Authorities and pro-government TV networks blamed the Brotherhood, which they consider a terrorist group, broadly accusing it of orchestrating violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A senior security official said an initial investigation showed that Islamic militants along with the Brotherhood were responsible, while the State Information Service said the killing "clearly shows the terrorist group's violent discourse" and underscores its "rejection of the state of law."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It equated the Brotherhood with extremist groups fighting in Iraq and Syria or killing tourists in Tunisia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Brotherhood has maintained that peaceful means are the only way to resist what it called a coup against Morsi, but recent shifts within the group's youth cadres have signaled frustration with that approach and new support for using force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Islamic militants, who for years had turned Egypt's Sinai Peninsula into a stronghold, widened their insurgency after Morsi's overthrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Militants have focused on police and the military but in recent months have targeted the judiciary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>On Sunday, the Islamic State released video showing the May assassination of three judges in the northern Sinai city of el-Arish, accusing them of ruling against "God's laws."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>While most of Egypt's major suicide bombings were carried by an Islamic State affiliate - previously known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis - lesser-known groups under the "Popular Resistance" moniker have claimed responsibility for smaller attacks, including those against police and sabotaging infrastructure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The killing recalled one of Egypt's darkest chapters, when Islamic militants and the state security apparatus engaged in retaliatory killings for nearly a decade starting in 1990.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>That year, the militants gunned down parliament speaker Rifaat el-Mahgoub in Cairo, the last assassination of a senior official.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>There were attempts against other ministers until the insurgency was crushed in the late 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>At the site of Monday's bombing, rubble and twisted metal was strewn across a city block.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Several charred cars were in the middle of the street, and a dozen others were wrecked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Nearby buildings also were damaged, including ground-floor shops, apartment balconies and dozens of windows were shattered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Some residents sobbed as they went through the debris.</td></tr>
