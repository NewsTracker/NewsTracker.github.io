<h3>RX for Baltimore economy: More residents with money to spend</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - The fragility of Baltimore's economy was exposed by Freddie Gray's death from a spinal injury suffered while in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The tragedy unleashed protests, looting and a widespread recognition that Baltimore's poor have long lacked job opportunities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But it also revealed the easily overlooked absence of a stable upper-middle class, the same group that has revitalized cities such as New York and Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Baltimore is actively seeking to bring these people back, since their spending power could help restore neighborhoods, expand the economic base and energize what has been a tentative comeback for the 620,000-person city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Compared with rival cities that have enjoyed a renaissance, Baltimore's upper-middle class remains a relatively small slice of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nearly 43 percent of families in Washington proper earn at least $100,000, for example, compared with just 16 percent in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A greater share of families living in New York City, Boston and Richmond, Virginia, enjoy six-figure incomes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Baltimore has added nearly 4,000 upper middle-class families since 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But residents say the city lacks the critical mass of stable incomes to revive a city crushed by decades of neglect and poverty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Without a solid foundation of customers with money to spend, major retailers are less likely to invest in a community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Reports that the unrest damaged at least 350 businesses and televised images of a CVS pharmacy being looted were a reminder that vast stretches of the city contain few supermarkets, restaurants or stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"What's missing in a lot of these neighborhoods is real retail - opportunities to go shopping without having to get on two buses or walking a mile," said William H. Cole, president of the Baltimore Development Corporation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>New York, of course, has richly benefited as a global financial capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>And Washington has long prospered from government-related jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But as a longtime industrial port city that has lacked a base of higher-paying jobs, Baltimore has attempted a more difficult reinvention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Eric Hontz, a 33-year-old lawyer, moved from Washington two years ago to buy a home in the West Baltimore neighborhood of Reservoir Hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He has seen both worlds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I've heard people say that Baltimore is 30 miles to the North and 30 years behind D.C," Hontz said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"But we don't have the presence of the federal government as a safety net."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Census Bureau shows that Baltimore has added 3,700 families with incomes above $100,000 since 2010, gains that have helped pull many neighborhoods out of a decades-long slide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In Reservoir Hill, a community farm now fills a once vacant lot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Residents note proudly that the open-air drug market and drive-by shootings have given way to children bicycling along the streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The relative poverty just a few blocks away has made it easier for these families to buy homes that would be prohibitively expensive elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>From 2011 to 2013, Census figures show an additional 77 families with incomes above $200,000 settled in Baltimore's 21217 ZIP code, which includes Reservoir Hill and the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood where Gray lived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Hontz and his neighbors say they foresee the gains lasting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Yet any improvements that would further anchor growth and generate jobs for those living in comparative squalor depend on more people flowing back into previously abandoned neighborhoods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Hundreds of Gilded Age homes have slumped into seedy neglect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Here and there, new owners have restored the 15-feet tall molded ceilings, marble fireplace mantels and winding staircases to modern elegance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>When Robert Ginyard and his wife moved to Reservoir Hill more than a decade ago, five of the row houses on their street were being renovated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>For Ginyard, a 52-year-old married father of two who works for the city, the key was knowing that a group was rebuilding the neighborhood, rather than a few scattered pioneers and an occasional debt-fueled developer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"No one wants to be a lone ranger and go into a block where there are a majority of vacant" homes, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Whether the population growth can occur in sufficient numbers throughout the city remains far from clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has announced plans to add 10,000 families by 2020.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The city has added wealthier households, though it's actually shed 2,865 families since the mayor assumed office in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Baltimore does fare better in attracting families with six-figure incomes than such cities as Philadelphia and Cleveland, which are seeking to rebalance their economies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Additional possibilities for offices and shopping exist in Baltimore with sites such as the perpetually delayed $1.5 billion redevelopment of the Maryland government's State Center into a commercial, residential and retail sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"Until you get a certain magnitude of investment, it's hard to effect change," said Jacob Green, a software developer who lives in the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>In the blighted neighborhood of Sandtown-Winchester where Gray lived, the absence of nearby employers creates a dual curse: Few can find work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>And most who do endure exhaustingly long commutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The dynamic encourages residents to leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>As a result, around a third of the homes in the neighborhood are abandoned or boarded-up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Nearly half of Sandtown-Winchester residents earn less than $25,000, according to a report released this spring by the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>And more than a third of those with a job must commute at least 45 minutes each way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"It's really hard to argue with numbers," said Seema Iyer, a professor and director of the University of Baltimore's real estate and economic development program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"If we get to those much deeper problems, the crime will go away."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The challenge is finding ways to accelerate the turnaround in bringing back families so that those businesses and employers can open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Just two weeks after the protests and violence following Gray's death, nearly 270 potential homebuyers registered to spend their Saturday morning at a high school in West Baltimore to tour the neighborhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>More than 60 percent of them already lived in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Many seemed unfazed by the recent violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Some noted that living in Baltimore would shorten their commutes or allow them to achieve home ownership at a realistic price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Matt and Bridget Mendrygal knew they wanted to buy after moving down from Boston in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Unlike in many nearby cities along the Eastern Seaboard that have already gone through a cycle of revitalization, affordable home ownership remains a possibility in Baltimore.</td></tr>
