<h3>Zayn Malik quits One Direction's world tour</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It is unclear when he will return to One Direction, which made an estimated $75 million in 2014, according to Forbes magazine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Zayn has signed off with stress and is flying back to the U.K. to recuperate," the group's spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The band wish him well and will continue with their performances in Manila and Jakarta."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His stress may stem from a brewing controversy, which began after a photo appeared this week showing him in a nightclub in Thailand, holding hands with a young woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The woman, Lauren Robinson, 19, is not his fiancee, Perrie Edwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Wednesday night, Malik tweeted his love for Edwards, who is a member of Little Mix, a four-piece U.K. girl group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I'm 22 years old... I love a girl named Perrie Edwards," he tweeted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"And there's a lot of jealous [expletives] in this world I'm sorry for what it looks like x."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Malik is now reportedly flying back to England to be with Edwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That is, unless, he's flying to San Diego to be a special guest star with blink-182 at SOMA Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>(Accuracy alert! Malik is NOT flying to San Diego to sit in with blink, but, hey, why not?)</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>One Direction, or 1D, as their fans call them, will do the final few dates on the Asian leg of its "On the Road Again" world tour without Malik.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The group is the first ever to have its first four albums debut atop the Billboard album sales charts in the U.S. "Midnight Memories," One Direction's third album, was the biggest-selling album in the world of 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>With (and now without) Malik, the group's Philippines tour leg has had at least one other bump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Philippine Bureau of Immigration this week mandated that tour promoters post bonds worth nearly $5,000 each for Malik and One Direction member Louis Tomlinson, 23.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The bonds will be forfeited if either is caught using or in any way promoting illegal drugs while in Manila for their concerts there Saturday and Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Since Malik is en route to London, that puts the onus on Tomlinson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The (bond) condition is intended to protect the public interest should the band members commit any violation during their stay in the Philippines," said Elaine Tan, a Bureau of Immigration spokeswoman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>One Direction member Harry Styles, the subject of at least one scathing song by his former girlfriend, Taylor Swift, has not been implicated for promoting drug use or for being a fan of blink-182.</td></tr>
