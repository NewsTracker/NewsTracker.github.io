<h3>Netanyahu backtracks on election promise: ?I want a 2-state solution?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"I don't want a one-state solution. I want a sustainable, peaceful, two-state solution. But for that, circumstances have to change," he told MSNBC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"If you want to get peace you've got to get the Palestinian leadership to abandon their pact with Hamas and engage in genuine negotiations with Israel for an achievable peace."</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Netanyahu also had kind words for Obama - who still hasn't called to congratulate the prime minister on his come-from-behind victory on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I look forward to working with President Obama to see how we can advance our interest, our common interest, in the most difficult circumstances in the world, in the most dangerous region in the world," he told Fox.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He also warned about ISIS and Iran as threats that could fill a vacuum in occupied territories if Israel pulls out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The conditions in the Middle East have changed to the point where any territory we withdraw from is immediately taken up by Iranian-backed terrorists or by ISIS," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Meanwhile, tensions over the Obama-Netanyahu rift spilled over into a congressional hearing on Iran nuke negotiations.</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt court adjourns Al-Jazeera retrial to Wednesday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australian journalist Peter Greste, who was deported to his home country in February, is being tried in absentia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Also on trial are Canadian reporter Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian producer Baher Mohamed, as well as others, all of whom attended Thursday's hearing as free men after the judge released them at their first retrial hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greste, Fahmy and Mohamed, who are accused of "spreading false news" while covering demonstrations after the army ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, spent more than a year in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Last year, the trio were sentenced to from seven to 10 years in jail, but an appeals court in January granted them a retrial, saying the verdict had not been supported by evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Thursday, the court ordered creation of a new technical committee to review the videos used as prosecution evidence, said an AFP journalist who attended the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It also heard several witnesses, including a member of the technical committee whose testimony was used during the first trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The expert denied the conclusions of the technical report attributed to him that was used against the defendants in the first trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I did not write in the report if (the videos) are a threat to state security or not," Kamel Mohamed Kamel said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Some videos have been edited, but I can not say if they have altered the reality (of events) or not," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The journalists were arrested in December 2013 during a crackdown on Morsi's supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Their initial trial came against the backdrop of strained ties between Egypt and Qatar, where Al-Jazeera is based and which supported Morsi.</td></tr>
