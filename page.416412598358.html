<h3>Google now lets you download a list of every search you have ever made</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google has rolled out an update which allows users to download an archive of their entire online search history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Want to reminisce about the time you frantically scoured Google for homeopathic cures to your chesty-cough during the summer of 2008?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Or perhaps you want to look back fondly at the time you searched for the lyrics to Carly Rae Jepsen's seminal 2012 hit Call Me Maybe?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Luckily - Google has quietly rolled out a new update which lets you download an archive of every question you have ever asked the popular search engine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Downloading your search archive will generate a list of all your previous search terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Your search history will only contain queries made while signed-in with a Google Account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That means Incognito searches are not included within the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If you would rather delete your search history - Google has provided a walkthrough guide here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.</td></tr>
