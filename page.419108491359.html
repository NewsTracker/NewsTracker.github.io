<h3>Wacha wins 13th, Cardinals beat Reds 3-0 to take series (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CINCINNATI (AP) -- The mound was slippery, the rain was steady, the bullpen was exhausted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Michael Wacha overcame all of it for another win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Wacha gave St. Louis' tired bullpen a respite by throwing seven innings in the rain Thursday, and the Cardinals pulled away to a 3-0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds, taking yet another series from their NL Central rival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Cardinals improved to 30 games over .500 for the first time since the end of the 2013 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They have the best record in the major leagues at 69-39.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''It's August already,'' Wacha said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They took two of three in Cincinnati and have won 15 of their last 18 series together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Reds were shut out for the last 18 innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>St. Louis pulled out the second game of the series on Randal Grichuk's homer in the 13th inning for a 4-3 win on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Wacha (13-4) overcame a 68-minute rain delay at the start of Thursday's game, and then gave his used-up bullpen a rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''Absolutely had to happen,'' manager Mike Matheny said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The right-hander allowed four hits and a pair of walks, allowing only two runners to reach second base as he beat the Reds for the third time this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It was impressive considering the start of the game got pushed back twice and there were long delays between innings while the grounds crew worked on the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''It's pretty tough pitching in that kind of stuff, but we've got to deal with it,'' said Wacha, who threw 102 pitches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Trevor Rosenthal gave up an infield single and a walk in the ninth while getting his 32nd save in 34 chances and completing a five-hitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Tony Cruz snapped his 0-for-15 slump with an RBI single, and Kolten Wong singled home two more off Michael Lorenzen (3-7) as the teams played through intermittent, sometimes heavy rain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There was a long delay after the sixth inning to spread a drying compound around the infield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Lorenzen, one of five rookies in the Reds' rotation, gave up three runs in five innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He hasn't won since June 21, going 0-5 in seven starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In his last four starts, he's allowed 20 runs in 18 innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Grichuk went 0 for 4, ending his hitting streak at eight games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Cincinnati's Brandon Phillips extended his hitting streak to seven games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It was the Cardinals' 11th shutout of the season, fourth-most in the NL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Last year, they had 23 shutouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>... The Reds' streak of 18 innings without a run matches their longest of the season - they also did it in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>... Wacha has given up only two runs in 20 1-3 innings against the Reds this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It was the 13th rain delay at Great American Ball Park this season, totaling 18 hours, 41 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Cardinals: LF Stephen Piscotty was hit in the left thigh by one of Lorenzen's pitches while trying to bunt in the fifth inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He stayed in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Reds: CF Billy Hamilton got a day off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He has one hit in his last 15 at-bats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Cardinals: St. Louis goes to Milwaukee for a three-game series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Lance Lynn (8-6) is 7-3 career against the Brewers with a 2.53 ERA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The seven wins are his most against any opponent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Reds: Cincinnati starts a 10-game trip against the Diamondbacks, the Padres and the Dodgers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Raisel Iglesias (2-3) tries for his first back-to-back wins in the majors, making his first appearance against Arizona.</td></tr>
