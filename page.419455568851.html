<h3>Mexico's Treasury lowers GDP growth forecast to 2 to 2.8 pct</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - The Mexican Treasury Department is lowering its economic growth forecast for 2015 to between 2 percent and 2.8 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The new figure is down from a previous projection of 2.2 percent to 3.2 percent GDP growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Thursday's adjustment comes as the Mexican peso is at a historic low against the U.S. currency, closing at 16.52 per dollar the previous day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Analysts attribute the slide to an expected interest rate hike in the United States and lower prices for oil, a main driver of the Mexican economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mexico's central bank also recently lowered its own 2015 economic growth forecast, which is currently 1.7 percent to 2.5 percent.</td></tr>
