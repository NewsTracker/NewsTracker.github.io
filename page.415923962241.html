<h3>Series of deadly attacks in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A group loyal to "Islamic State" is thought to be behind the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At least seven Egyptian soldiers were killed on Thursday in attacks by suspected militants in the country's increasingly restive Sinai Peninsula, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Eight others were wounded in the apparently synchronized attacks, and the ensuing clashes with security forces claimed the lives of at least seven assailants as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gunmen opened fire on the soldiers at security checkpoints in Sheikh Zuweid and Rafah, the crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A third attack took place in northern Sinai, but the police did not specify where.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>No group immediately claimed responsibility, but jihadists who pledged allegiance to the "Islamic State" (IS) terrorist group last year have carried out similar operations in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sinai-based militants have killed hundreds of soldiers and police since the military ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013 following massive protests against his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This insurgency has spread to other parts of Egypt, though attacks in bigger cities and towns are usually far less dramatic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has spearheaded an Arab initiative to create a joint regional military force to confront the growing security threats posed by militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sisi has repeatedly cited the deteriorating situation in neighboring Libya as a significant security threat to his country.</td></tr>
