<h3>Marvin Gaye family seeks to stop 'Blurred Lines'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Los Angeles (AFP) - The family of Motown legend Marvin Gaye has asked a court to block further sales of smash hit "Blurred Lines" after a jury concluded that the song was plagiarized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gaye's estate on March 10 was awarded more than $7 million after convincing a jury that Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams' "Blurred Lines," the biggest hit of 2013, plagiarized the late singer's 1977 track "Got to Give It Up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a request for an injunction, the Gaye family asked a federal court in Los Angeles to halt all distribution of "Blurred Lines" and to bar Thicke and Williams from performing it in light of the landmark decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"A permanent injunction is justified because there is continued infringement of 'Got to Give It Up, " said the motion submitted Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The jury's award only applies to past sales of the infringing work and does not provide the Gayes a percentage of future sales and profit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The family said that it was not seeking to kill the song permanently but rather to negotiate terms for Gaye to share credit and revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The family rejected arguments that the verdict -- which looked, due to copyright law, at the sheet music for the two songs -- did not apply to the recording, saying that without the song, all label Interscope "would be distributing is a picture of Robin Thicke and a CD containing silence."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Thicke himself in media interviews before the court case had said that he had been inspired by Gaye.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the court decision has triggered an angry response from many songwriters, who note that there were major differences between the two songs, including the melodies and lyrics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Williams, a popular songwriter who had another smash hit with "Happy," said in an interview published Thursday that all creative people had inspirations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The verdict handicaps any creator out there who is making something that might be inspired by something else," Williams told the Financial Times.</td></tr>
