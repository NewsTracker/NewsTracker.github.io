<h3>Official: Fierce clashes, no major progress in operation to retake Iraq's Tikrit from IS group</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Soldiers found some 100 mines and bombs scattered along an 8-kilometer (5-mile) stretch of road on the way to this strategic city on the Tigris River, Salahuddin deputy governor Ammar Hikmat said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The discovery underlined how the battle likely will pivot on allied Iraqi forces' ability to counter such weapons, a mainstay of al-Qaida in Iraq, the Islamic State group's predecessor, as it fought American forces following their 2003 invasion of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The bombs are "the main obstacle in the way of the attacking forces, which have to wait for bomb experts or to go around the area," Hikmat told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"And this costs time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Extremists from the Islamic State group, which holds both a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in its self-declared caliphate, have littered major roadways and routes with mines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Such mines allow the extremists to slow any ground advance and require painstaking clearing operations before troops can safely move through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Suicide bombings also aid the militants in weakening Iraqi forces and have been used extensively in its failed campaign for the Syrian border town of Kobani.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Already, a militant website affiliated with the Islamic State group has said an American jihadi carried out a suicide attack with a truck bomb on the outskirts of the nearby city of Samarra, targeting Iraqi forces and Shiite militiamen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The posting identified him by the nom de guerre of Abu Dawoud al-Amriki, without elaborating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A suicide bomber also drove a military vehicle Tuesday afternoon into a checkpoint manned by government forces and Shiite fighters south of Tikrit, killing four troops and wounding 12, a police officer and a medical official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tuesday marked the second day of the Iraqi advance on Tikrit, with soldiers supported by Iranian-backed Shiite militias and advisers, along with some Sunni tribal fighters who reject the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hikmat estimated the Iraqi force besieging Tikrit at some 25,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Iran's semi-official Fars news agency has reported that Iranian Gen. Ghasem Soleimani, the commander of the country's elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, was taking part in the offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Government forces, however, made little headway Tuesday, two local officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They said fierce clashes struck mainly outside the town of al-Dour, south of Tikrit, while government troops shelled militant bases inside the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Those officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to brief journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Brig.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Gen. Saad Maan Ibrahim, an Interior Ministry spokesman, said explosive experts had disabled "so many bombs and car bombs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Tikrit has been besieged from three directions, from the north, west and south, but what has remained only from the eastern side," Ibrahim said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"The explosive experts were able to tackle so many bombs and car bombs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Hikmat said the offensive had killed and wounded "dozens" of Islamic State extremists, but that the attacking forces also have been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Authorities in Baghdad offered no immediate casualty figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Past attempts to retake Tikrit have failed, as Iraq struggles with a military that collapsed last summer during the Islamic State militants' lightning offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Tikrit operation is seen as a litmus test for the capability of Iraqi troops to dislodge the militants from major cities they conquered in the country's Sunni heartland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Retaking Tikrit, the provincial capital of Salahuddin province, some 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Baghdad, would help Iraqi forces secure a major supply link for any future operation to capture Mosul, the country's second-largest city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>U.S. military officials have said a coordinated military mission to retake Mosul will likely begin in April or May and involve up to 25,000 Iraqi troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But the Americans have cautioned that if the Iraqis aren't ready, the offensive could be delayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>On Monday, Iraqi and U.S. officials said the U.S.-led coalition was not involved in the Tikrit operation and had not been asked to carry out airstrikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Overall, coalition airstrikes have killed more than 8,500 Islamic State fighters since its campaign began in August, said Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, the commander of U.S. Central Command.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"The fact is that (the group) can no longer do what (it) did at the outset, which is to seize and to hold new territory," Austin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>As the Tikrit battle rages, Iraq remains bitterly split between minority Sunnis, who were an important base of support for Saddam, and the Shiite majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Since Saddam was toppled and later executed, the Sunni minority has felt increasingly marginalized by the Shiite-led government in Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In 2006, long-running tensions boiled over into sectarian violence that claimed tens of thousands of lives.</td></tr>

<h3>Nigeria's Boko Haram releases beheading video echoing Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The film, released on Monday, shows militants standing behind the two men who are on their knees, hands tied behind their backs, with one man standing over them, holding a knife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One of the kneeling men is made to tell the camera that they were paid by authorities to spy on the militant group, before the film moves to another scene showing their decapitated bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was not possible to confirm the film's authenticity or date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The footage will raise concerns that Boko Haram, which evolved out of a clerical movement focused on northeast Nigeria, is expanding its scope and seeking inspiration from international militant networks including al Qaeda and Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan has said Boko Haram is allied to both al Qaeda and IS, though that has not been confirmed by Boko Haram itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The group previously had links to al Qaeda and though Boko Haram and IS have acknowledged each other, the Nigerian militants have not officially pledged allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"(Boko Haram) does refer to its fighters as soldiers of the Caliphate, and pro-IS jihadists worldwide now refer to it as the Caliphate's link in Nigeria," Laith Alkhouri, director of Middle East and North Africa research and jihadi threat intelligence at Flashpoint Partners, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Boko Haram has killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds in its bid to carve out an Islamist state in its homeland, and in recent months has increased cross-border raids into Cameroon, Chad and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The group came to control an area the size of Belgium but the Nigerian army, helped by Chadian troops, has recaptured some territory in the last few weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Nigeria attracted international criticism for postponing its Feb. 14 presidential election by six weeks for security reasons linked to the insurgency, an excuse viewed as political interference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The improved video quality comes soon after the group began to establish a social media presence this year through a communications unit, Al-Urwa Al-Wuthqa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Previously, Boko Haram would leak videos to selected journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The media unit opened its first Twitter account in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It was shut down and replaced on March 1 by a new one, where it has begun publishing videos and statements in English, French and Arabic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It would be difficult to determine whether the Twitter accounts are authentic or represent only a faction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But the move mimics IS, which has waged a strong campaign on the platform and had many accounts shut down, Mark Singleton, director of the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism in The Hague, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Not surprisingly they are trying to emulate IS where they can," Singleton said, "Beheadings have proven their media value ... apparently that's the way to get people's attention."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>After taking over swathes on Iraq and Syria, Islamic State gained further notoriety by posting a video showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley in August followed by several more similar executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Boko Haram film's use of graphics, the footage of black-clad militants with a black flag, and the editing to show only the aftermath of the beheading, were similar to material from Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In the video, one of the victims says he comes from Baga in Borno state, and says the other is from Michika in Adamawa state, both areas where the army says it has recently recaptured territory from Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Past Boko Haram films have been much cruder affairs, often featuring a man identified as their leader Abubakar Shekau talking more about local complaints than global jihad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A number of recent releases have included much more gruesome footage of beheadings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The latest video, entitled "Harvest of Spies", includes introductory animation with streaming computer code on a purple background before the start of the main event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"(It) mimics the production of many IS videos ... the suspenseful slow motion scenes, the beheading of the individuals after confession of so called crimes, and the multilingual aspect including subtitles," Alkhouri of Flashpoint said.</td></tr>
