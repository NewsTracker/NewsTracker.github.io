<h3>Lakeside communities in Chad live in fear of Boko Haram after new wave of attacks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Crying "Allahu akbar" or God is Great into the pre-dawn darkness, they opened fire indiscriminately and burned scores of mud-brick houses with gasoline, killing at least eight civilians and two security officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nearly six years into its insurgency in Nigeria, the Islamic extremist group is now attacking villages in the other countries bordering Lake Chad - Chad, Niger and Cameroon - and local officials say the motive is greed, not a drive to establish an Islamic caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some 3,400 Nigerian refugees had been living in N'gouboua at the time of the Feb. 13 attack and all have since been relocated further inland to a camp jointly run by the U.N. and the government of Chad, a predominantly Muslim country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Journalists who visited N'gouboua on Thursday saw traumatized and scared residents and nearly a dozen destroyed vehicles and motorcycles in the sand-blanketed streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The extremists had also set the town's sole mosque ablaze.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Adam Dogo, a town resident, pointed to the charred woven mats that once formed the mosque's ceiling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The call to prayer is muted now that the mosque's speaker has gone up in flames.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The floor where men once prayed is covered in ash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"What kind of Muslim sets a mosque on fire?" he asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The Boko Haram are against Islam."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>During the attack, Dogo's son, Ndingou, fled into a house to hide along with several other children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Boko Haram militants torched their hiding spot and it wasn't long before one of the girls burned to death beside him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ndingou was afraid of dying or being kidnapped by Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I saw her body and I thought there was no way out," he recalled, his ears and the soles of feet badly burned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I thought it was the end and I was going to die, but if they took me with them I would die too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Chadian troops have stepped up their patrols though this lakeside community remains vulnerable to further attacks by militants in motorboats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Only the day before, there was another attack on a village just 15 kilometers (nine miles) away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>More than 200 Boko Haram militants ultimately were repelled by Chadian forces there, said local police commissioner Idriss Ibrahim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The heavily armed militants arrived in four boats with weapons including AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades he suspects were stolen from the Nigerian military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Some of the militants are now believed to be based on a Nigerian island in the lake though have used several other mostly abandoned islands on the Chadian side to launch their assaults.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Authorities suspect some Chadians are giving them information since the highest-ranking local official was among those killed in N'gouboua.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"They clearly knew how to enter the village, where the army was based," said Dimouya Souapebe, the chief civil servant in Baga Sola region of Chad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"They knew where to attack, where to hit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Some suspected collaborators already have been rounded up by the local authorities, and police are asking people to report suspicious strangers on the Chadian side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>While Boko Haram's leaders says it is attacking Chad and other neighboring countries because they support a regional military effort against the group, local authorities believe the group is motivated by greed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As northeastern Nigeria - where Boko Haram has traditionally been based - becomes increasingly isolated, the fighters are pillaging wherever they go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"They don't have gas for their boats or medicine so they terrorize people so that they flee and they can take their things," Souapebe says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Piles of burned fabric, tea pots and other destroyed household goods litter the sandy yard in front of El-hadji Mbodou Zezerti's home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The 78-year-old fled N'gouboua when he heard the pre-dawn gunfire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>His wife and four of his children made it to safety, though 10-year-old Falmata was missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>When the family finally returned to the village two weeks later, they found her charred body inside their home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Abakar Adoum, 34, lost his oldest brother that day, his throat slit when he encountered the militants while trying to flee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The children aren't sleeping, and there is little to eat in town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Our wives are afraid to sleep at night," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"I never thought Boko Haram would come here, and now we are afraid that they will come back. They must be eliminated."</td></tr>
