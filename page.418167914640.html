<h3>France links beheading, gas plant attack to Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>French investigators have uncovered links between Islamic State militants and the man who hung his employer's severed head at a gas plant he was attacking, a prosecutor said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The man, Yassin Salhi, has said he was acting purely for personal reasons when he beheaded his boss after being reprimanded for dropping equipment from a pallet, according to his lawyer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But prosecutor Francois Molins said his acts went well beyond a simple workplace dispute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With a long-bladed knife and a gun in hand - as well as two brand new flags emblazoned with the Muslim declaration of faith, Salhi tricked his boss into getting into the van, knocked him unconscious and strangled him, Molins said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>About 500 meters (a quarter-mile) before reaching the plant, he decapitated his victim, and then almost immediately sent two photos of the remains to a friend in Syria: One was a selfie, and the other included an image of the severed head placed carefully on the torso.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Then Salhi, a truck driver with a history of radical Islamic ties dating back to 2003, drove into the plant filled with flammable gas canisters, Molins said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>When he was tackled by firefighters responding to the explosion and blaze, he cried out Allahu akbar, the Arabic phrase for "God is great," Molins said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In a subsequent message, the friend, a Frenchman identified as Sebastien Younes who has been in Syria since November, indicated he was in contact with Islamic State higher-ups about the images.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Yassin Salhi beheaded his victim before hanging his head to the factory fence in an effort to give maximum publicity to his act - he admitted to it during his interrogation," Molins said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This bears the trademark of the Islamic State group's propaganda which regularly calls for terrorist attacks to be carried out in France and more specifically, to slit unbelievers' throats."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Salhi was seized by firefighters at the Air Products chemicals warehouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>According to Molins, Salhi said he neither remembers the beheading nor sending photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"According to him, his motive was only personal and not terrorist. One does not exclude the other," Molins said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Molins has requested preliminary terrorism charges to be filed against Salhi and has opened a formal terrorism investigation, including into his ties with Younes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Molins said investigators recovered a message in which Younes appeared to be claiming responsibility for inspiring his friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Air Products officials have said Salhi made regular deliveries to the site in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, near Lyon, and had never caused problems in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Friday attack came days after Islamic State militants urged followers to strike during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.</td></tr>
