<h3>More than 3,200 confirmed dead in Nepal earthquake</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The official death toll in Nepal following a 7.9 magnitude earthquake at the weekend has risen to 3,218.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The toll for Nepal had previously stood at 2,430.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Around 90 people are also known to have died in neighbouring countries, including India and China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hundreds of Nepalis were fleeing the capital Kathmandu for the plains after two days of powerful aftershocks and faced with shortages of food and water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Roads leading out of the mountain valley city of one million were jammed with people, many with babies in their arms, trying to climb onto buses or hitch a ride aboard cars and trucks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Many said they had slept in the open since Saturday's quake, either because their homes were flattened or they were terrified that the aftershocks would bring them crashing down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Overwhelmed authorities were trying to cope with a shortage of drinking water and food, as well as the threat of disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The sick and wounded were lying out in the open in Kathmandu, unable to find beds in the devastated city's hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Surgeons set up an operating theatre inside a tent in the grounds of Kathmandu Medical College.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In the Himalayas, hundreds of foreign and Nepali climbers were trapped after a huge avalanche ripped through the Mount Everest base camp, killing 17 people in the single worst disaster to hit the world's highest mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Across Kathmandu and beyond, exhausted families laid mattresses out on streets and erected tents to shelter from rain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>People queued for water dispensed from the back of trucks, while the few shops still open had next to nothing on their shelves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>More than 6,500 were injured in Saturday's earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Another 66 were killed across the border in India and at least another 20 in Tibet, China's state news agency said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Nearly a million children have been "severely affected" by the earthquake, a spokesman for the United Nations Children's Fund said, as rescue and aid workers struggle to cope.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>UNICEF said its relief workers were watching for waterborne and infectious diseases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"What we know that at this point is there are nearly a million children who are severely affected. Our biggest concern for them right now is going to be access to clean water and sanitation, we know that water and food is running out," UNICEF's Christopher Tidey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The toll is likely to rise as rescuers struggle to reach remote regions in the impoverished, mountainous country of 28 million people and as bodies buried under rubble are recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>With so many people sleeping in the open with no power or water and downpours forecast, fears mounted of major food and water shortages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Across Nepal, hundreds of villages have been left to fend for themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Several countries rushed to send aid and personnel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>India flew in medical supplies and members of its National Disaster Response Force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>China sent a 60-strong emergency team.</td></tr>

<tr><td>26</td><td>Australia, Britain and New Zealand said they were sending specialist urban search-and-rescue teams to Kathmandu at Nepal's request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Britain, which believes several hundred of its nationals are in Nepal, was also delivering supplies and medics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>However, there has been little sign of international assistance on the ground so far, with some aid flights prevented from landing by aftershocks that closed Kathmandu's main airport several times yesterday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In the Himalayas, hundreds of climbers felt tremors yesterday powerful enough to send snow and boulders cascading towards them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Another was felt early this morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A Co Antrim man in Nepal has described the situation in Kathmandu as "ugly" and "very tense".</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Barry Torrens from Portrush, who has had been trekking in Nepal, said there is no electricity anywhere in Kathmandu except a couple of the larger embassies, which have generators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He said the loss of power and communications is one thing, but "it's a very different matter running out of water".</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Speaking on RTE's Morning Ireland, he said there are a "tremendous amount of gangs of people, locals roaming the city looking for water."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>He said they were able to buy some water first thing yesterday morning, but all the shops had run out by noon local time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Mr Torrens said he along with 200 other people are sitting in the garden of the British Embassy where they had sought shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He said they slept outside their accommodation on Saturday night and there were aftershocks every two to three hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Mountain rescue teams, helped by clear weather, used helicopters to airlift climbers stranded for two days at high altitude on Mount Everest after the earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Romanian climber Alex Gavan said on Twitter that three helicopters had reached camps one and two, which are at altitudes of more than 6,000 metres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Each helicopter is only capable of carrying two climbers due to the thin air, Mr Gavan said from base camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, a climber from Denmark, posted a video on Facebook showing a helicopter landing to evacuate two climbers and then taking off again 30 seconds later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Survivors on Everest described a cloud of rock and ice that smashed into base camp on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>More than 60 people were injured, leading climbers to send frantic messages calling for helicopter assistance to evacuate the wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>An estimated 100 climbers and guides were safe but trapped at both camps which rendered the treacherous Khumbu icefalls leading up to them from base camp impassable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Japan's foreign ministry on Monday said a Japanese man was among those killed on the Everest, the fourth foreign national claimed by the avalanche.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Three Americans were killed, the US State Department said yesterday, including a Google engineer, a medic and a filmmaker.</td></tr>
