<h3>Google data on driverless car accidents made public</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google said it would give monthly updates of accidents involving its driverless cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The report for May showed Google cars had been involved in 12 accidents since the company first began testing its self-driving cars in 2009, mostly involving rear-ending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Google said one of its vehicles was rear-ended at a stoplight in California on Thursday, bringing the total count to 13 accidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"That could mean that the vehicles tend to stop more quickly than human drivers expect," public interest group Consumer Watchdog said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A Google spokeswoman said the consumer watchdog conclusion was erroneous because most of the rear-end accidents occurred when the vehicle was stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Consumer Watchdog called for more details on the accidents, including statements from witnesses and other drivers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>None of these accidents were caused by a fault with the car, Google said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Google's self-driving-car program director, Chris Urmson, said in May that the cars have been involved in 11 accidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The accidents mostly involved Google's self-driving Lexus RX450h sport utility vehicles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google is about to take its pod-like prototype vehicles off the test track and on to Mountain View, California, roads this summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The company described the two-seater car as "the world's first fully self-driving vehicle."</td></tr>
