<h3>Zayn Malik quits 1D: The most apoplectic Twitter reactions from Directioners</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Zayn Malik has quit One Direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That 50ft bronze statue of him in Leicester Square will have to be torn down, and Zaynville will have to be switched back to its original name of Stoke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Fans are beside themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>How can the time space continuum continue to function when there are four members of One Direction instead of five?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Here are a selection of the most crazed reactions, which I will be updating as they come in until we have something resembling a post-modern art piece about 21st century hyperbole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>THIS IS NOT FUNNY!</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>ZAYN MALIK LEAVING ONE DIRECTION!</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>@zaynmalik Zayn please don't leave me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Don't leave us please.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Finally, apropos nothing, here's my favourite piece of Zayn Malik fan fiction.</td></tr>
