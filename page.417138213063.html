<h3>Tunisia museum terror attack suspect arrested in Italy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ROME - Italian police have arrested a Moroccan man on suspicion he helped organize and execute the March 18 attack on Tunisia's Bardo Museum that left 22 people dead, authorities said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Abdelmajid Touil was arrested Tuesday night on a Tunisian arrest warrant at the home of his mother and two brothers in Gaggiano, near Milan, anti-terrorism investigator Bruno Megale told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The only trace that Italian authorities had of Touil prior to his arrest was that he had arrived in Italy on Feb. 17 along with migrants from a smuggler's boat, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He was identified by authorities in Porto Empedocle, Sicily, and was subsequently issued an expulsion decree, Megale said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Those decrees are usually given to migrants heading to Europe for economic reasons - not refugees from conflict who could apply for asylum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It's not clear when or if he left Italy or how he might have returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Italian police, however, believe he went to back to Tunisia to help organize the March 18 attack in Tunis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Anti-immigrant politicians have warned that Islamic extremists might enter Italy via any one of the dozens of migrant boats setting off weekly from Libya for European shores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Confirmation that Abdelmajid had made at least one trip to Italy by boat has fueled criticism of the massive, Italy-led Mediterranean operation to rescue would-be refugees crossing the Mediterranean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The accusations in the Tunisian arrest warrant against Touil include premeditated murder, conspiracy to commit attacks against the state, belonging to a terrorist group and recruiting and training others to commit terrorist attacks, Megale said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He was wanted internationally for co-participation in, planning and executing the March 18 attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunis," Megale said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for attacking the Bardo, Tunisia's leading historical museum, which has a trove of Roman mosaics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Gunmen opened fire on tourists getting out of buses and then entered the museum and fired on more tourists inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Two gunmen were killed in a shootout with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A number of people have been arrested in connection with the Bardo attack, but the Tunisian interior ministry has said the mastermind of the attack is still at large.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Tunisian authorities do not think Abdelmajid is that mastermind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But the spokesman for Tunisia's interior ministry, Mohammed Ali Aroui, confirmed that Abdelmajid was the subject of an international arrest warrant for his involvement in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"He participated indirectly in the attack, supporting the ones who carried it out," he told The Associated Press, adding that authorities were now working on Abdelmajid's extradition to Tunisia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Two Moroccans were involved in the Bardo attack as well as two Algerians, added Aroui, although the killing was only carried out by the two Tunisian shooters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Some 20 people have been arrested in connection with the Bardo attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ten days after it took place, security forces in southern Tunisia killed nine militants led by an Algerian that the government has also linked to the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Italian police said they were able to identify Touil in part after his mother reported that her son's passport was missing immediately after the Bardo attack.</td></tr>
