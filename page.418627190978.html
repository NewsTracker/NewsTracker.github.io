<h3>Baltimore officers claim they gave statements under duress</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - Lawyers for three of the Baltimore police officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray have argued in court filings that their clients gave initial statements under duress because they were afraid of being fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Baltimore Sun (http://bsun.md/1Iaf5WT) reports that the attorneys made those arguments in motions filed this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Gray's death following a neck injury he suffered in police custody in April provoked widespread unrest in the city, and the National Guard was called in to restore order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Baltimore police practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Two of the officers claimed in their motions they thought they were being interviewed as witnesses rather than suspects in Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Their attorneys are asking for those statements to be thrown out.</td></tr>
