<h3>Family believes Tony Stewart lost his temper in fatal crash (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The parents of a sprint car driver struck and killed last year by Tony Stewart believe a wrongful death lawsuit is the only way to hold the NASCAR star accountable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pamela and Kevin Ward Sr. said Friday on ''Good Morning America'' they want ''justice'' for their 20-year-old son.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''That's what we want,'' Pamela Ward said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''I don't feel Tony meant to kill my son.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But his actions killed my son.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kevin Ward Jr. was killed last August at Canandaigua (N.Y.) Motorsports Park when he exited his car under caution in an apparent attempt to confront Stewart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As Ward Jr. walked down the track, he was struck by Stewart's car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''Tony races every weekend,'' Kevin Ward Sr. said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''Well I know my son will never get to race again.</td></tr>
