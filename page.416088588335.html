<h3>Hillary Clinton hires Google's Stephanie Hannon for attracting voters</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Clinton is deadly serious about attracting young and tech-savvy voters in 2016, hiring a new digital guru who hails from the world's most powerful online brand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Stephanie Hannon, who was the tech giant's director of productmanagement for civic innovation and social impact, will serve as her presidential campaign's chief technology officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In that role she will supervise a sprawling effort to develop websites, mobile apps and other vehicles for pushing the former secretary of state's brand through the 2016 elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hannon previously worked on Gmail and Google Maps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She also spent some time at Facebook, and also worked for the event-organizing website Eventbrite, according to her LinkedIn profile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Seasoned digital talent is in high demand as nearly 20 potential White House hopefuls plan for a 2016 campaign season that will rely heavily on clicks, likes, shares and other indications of a broad reach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Every major party candidate will have to navigate the brave new world of online fundraising, too, which President Barack Obama's team mastered in 2008 en route to his victory - including a stunning Democratic primary upset of Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who announced his candidacy on Tuesday in Louisville, poached his tech leader from rival candidate Ted Cruz late last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Vincent Harris, who also helped manicure Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell's online image during a bruising re-election fight in 2014, runs his own Texas consulting firm with a staff of 20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His team was responsible for McConnell's breakthrough video 'What rhymes with Alison Lundergan Grimes,' a brief online ad that launched a year-long slap-fest directed at McConnell's unsuccessful challenger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Washington Post was first to report Clinton's latest hire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The onetime first lady and former U.S. senator hasn't yet launched an official campaign, but an announcement is expected in the next 10 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Her campaign-in-waiting has already signed a lease for two floors of a Brooklyn, New York, office building, starting a 15-day countdown for a formal declaration of her candidacy set by the Federal Election Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Clinton's staff also includes several key members who came over from the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Kristina Schake was first lady Michelle Obama's aide responsible for recasting her as a fun-loving 'everywoman' through TV appearances on pop-culture shows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She will help transform Clinton into a softer, more accessible public figure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>White House Communications Director Jen Palmieri stepped down this month to helm Clinton's campaign communications team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Palmieri has been replaced by Jen Psaki, the former State Department chief spokeswoman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It's unclear whether Hannon will be able to help Clinton shed her image as a ham-fisted and digitally aloof schemer, a reputation that has followed her since a scandal broke over emails she deleted froma private server she maintained during her years in the Obama administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Questions remain about whether Clinton acted improperly when she conducted all her State Department email communications on a home-brew system completely separate from government computers and the archiving required by federal law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>South Carolina Republican Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Trey Gowdy, at the helm of a special congressional committee tasked with investigating the deadly 2012 terror attacks at a State Department facility in Benghazi, Libya, did not respond to a request for comment about the status of the probe into Clinton's emails.</td></tr>
