<h3>Isis affiliate claims responsibility for rocket attack on Egyptian navy ship</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An Islamic State affiliate has said it fired a rocket at an Egyptian naval vessel in the Mediterranean Sea near the coast of Israel and the Gaza Strip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Photographs distributed online on Thursday by the militant group Sinai Province appear to show a rocket heading towards a ship and setting it on fire on impact.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>Egypt's military said in a statement that a coastguard launch had exchanged shots with "terrorist elements", causing it to catch fire, but there was no loss of life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Such incidents at sea are rare, but Egypt is battling an increasingly brazen Islamist insurgency in the Sinai peninsula, which lies between Israel, the Gaza Strip and the Suez Canal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sinai Province, the most lethal militant group in Egypt, last year pledged loyalty to Isis, which controls large tracts of territory in Syria and Iraq and has a presence in Egypt's neighbour Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It has recently carried out high-profile attacks which prompted the drafting of a sweeping counter-terrorism law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The authorities said 100 militants and at least 17 security personnel were killed in a single day of clashes and attacks claimed by Sinai Province on 1 July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A witness in Gaza saw a plume of dark grey smoke rising from a boat off the coast.</td></tr>
