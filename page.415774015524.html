<h3>Germanwings flight 4U9525 crash: captain reportedly tried to force way through cockpit door with axe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Disturbingly, it was post 9/11 cockpit safety procedures that helped him do it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Berlin: The captain locked out of the cockpit of the Germanwings plane that crashed in the French Alps reportedly used an axe to try to force his way back in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>French prosecutors believe co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately flew the jet into the side of a remote mountain after denying the captain access, killing himself and all 149 others aboard on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They say the cockpit flight recorder shows the captain repeatedly knocked and tried to get back in as the plane went into its fatal descent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, German daily Bild reported on Friday that he also tried using an axe to break down the armoured door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Germanwings has confirmed an axe was on board the aircraft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The budget carrier said on Thursday it was also equipped with a video surveillance system that allowed someone wanting to enter the cockpit to be identified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Only a pilot inside can unlock the door," a spokesperson added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The system was widely adopted after planes were used in the September 11 attacks that killed almost 3000 people in New York and Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The European air safety agency EASA and US counterpart the FAA told the airline industry in the wake of the 2001 catastrophe to find ways to prevent the takeover of passenger planes, even under the threat of deadly force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The systems differ according to each plane and airline to avoid a standard and prevent would-be terrorists from knowing how they work from one carrier or plane to another," a sector specialist who asked not to be identified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Germanwings planes require an access code to open the door but the airline, which is owned by Lufthansa, did not wish on Thursday to give details "for security reasons".</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The sector specialist said a separate code sets off a signal to ask that the door be opened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>If no one inside the cockpit responds, the door is unlocked automatically a minute later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Cockpit access can nonetheless still be prevented in such cases if a pilot determines that protecting the plane's controls is the top priority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The video camera allows the pilot or co-pilot to see what is happening on the other side of the door, and they have a switch that can block access "with the aim of preventing an illicit act", Boeing 737 pilot Daphne Desrosiers told a French radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Yet another secret code triggers a stronger signal but if the person inside the cockpit is determined to prevent access, it is not possible to enter, the sector specialist said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A Lufthansa spokesperson confirmed the cockpit door could only be unlocked "from inside the cockpit by pressing a button".</td></tr>
