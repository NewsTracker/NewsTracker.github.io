<h3>Yahoo says IRS statement won?t stop its spin-off</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Yahoo said Wednesday it will move forward with its plans to spin off its small business division, despite the IRS announcing it will reexamine its rules for spin-offs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yahoo said its understanding is that the statement from the IRS was "not specific" to its spin-off plans and "reflects no change in applicable law and does not affect previously filed ruling requests."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yahoo filed its request for the spin-off in the first quarter and plans to separate its small business division, along with shares in Alibaba, into a new company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The move would allow Yahoo to avoid paying $16 billion in tax liabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some investors were skittish on Tuesday after the IRS statement, which would apply to new spin-off requests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Yahoo's stock plunged nearly 8 percent to $40.98 at the market's close Tuesday, its lowest stock price since last October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>By Wednesday midday, Yahoo stock was up about 5 percent, trading at $42.98 a share.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Meanwhile, Yahoo has been hiring more engineers for its small business division and working with a strategic branding company on the spin-off's name.</td></tr>
