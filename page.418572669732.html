<h3>MH17 anniversary: Vladimir Putin calls tribunal into the disaster 'counterproductive'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Vladimir Putin has rejected proposals for an international tribunal into the MH17 air disaster, in the clearest sign yet that Russia may veto a resolution on the plans at the UN Security Council next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a telephone conversation with Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, Mr Putin said that establishing an international tribunal to prosecute those behind the downing of Flight MH17 over Ukraine would be &#x201c;counterproductive&#x201d; and &#x201c;premature&#x201d;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Vladimir Putin in detail explained the Russian position regarding the premature and counterproductive nature of an initiative by a number of countries, including the Netherlands, to establish an international tribunal to criminally prosecute individuals responsible for the destruction of the Malaysian airliner," the Kremlin said following the call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was destroyed over eastern Ukraine on July 17 last year, killing all 298 people on board, including 10 Britons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Netherlands, which lost 193 citizens in the disaster, is leading two separate international enquiries into the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The first, led by the Dutch Safety Board, is expected to report in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The second, a criminal investigation by Australian, Belgian, Dutch, Malaysian, and Ukrainian detectives, is expected to run on at least to the end of the year and will produce a dossier outlining charges of murder and possibly war crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A Malaysian proposal for a tribunal, backed by all the countries involved in the joint criminal investigation, is expected to be debated at the United Nations Security council on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Russian diplomats have hinted they will veto the proposals, arguing that the question of a tribunal should be postponed until after the Dutch-led investigations have reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The contents of the Safety Board report has not been made public, but CNN reported on Wednesday that a draft version blames separatists firing a surface-to-air missile, citing sources who had seen the document.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An independent investigation by the Telegraph published on Thursday suggests separatists fired a Buk SA-11 missile from a position south of the rebel-held town of Snizhne, after mistaking MH17 for a Ukrainian jet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Wednesday, the families of 18 victims filed a $900 million lawsuit in a Chicago court against Igor Girkin, the former Russian intelligence officer who was in command of separatist forces at the time, who they say orchestrated the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A spokesman for Mr Girkin, who also goes by the nom-de-guerre Igor Strelkov, declined to comment on the allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Officials from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&#x2019;s Republic (DNR) deny possessing technology capable of destroying the airliner, and blame Ukraine for the shooting down of the plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Meanwhile, Russia&#x2019;s civilian aviation agency said it would prepare its own investigation, the conclusions of which would be released following the official Dutch-led reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>&#x201c;Russia has never pushed its own version of events, but has simply called for all possibilities to be considered,&#x201d; Oleg Storchevoy, the deputy head of Rosaviatsia, said at a press conference in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said the agency had submitted information to the official enquiries and also offered to carry out analysis of sub-munitions and shrapnel fragments found amongst the wreckage of the airliner to determine the &#x201c;exact type of missile involved".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>&#x201c;We are ready to carry out all the necessary studies in the presence of experts from all countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>We have nothing to hide,&#x201d; he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The call to investigate &#x201c;all possible scenarios&#x201d; came a day after Russia&#x2019;s chief criminal investigator appeared to resurrect the theory &#x2013; widely rejected by Western experts &#x2013; that MH17 was downed by a Ukrainian fighter jet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>&#x201c;We have information, including based on expert analysis, that the aircraft was shot down by an air-to-air rocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Furthermore, experts have established the kind of rocket and it is not of Russian make,&#x201d; Vladimir Markin, the head of the investigative committee, told the Interfax news agency on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mr Markin said the finding confirmed testimony from a former Ukrainian air force mechanic, Yevgeny Agapov, who the investigative committee has previously cited to support that claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The theory contradicts a report released last month by Almaz-Antey, the Russian company that builds Buk missiles, which said MH17 was shot down by a specific model of the Buk M1 anti-aircraft missile known to be used by the Ukrainian armed forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Almaz-Antey said the missile model involved, the 9M38M1, went out of production in 1999 and that the Russian armed forces had since sold off their inventory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It also said the missile was fired from an area that the DNR claims was under Ukrainian control at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Independent experts have broadly agreed with Almaz-Anetey&#x2019;s identification of the missile, but have questioned both the claim that Russia no longer posses that model and the methodology leading to their suspected launch site.</td></tr>
