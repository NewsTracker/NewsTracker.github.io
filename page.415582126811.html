<h3>Pelosi: Republican inquiry on Clinton hypocritical</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nancy Pelosi of Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>speaks during her weekly news conference in Washington, Thursday, March 19, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday mocked a Republican investigation of Hillary Rodham Clinton's email practices, calling it part of an ongoing attempt to investigate Clinton, "whether it's her emails or it's her hair."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Pelosi accused House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans of hypocrisy in calling for Clinton to turn over her email server to a neutral third party, since no similar demands were made of other secretaries of state, including Republican Colin Powell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The GOP-led inquiry "isn't really about emails," Pelosi said, but instead is a partisan investigation by a select committee that has spent millions of dollars and produced "nothing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Pelosi was referring to an inquiry by a special committee investigating the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, which occurred while Clinton was serving as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The panel's chairman, Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., has issued a subpoena for Clinton's emails and other documents related to Benghazi attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He says he wants Clinton, a likely presidential candidate, to testify before his panel at least twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Clinton has said she relied on personal emails as the nation's top diplomat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She says the server "will remain private."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Pelosi told reporters Thursday that it's a mistake for the Benghazi panel or any other committee "to continue a political investigation of Hillary Clinton. And that's what they seem to do. It seems to me a big waste of taxpayer money."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In order to be fair to Clinton, the GOP should look at email practices of former secretaries of states dating back to 2000, Pelosi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Even if you just said in this century where technology has moved forward ... I would say let's see what other secretaries of state (have done), what their practices" were, Pelosi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Maybe that would be an interesting contrast."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Although email practices varied among her predecessors, Clinton is the only secretary of state known to have conducted all official unclassified government business on a private email address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Powell has said he used both a government and a private email account when he served as secretary of state from 2001 to 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Thursday, Boehner again urged Clinton to turn over her server for an independent review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We need the secretary to do the right thing here, so that we can get to the facts about what happened before, during and after an attack on our people," Boehner said.</td></tr>

<h3>Judge OKs $10 million settlement in Target data breach</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson granted preliminary approval of the settlement after a hearing Thursday in St. Paul, Minnesota.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The move will allow people to begin filing claims ahead of another hearing for final approval, which was scheduled for Nov. 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>People affected by the breach can file for up to $10,000 with proof of their losses, including unauthorized charges, higher fees or interest rates, and lost time dealing with the problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Target really needs to be commended for being willing to step up," Magnuson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Target's data breach in 2013 exposed details of as many as 40 million credit and debit card accounts and hurt its holiday sales that year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company offered free credit monitoring for affected customers and overhauled its security systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The settlement would also require Minneapolis-based Target to appoint a chief information security officer, keep a written information security program and offer security training to its workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It would be required to maintain a process to monitor for data security events and respond to such events deemed to present a threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We are pleased to see the process moving forward and look forward to its resolution," Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in an emailed statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Claims will mostly be submitted and processed online through a dedicated website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Vincent Esades, an attorney for Target customers, said after the hearing that the settlement could end up costing Target $25 million, when attorneys' fees and administrative costs are added in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said consumers will likely be able to start filing claims around April 30, and 100 million people may be eligible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Consumers can claim up to $10,000 if they can document unreimbursed losses; after those claims are paid out, the rest of the settlement funds will be divided among consumers who state under oath that they suffered a qualifying loss, but don't have documentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>People who've already been fully reimbursed aren't eligible, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Esades said customers who opt out of the settlement have the right to object.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Since the funds can't be paid out until all appeals are resolved, he said, the earliest that customers would see any money would be early next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Target attorney David McDowell declined to comment after the hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The chain has worked hard to lure back customers that were hesitant to shop there after the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Over the 2014 holiday season, Target offered free shipping on all items.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It recently announced that it was cutting its minimum online purchase to qualify for free shipping in half to $25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And on Wednesday the retailer said it will now allow returns for up to a year for its private and exclusive brands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Target's bounce back from a turbulent stretch including the data breach and exit from Canada has been met with optimism on Wall Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The retailer's stock traded above $80 for the first time Monday, reaching another in a string of all-time highs that it began to log just before the crucial holiday shopping season began in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Earlier this month, Target said it would lay off about 1,700 people, eliminate another 1,400 unfilled positions and cut up to $2 billion in costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It will also focus more on technology to boost online sales growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The latter move will involve about $1 billion aimed at beefing up business from shoppers who are more likely to shop online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Target shares fell 46 cents to close Thursday at $80.60.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Its shares are up 35.5 percent over the past year.</td></tr>
