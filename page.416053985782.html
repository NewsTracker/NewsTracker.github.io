<h3>Bali nine executions: Constitutional Court has no power to alter death sentences</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jakarta: Indonesia's Constitutional Court has no power to alter the death sentences of Bali nine organisers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan or make any ruling on their case, says Indonesian law expert Tim Lindsey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Instead, lawyers for the two men hope Indonesian President Joko Widodo will come under political pressure to reassess their pleas for mercy if the court rules that the constitution requires the president to properly consider clemency submissions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Attorney-General H. M.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prasetyo has accused the men's legal team of "playing with justice" and vowed the Constitutional Court case would not delay the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"If possible it should be done soon so everybody knows we're serious," Mr Prasetyo was quoted as saying by news wire detik.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said the delays had made people question whether Indonesia would proceed with the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I've never been afraid and I'm not under pressure. We will go ahead," Mr Prasetyo added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, Mr Prasetyo conceded the Asian-African conference, which will be held in Jakarta and Bandung from April 19 to 24, could be a consideration when deciding on the date of the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It wouldn't look good if you have many guests and you shoot people, although it is legal," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Among those included in the next round of executions are three Nigerians, a man from Ghana and a Filipina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Asked when the executions would be held, he said: "everything should be good, the weather, the situation and the conditions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran announced on Monday that they would go to the Constitutional Court after the Administrative Court threw out the Bali nine pair's appeal on the grounds that it did not fall within the court's jurisdiction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However Dr Lindsey stressed the latest case was a review of the clemency law itself and in no way an appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dr Lindsey, professor of Asian Law at Melbourne University, said the lawyers would argue the clemency law should be interpreted in a way that would require the president to consider clemency pleas individually, taking into account prisoners' behaviour in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's absolutely established without any question [that] Constitutional Court decisions usually only apply forward in time," Dr Lindsey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It couldn't unravel the decision already made in Chan and Sukumaran's case, but if they succeeded it would create huge political pressure on the president. It might compel the president to go back and read their clemency pleas."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>One of the men's Australian lawyers, Peter Morrissey, said it was true that the Constitutional Court ruling would not "operate as a direct bar to this particular administrative act of shooting two lovely young men".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"But there's, you know, hard power and there's soft power," he told Lateline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"So, it would be a big win for us to win that case and we think the president would respect it, even if he could technically duck it. We don't see him as that sort of bloodthirsty person who would deliberately duck a court ruling."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Bali nine: Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan lose...</td></tr>
