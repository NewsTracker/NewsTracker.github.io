<h3>Apple Music, iTunes and App Store Suffer Outages</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple's Beats 1 station went down during the announcement of nominees for MTV's Video Music Awards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A host of Apple services were knocked out of service intermittently Tuesday morning, including the new Beats 1 radio station that was exclusively announcing the nominees for the MTV Video Music Awards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A support page on Apple's website said all store services were experiencing some kind of disruption beginning shortly before 10 a.m. ET, about the time the Beats 1 Twitter account said the VMA nominations soon would begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Neither Apple nor MTV, a unit of Viacom , mentioned the stumble on their Twitter accounts, which proceeded to tweet the nominees as if nothing was wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The outage is affecting not only Apple's music service, but Apple TV, the iOS and Mac app stores, several iTunes services and more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Not all users were affected, Apple's support page said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It isn't clear how many people in total were unable to use the services, and whether the outage was related to people rushing to Apple services to hear the announcements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It stands to reason more people tuned in to Beats 1 on its launch day, and it's possible that Beats 1 was tripped up because it shares some internal infrastructure with other Apple services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>We have reached out to Apple for comment on Tuesday's outage and will update this post when we hear back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Any time heavily used consumer technology services like Facebook , Apple and Google buckle, users race online to find out if the problem is widespread or "just me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The outages are common enough that Apple and Google, for example, have easily accessible websites tracking when services are interrupted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It's rarer, though, that the outage comes just as the company turns up the spotlight on itself, as with the choreographed MTV partnership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Later Tuesday, Apple is slated to report its earnings report for the fiscal third quarter.</td></tr>
