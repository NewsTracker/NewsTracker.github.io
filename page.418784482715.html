<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The United States will begin training Ukrainian army troops this fall in an expansion of its military involvement in the divided country, the State Department said July 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>U.S. troops have already deployed in small numbers to Ukraine to train National Guard forces, but under the new plan would also take on regular military units.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This will bring the total cost of a security assistance package for the embattled country -- locked in a conflict with pro-Russian separatists -- to $244 million since 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But a spokesman said the training would take place in the west of the country, far from the frontline in the rebellious east, and did not mark a major change in U.S. strategy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This is going to be small unit training...to help strengthen Ukraine's internal defense capabilities," Mark Toner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This training is part of our long-running defense cooperation with Ukraine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Toner said the United States would not be providing new equipment or new weaponry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Our focus is on...non-lethal aid. And there is no plan to change that."</td></tr>
