<h3>Google creating new parent company Alphabet</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>By separating moonshots from moneymakers, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are now free to pursue more quixotic business ideas such as glucose-monitoring contact lenses, Internet-connected, high-altitude balloons and even immortality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Investors cheered the corporate restructuring announced Monday for giving greater visibility into Google's central business and seemed less anxious about zany ventures that may pose as distractions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But of all the businesses in Alphabet - the new holding company that isolates the core search and advertising business from riskier bets - popular smart home accessory maker Nest Labs is likely the only unit that will give investors the returns they crave anytime soon, analysts told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They added that Google's self-driving cars and health ventures, such as storing data on human DNA in the cloud, are potentially profitable, but not for at least several years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"In the near term, investors are going to focus on the core business and give them some leeway," said Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company's shares rose 4% Tuesday in the wake of the announcement and climbed as much as 7% the previous day in after-hours trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Under the structure - search, advertising, maps, YouTube and Android will remain part of Google under the leadership of new chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, currently the company's product chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Search remains the company's financial engine, driving more than 90% of revenue, according to analysts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nest, anti-aging company Calico, smart cities company Sidewalk, secretive lab Google X, as well as Google Capital and Google Ventures - two investing units - will all be run separately with their own leaders, Google said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Through those ventures, Google has tried to accomplish everything from improving public transportation to prolonging the human lifespan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Page and Brin will be Alphabet's CEO and president, respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The company plans to combine the financial results of all ventures outside the core Google business, but investors hope that other firms' results will be broken out as they mature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The prime candidate for such scrutiny is Nest, the maker of smart thermostats, smoke detectors and other security systems that Google bought last year for $3.2 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Although Google has not detailed the company's financial performance, investors have reason to be optimistic, said analyst Avi Greengart of Current Analysis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"There's a tremendous amount of design and engineering," that go into its products, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They are selling (them) at a profit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Nest may benefit from more independence, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The acquisition sparked concerns among consumers that Google would suck up data from Nest's home accessories or put advertising on the gadgets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Now the relationship is "at arm's length again," said Dawson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Analysts are optimistic that some of the other research projects will become profitable businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Google has already begun testing its self-driving cars near its Mountain View, California headquarters as it figures out how to crack a potentially huge market, even as traditional auto makers also pursue the technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It has also recruited top researchers for its health ventures and will have the flexibility to spend years researching and testing products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But the fledgling ventures will also be looked at more closely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>When investors see just how much money the projects are hemorrhaging, they may call for greater discipline, perhaps hampering development, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Heck, Google itself lost money for years before it went public," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Whether ventures thrive or flop, Dawson said, the new structure leaves Google poised for either course of action.</td></tr>
