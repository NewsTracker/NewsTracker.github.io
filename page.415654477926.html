<h3>US urges vigilance after Islamic State online threat</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The United States military has urged "vigilance" after the Islamic State (IS) group allegedly made an online threat against 100 of its service members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The warning came after a group calling itself the Islamic State Hacking Division posted a list of names, addresses and photos of military personnel, and called upon its "brothers residing in America" to kill them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The US Marine Corps said it was visiting all affected staff and urged caution online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Vigilance and force protection considerations remain a priority for commanders and their personnel," US Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel John Caldwell said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It is recommended Marines and family members check their online/social footprint, ensuring privacy settings are adjusted to limit the amount of available personal information."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Pentagon said it was investigating the threat, which remained unverified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The IS Hacking Division said the 100 military staff had targeted the Islamist extremist group in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"With the huge amount of data we have from various different servers and databases, we have decided to leak 100 addresses so that our brothers residing in America can deal with you," the group wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Now we have made it easy for you by giving you addresses, all you need to do is take the final step, so what are you waiting for?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>NATO commander Philip Breedlove called the publication an attempt by IS to divert attention from military setbacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"What we have seen across the last several months is that every time they take a defeat on the battlefield, or every time they are under great pressure on the battlefield, they come out with kind of some big splash like this," he said at a conference in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This caliphate, I think, is under great pressure and so they try to divert attention from what is happening on the battlefield."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The United States is leading an international coalition targeting IS in Iraq and Syria, where the militants have taken over swaths of territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>IS has claimed responsibility for hacking attacks in the US in the past, including against Central Command which oversees the air war against IS.</td></tr>
