<h3>Myanmar police beat students protesting against education bill</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Myanmar student protesters and nationalists clash with riot police during a march in Letpadan town, some 80 miles north of Myanmar's main city, on March 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Myanmar police beat students, monks and journalists with batons and detained about 100 people on Tuesday as they broke up protesters calling for academic freedom who had been locked in a standoff with security forces for more than a week, a Reuters witness said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Yangon is the site of numerous student-led demonstrations, including those in 1988 that sparked a pro-democracy movement that spread throughout the country before being brutally suppressed by the military government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A semi-civilian reformist government took power in 2011 after 49 years of military rule and its response to the current protests has been more muted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The witness saw about 100 protesters locked in two police trucks, while others fled the town and some were chased into a Buddhist temple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Delegation of the European Union, which has been training the police in crowd management, condemned the crackdown, saying in a statement that it "deeply regrets the use of force against peaceful demonstrators."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Interim Myanmar Press Council said it was filing a complaint, protesting "in the strongest terms against the arrest of reporters" and calling for their release, without saying how many journalists were detained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Police and government spokesmen were not available for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Information Ministry posted photos on its Facebook page showing student protesters tearing down police barricades and noted that the protesters removed them "with force."</td></tr>

<h3>Ukraine's military says pro-Russian rebels using truce to amass weapons</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kiev: Ukraine's military says pro-Russian rebels are amassing heavy weapons in depots around separatist-held Donetsk city despite a ceasefire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Attacks have fallen in the past week, but accusations from both sides of violations show the fragility of the peace deal agreed in Minsk last month, which calls for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the frontline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"[Rebels] are continuing to transport equipment and artillery ammunition intensively via the Debaltseve railway junction and build weapons storages around Donetsk," military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said in a televised briefing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A rebel soldier looks in the direction of Ukrainian forces on the outskirts of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which monitors the pull-back of weapons, has said it cannot fully confirm withdrawal on both sides as it has not been given access to all the locations where some weapons have been moved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Lysenko said Ukrainian positions had come under attack from separatists 31 times on Monday, including five instances of artillery fire, and reported nine servicemen had been wounded in the past 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The most troubled areas are Shyrokyne and around Donetsk airport ... yesterday there was fighting almost all day in Shyrokyne," Lysenko said, referring to a village on the outskirts of government-held Mariupol, a strategic port city Kiev fears could be the focus of the next rebel offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chains of ammunition hang in a room dubbed "the sniper's bedroom" at a pro-Russian rebel base on the outskirts of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On the rebel side, officials said Ukrainian forces had violated the ceasefire 17 times in the past 24 hours, but reported no casualties, separatist press service DAN said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said earlier that the ceasefire deal was largely holding, but the army is still sustaining losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sixty-four soldiers have been killed since the peace deal came into effect on February 15, bringing to 1549 the number killed since the war started, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The separatists rarely announce their own casualty figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of providing separatists with troops, training and weaponry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Moscow denies this but has remained under strong diplomatic pressure from European capitals and Washington during the peace deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond on Tuesday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of undermining other former Soviet republics, besides Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We are now faced with a Russian leader bent not on joining the international rules-based system which keeps the peace between nations, but on subverting it," Hammond told the Royal United Services Institute in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"President Putin's actions - illegally annexing Crimea and now using Russian troops to destabilise eastern Ukraine - fundamentally undermine the security of sovereign nations in Eastern Europe," he said as NATO forces prepared for a major exercise in the Baltic states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>US military officials said deployment of about 3000 troops had begun for the three-month Operation Atlantic Resolve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The exercise will see NATO forces working alongside their allies in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The United States also said on Monday it had delivered more than 100 pieces of heavy military equipment to the Baltic states.</td></tr>
