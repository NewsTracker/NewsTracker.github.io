<h3>Apple Gobbles Up Nearly All Smartphone Profits</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple took home nearly 92 percent of all smartphone profits last quarter, according to estimates from Canaccord Genuity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple and Samsung make up more than 100 percent of the smartphone industry's profits because other manufacturers don't make money or they break even, Canaccord Genuity said in a report that came out in May. Microsoft, for example, had a negative 4 percent share of profits in the smartphone market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In all of 2013, Apple captured about 61 percent of smartphone profits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Canaccord Genuity data compares profits from the eight top smartphone makers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The launch of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus last fall helped catapult Apple to market dominance, and the high-end margins for both products helped the tech giant capture the overwhelming majority of smartphone profits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Canaccord Genuity estimates that Samsung is right behind Apple, snagging 15 percent of the profits in the smartphone market last quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Canaccord's estimate were reported earlier Monday by The Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
