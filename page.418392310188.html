<h3>Big Euro teams to avoid small World Cup qualifying groups</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Commercial interests are set to be a factor in the European qualifying groups draw for the 2018 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Teams from Europe's biggest television markets are likely to be guaranteed the most possible matches in six-nation groups, FIFA said Thursday in detailing procedure for the July 25 draw in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>FIFA said that a UEFA proposal asks for England, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain to avoid being drawn into groups containing five teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It would allow popular teams to play the most matches, and increase the value of broadcasting rights which UEFA sells on behalf of member associations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Four years ago, defending champion Spain and 2006 World Cup winner France were both drawn in a five-team group and played only eight matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>France then played two more in the playoff round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>With 52 European teams chasing 13 qualifying places in this World Cup draw, those in the seven six-nation groups will play 10 qualifying matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Teams in the two five-nation groups will play only eight qualifiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nine group winners qualify direct and the eight best runners-up advance to a playoff round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>UEFA said Thursday that it applied the same draw proposal to 2016 European Championship qualifying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Then, the single five-nation group got Portugal as its main attraction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The other eight groups were made up of six teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>FIFA's World Cup organizing committee must approve the proposal one day before the draw in St. Petersburg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The panel should also agree that European seeding will be judged by FIFA ranking alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That would send France and Italy into the second-seeded pot, setting up potential blockbuster groups with top-seeded Germany and Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Romania and Wales entered the top 10 on FIFA's rankings on Thursday after going unbeaten to lead their Euro 2016 qualifying groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Both are likely to be seeded by FIFA despite neither playing at the World Cup since 1998 and 1958, respectively.</td></tr>
