<h3>Airline official: Germanwings probe shouldn't set precedent</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - The head of a trade association representing the global airline industry says the Germanwings air crash investigation shouldn't set a precedent for future crashes because it assigned blame before the probe was complete and could jeopardize future airline cooperation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tony Tyler, director general of the International Air Transport Association, told reporters that global aviation has long-established procedures for investigating crashes that put identifying and correcting safety risks ahead of assigning blame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said investigating with the intent to punish risks a loss of transparency and openness.</td></tr>
