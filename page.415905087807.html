<h3>World must insist on 'better' Iran deal: Netanyahu</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>World powers must toughen their stance to reach a "better" deal with Iran aimed at preventing it from obtaining nuclear weapons, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The concessions offered to Iran in Lausanne would ensure a bad deal that would endanger Israel, the Middle East and the peace of the world," Netanyahu said of ongoing negotiations in Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Now is the time for the international community to insist on a better deal," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One day after an original deadline for a framework deal passed, world powers and Iran continued discussions on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Iran's insistence on keeping underground nuclear facilities, advanced centrifuges and a heavy water reactor" showed its nuclear programme was not solely for peaceful purposes as claimed by Tehran, Netanyahu said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Israeli premier also cited an Iranian general who declared that "Israel's destruction is non-negotiable".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Evidently, giving Iran's murderous regime a clear path to the bomb is negotiable. This is unconscionable," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>To Netanyahu, a "better deal" would "significantly roll back Iran's nuclear infrastructure" as well as "link the eventual lifting of the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program to a change in Iran's behaviour."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Iran must stop its aggression in the region, stop its terrorism throughout the world and stop its threats to annihilate Israel," he added.</td></tr>
