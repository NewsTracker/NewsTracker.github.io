<h3>What It's Like to Get an Apple Watch Fitting</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ABC News' technology editor Alyssa Newcomb tries on an Apple Watch Sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A big day for Apple usually means lines of people, some of who have been camped out for hours or days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>For the release of the Apple Watch, the first new product category since the iPad, Apple is trying something different.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Instead of physically getting in line, Apple wants you to get in line by going online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Beginning at 3:01 a.m. ET today, customers have the option of pre-ordering the Apple Watch of their choice or making an appointment for an in-store fitting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While Apple is directing people to the website to schedule a 15-minute fitting experience, they'll also accommodate walk-ins if time permits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Customers can also play with an Apple Watch display unit that lets them demo the interface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However they won't be able to try one on without meeting with an Apple employee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Logging on to the site at 3:01 a.m. ET was easy -- but it took some patience to wait for an appointment to be booked at Apple's Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan despite the fact that there appeared to be plenty of open spots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Around 3:30 a.m. ET, I got confirmation that I was booked for a fitting at 11 a.m. ET -- meaning I was in the clear to go back to bed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Heading to the store nearly eight hours later, I was met by an Apple employee who checked me and took me over to a display area where she opened a drawer revealing rows of the Apple Watch and the Apple Watch Sport.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>After pulling out the first watch I wanted to try on, the $349 Apple Watch Sport with a white band, my Apple guide helped fasten it onto my wrist and find the right fit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While many of the watches weren't completely charged, some were able to play a demo loop showing the different capabilities of the watch and giving me a feel for what it would look like on my wrist when I'm at the gym or in the office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Next, I tried on the Apple Watch in the Milanese Loop, which provides a more dressy look for the wearable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The magnetic closure made it easy to find the right fit for my wrist.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>Tim Cook has called the Apple Watch the company's "most personal" device yet, and it's an idea that the appointment process really takes into consideration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After spending 15 minutes getting fitted and asking an Apple employee questions, I walked away with a better understanding of the differences between the watches and which one could work best for me.</td></tr>
