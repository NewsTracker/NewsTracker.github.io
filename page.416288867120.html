<h3>Google Handwriting Input will understand your handwriting</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google claims to have cracked a problem that has flummoxed anyone who has tried to read a doctor's note - how to read anyone's handwriting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The firm claims the latest update to its Android handsets can under 82 languages in 20 distinct scripts, and works with both printed and cursive writing input with or without a stylus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It even allows users to simply draw emoji they want to send.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The California search giant claims the latest update to its Android handsets can understand handwriting in 82 languages in 20 distinct scripts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'Entering text on mobile devices is still considered inconvenient by many; touchscreen keyboards, although much improved over the years, require a lot of attention to hit the right buttons,' Google said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'Voice input is an option, but there are situations where it is not feasible, such as in a noisy environment or during a meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Google Handwriting Input is now available on Android phones, and the firm said it took 'many years' to perfect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'Google Handwriting Input is the result of many years of research at Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'Until recently there have been many languages where enabling this functionality presented significant challenges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google also today launched a new feature allowing users who have lost their phone to simply Google it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It works with all Android phones that have the latest Google app installed, and it appears to only work when you're signed into your Google account on Chrome - although this hasn't been confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The same Google account must be signed into on the phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Californian firm announced the tool on its Google+ page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It said: 'We've all been there - you've searched under your car seat, tossed around the sofa cushions and you still can't find your phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'If you know where your computer is you can now ask Google to find your Android phone from your desktop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'If the pesky phone is hiding nearby, Google can ring it for you - or you can see it on the map if you, say, forgot it at the bar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Google's latest tool can't lock the missing phone, or erase its data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Users will need to install the Android Device Manager (ADM) app (pictured) if they want these features.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>To locate a lost phone, sign into a Google account on Chrome via the menu in the top right-hand corner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Type 'find my phone' either into the address bar - if Google is set as the default search engine - or open Google and type it into the search bar on the site's homepage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A map appears as the first search result with a message asking the user to sign in again to confirm their identity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>This prevents people being able to track a person's phone if the previous user forgets to log out of their Google account on a shared Chrome browser, for example.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Google has announced a new tool that locates missing handsets simply by searching for the term 'find my phone' on the search engine's homepage (animated).</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The phone's location is then pinpointed and clicking a 'Ring' button beneath the map will then remotely call the handset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Users will need to install the Android Device Manager (ADM) app if they want these features.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>ADM was launched in August 2013 and works in a similar way to the search tool.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It locates a phone on a map, remotely rings and lets users carry out additional security tasks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Both tools override the selected sound profile, too, meaning that even if a phone is on silent it will still ring at full volume for five minutes, or until it is answered.</td></tr>
