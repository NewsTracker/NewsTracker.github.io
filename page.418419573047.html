<h3>I have a holiday booked in Tunisia â€“ what do I do now?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>British tourists are being airlifted out of Tunisia after it was declare 'too dangerous' - but when will it be safe to go again?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Q What has the Foreign Office done, and what are the implications?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The newly revised travel advice places Tunisia in the same category as Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia - warning against all-but-essential travel parts of the country, and against all travel to the remainder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This gives some indication of the seriousness of the move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It says: "Although we have had good co-operation from the Tunisian government, including putting in place additional security measures, the intelligence and threat picture has developed considerably, reinforcing our view that a further terrorist attack is highly likely."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The new advice obliges travel companies to bring holidaymakers home, and invalidates the travel insurance of anyone who decides to ignore the advice and stay on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Q I have a package holiday booked in Tunisia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>What are my options?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If it is for any time up to 31 October this year, the trip will not be taking place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The strengthened advice actually increases the options for the traveller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Until the Foreign Office warned against travel, holiday companies were offering more than they were legally obliged to do: the possibility of switching to a different destination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They were not, though, offering refunds except for imminent departures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Now, you can choose between a full refund or switching to a different holiday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Q The alternative holidays I have been offered are more expensive than the one I booked in Tunisia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Can the tour operator really make me pay extra?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Compared with some other Mediterranean countries, Tunisia is a budget destination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Therefore it is unsurprising that packages to other locations are more expensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>If you feel the price is too high, then take a refund and make alternative arrangements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>For example, Ryanair has a promotion on flights to Greece over the next few weeks if you want to put together a cheap DIY trip - though be warned that you would forego the protection offered by proper package holidays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Q I still want to visit Tunisia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Can the government stop me going?</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And how could I get there?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>No, the Foreign Office advice carries no legal force - though, as mentioned, it does invalidate standard travel insurance policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>You would be able easily to access the country on Tunisair flights from Heathrow to Tunisia, or from other UK airports via Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Q How long will the Foreign Office "no-go" warning apply?</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>That depends on when the UK government is satisfied that the Tunisian authorities can prevent a repeat of the attacks on tourists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Foreign Office currently says: "We do not believe the mitigation measures in place provide adequate protection for British tourists in Tunisia at the present time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>That could change in days or weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But in order to provide some certainty for customers, tour operators have cancelled their entire summer programmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Jet2 Holidays has gone one stage further, and has axed its 2016 programme to Tunisia as well.</td></tr>
