<h3>Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu given 14 more days to form coalition government</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a visit of Speaker of the US House of Representatives, John Boehner to Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jerusalem: Despite his decisive electoral victory in March, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is struggling to form a government and on Monday was granted an extension to complete negotiations for a new ruling coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Since being tapped to put together the next government, Mr Netanyahu has held talks with the five conservative parties he refers to as his "natural partners."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, a month of negotiations has yet to yield an agreement with any of them to join a ruling coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Netanyahu, who is seeking to form his fourth government since 1996, will have used the 28 days Israeli law allots a candidate for a first stab at securing a ruling coalition later this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Monday, he asked President Reuven Rivlin for the maximum legal extension of another 14 days, taking him to May 7.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuat the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem following his party Likud's victory in Israel's general election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Failure to form a government after that could result in one of his political rivals being asked to try or even result in new elections, though the latter is far less unlikely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Netanyahu is pursuing a government with hawkish, religious and centrist parties that will give him a coalition representing at least 61 members of Israel's 120-seat parliament, or Knesset, though he hopes for the more comfortable backing of 67 lawmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His Likud party won 30 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Negotiations focus on reconciling conflicting demands and ideologies on a wide range of issues such as the settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem; policies on religion and economy; and the division of coveted appointments and the posts' budgets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The deadline pressure on Mr Netanyahu could drive up the political price demanded by each of his potential partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He needs all five for a solid majority of 67 seats that would give his coalition a chance of surviving longer than his recent government, which collapsed after less than two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In theory, the conservative leader still has the option to form a national unity government with opposition leader Isaac Herzog and his dovish Zionist Union party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Such a coalition could provide Israel with a more moderate face to show the international community, but both leaders have strongly rejected it as an unrealistic option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We have made progress and are on the way to forming a government," Mr Netanyahu told Mr Rivlin on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Rivlin urged the prime minister to form a government as soon as possible to restore political stability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The new Knesset elected last month has already been sworn in and Mr Netanyahu's previous cabinet remains in place until it is replaced with a new one approved by the Knesset.</td></tr>
