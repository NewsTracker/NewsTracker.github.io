<h3>French leftists rally in support of Greece ahead of Monday eurozone summit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PARIS - Several thousand leftists have rallied in Paris to "give Greece a chance" two days ahead of a critical summit of eurozone leaders on a bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece's new radical leftist government is in a stand-off with international creditors to reach a loan deal to avoid defaulting on debt payments at the end of the month, threatening an exit from the 19-nation eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Far-left political activist Clementine Autain said that Europe is faced with a "humanitarian emergency" brought on by "neo-liberal political choices" that have failed to reduce Greece's debt.</td></tr>
