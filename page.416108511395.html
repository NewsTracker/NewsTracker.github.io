<h3>UN in $174 mn appeal for Nigeria's Boko Haram refugees</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The United Nations launched an appeal on Thursday for $174 million in what it called "life-saving aid" for almost 200,000 Nigerians who have fled brutal attacks by Boko Haram jihadists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The insurgents, who are seeking to create an Islamic state in the country's predominantly Muslim north, have killed more than 13,000 people since 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Displaced people in north-eastern Nigeria and across borders are in a very dramatic situation," Liz Ahua, west Africa representative for the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said at the launch in Dakar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They continue to fear for their lives, and are at this point unable to return to their homes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some 192,000 people have fled over Nigeria's borders into Cameroon, Chad and Niger seeking refuge from relentless violence, according to the UNHCR.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A further 1.2 million have been displaced within Nigeria as a direct result of the bloodshed, the agency said at the launch of the Nigeria Inter-Agency Regional Refugee Response Plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Staff and volunteers in 23 aid organisations and UN agencies say they are struggling to provide shelter, food, education and sanitation for the refugees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Adequate funding is crucial to make sure aid agencies can improve living conditions for refugees in asylum countries and respond to their protection need," Ahua said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We need to continue to relocate refugees away from the conflict border areas, and establish additional refugee camps where needed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Largely peaceful presidential elections on March 28 saw Goodluck Jonathan lose to challenger Muhammadu Buhari in Nigeria's first ever democratic transfer of power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But security fears remain high ahead of this weekend's regional elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon last month launched an unprecedented joint campaign against Boko Haram after the militants widened their offensive with attacks in the neighbouring countries.</td></tr>
