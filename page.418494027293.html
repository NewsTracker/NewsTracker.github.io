<tr><td>7</td><td>In a brief statement, Iraq's Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, vowed to "take revenge from Daesh criminals on the battlefield... and their cowardly crimes against unarmed civilians will only increase our determination to chase them and to expel them from the land of Iraq."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Islamic State group, also known by the Arabic acronym Daesh, seized large parts of Anbar in early 2014 and captured Ramadi in May. Iraqi forces, which had been making steady progress against the extremists in recent months with the help of the air campaign, scored a major victory in recapturing Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>During the past few weeks, the troops have been moving to cut the militants' supply routes and to surround and isolate Ramadi and Fallujah.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>Hours after the announcement of the military operation, Iraq's Defense Ministry announced the arrival of four F-16 fighter jets from the United States to Balad air base north of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They are part of 36 F-16s purchased by the Iraqi government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The new fighter jets will boost Iraq's Air Force, which depends only on several Russian-made secondhand Sukhoi jets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Last week, a Sukhoi fighter jet accidentally dropped a bomb over a Baghdad neighborhood and killed at least 12 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Meanwhile Monday, the IS group claimed responsibility for Sunday's series of bombings in Shiite areas of the capital, Baghdad, that killed at least 29 people and wounded 81 others, according to the IS-affiliated Aamaq news agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Iraq is going through its worst crisis since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops.</td></tr>
