<h3>HMRC 'fraud' case worrying - judge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Detail has emerged in a written ruling by the judge following the latest in a series of civil court hearings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said HMRC thought that Abbey was involved in the fraudulent evasion of excise duty on "alcoholic goods" on a "very significant scale".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In 2009 it asked for Abbey to be wound up and a provisional liquidator was appointed by a judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Abbey shut down shortly afterwards and one director suffered a mental breakdown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the following year a High Court judge concluded following a trial that there had been "no evasion of duty".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>At the latest hearing - at the High Court in London in November - Abbey asked Mr Justice David Richards to order an inquiry into the damage it had suffered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>HMRC opposed the application - arguing that officials were entitled to advance a case that Abbey had been "knowingly involved in the fraudulent evasion of excise duty".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Justice David Richards said he had decided to order an inquiry into damages suffered by Abbey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This is a worrying case," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It has already cost HMRC some 2.5 million and it seems to me that, if this has not already been done, their position should be considered at a very high level within the HMRC."</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt strikes back at Islamic State militants after beheading video, killing dozens</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO: Egypt said it bombed Islamic State targets inside Libya, a day after the group released a video appearing to show the beheading of 21 Egyptians there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was the first time Egypt confirmed launching air strikes against the group in Libya, suggesting President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is ready to escalate his battle against militants seeking to topple his government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Libya said it had joined and co-ordinated with Egypt on the strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Men purported to be Egyptian Christians held captive by the Islamic State are marched by armed men in this still image from the video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Egypt's military said the dawn strike hit Islamic State camps, training sites and weapons storage areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The strike achieved its targets accurately" and the pilots returned to base safely, the Egyptian military said, as state television ran brief footage of a fighter plane taking off in darkness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A Libyan air force commander said 40 to 50 militants were killed in Monday's airstrikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There are casualties among the individuals, ammunition and the communication centres belonging to them," Saqer al-Joroushi said on Egyptian state television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The number of deaths are not less than 40 or 50 for sure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians, who had gone to Libya in search of jobs, were marched to a beach, forced to kneel and then beheaded, according to the video, broadcast via a website that supports Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In a phone call to Al Arabiya television, Brigadier Saqer al-Joroushi, the commander of the air force loyal to Libya's official government, said more air strikes would be carried out in co-ordination with Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Egypt, the most populous Arab state, has not taken part directly in the US-led air strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria, focusing instead on the increasingly complex insurgency within its own borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The United Arab Emirates, a close ally of President Sisi, said it "would put all its capabilities to support ... Egypt's efforts to eradicate terrorism and the violence against its citizens".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with Sinai Province, a group operating from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Sinai Province has killed hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police since the army toppled Islamist president Mohamed Mursi in 2013 after mass protests against his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Thousands of Egyptians desperate for work have travelled to Libya since an uprising at home in 2011, despite the government's advice not to go to a state sliding into chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A number of Islamist militant groups have been active since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 left Libya without a strong central government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A few have declared ties to the radical Islamic State and claimed high-profile attacks over recent weeks in what appears to be an intensifying campaign.</td></tr>
