<h3>Motherlode Blog: Deployment Is Confusing for Children, Which Makes Children Hard on Parents</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The sentiment perfectly sums up bedtime with our 2&frac12;-year-old: routinely insane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>We've cried it out and cuddled it out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>We've bathed, read and rocked our way into different routines, to no avail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>We've finally settled on "good enough" which consists of a bath, a story, only two trips to the bathroom, bedtime prayers and a hug and a kiss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In my son's defense, I was (and, let's be honest, am still) the same way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The struggle is real.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>I don't like going to bed any more than he does.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Bedtime around here is the time I feel my husband's absence the most.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>We generally tag team dishes and bath, so once the kids are asleep we can enjoy some precious alone time (we also have a 4-year-old daughter).</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With him gone, I keep holding out hope for a fairy godmother to come do the dishes and fold laundry while I handle bedtime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After several snow days last week, getting both of my babies to sleep was particularly stressful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>My little guy would not stay in bed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The sound of those size 9 extra-wide feet running on the wood floor reverberates through the house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I'd already gone through our routine and I'd already been up an extra time to tuck him in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>About the fifth time he got out of bed, I went up the stairs prepared to use my scary mommy voice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I paused about halfway up, took a deep breath, and reminded myself that getting angry at him would not make my night any easier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>I walked into his room, where he was standing on top of his (bolted down) dresser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>I put both hands on my head, and felt myself literally trying to pull my hair out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Another deep breath.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>I gently picked him up, placed him on the floor and knelt beside him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Trying to stifle my exasperation with the only ounce of patience I had left, I asked him, "What is going on?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>His answer took me by surprise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He burst into tears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I miss my daddy," he wailed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>I pulled him close, and despite my best effort, felt my eyes well up also.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I know, bud. I miss him too," I whispered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Back into bed, I snuggled next to him, quietly reminding him just how much his daddy loves him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>His little fingers intertwined with mine, I stayed long after he fell asleep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>As I studied his beautiful face in the silence, I replayed that scene, over and over again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He's not even 3; could he possibly understand those emotions?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Was he "gaming the system"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Did he use my loneliness against me?</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>And did I, by giving in at that moment, guarantee more of the same?</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>I reached out to Dorinda Silver Williams at Zero to Three, the National Center for Infants, Toddlers and Families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Dr. Williams is their director of Military Family Projects, and recently sent me a few picture books to help my children better understand their father's frequent underways, and soon, his nearly yearlong deployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Parenting young children is hard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>There's just no way around it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Our infants and toddlers are not yet equipped with the cognitive or emotional skills to manage the everyday stressors of daily life, let alone handle those more challenging events, such as a separation from a beloved parent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>And so they turn to us, borrowing from our own coping skills, to make sense and meaning out of a situation that they can neither control, nor understand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>If only our youngest children had the language and insight to fully articulate what they were experiencing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"Excuse me, Mommy. I'm a little confused over all of the changes going on around here. I know that you've already got a lot on your plate right now, but if you could just help me to understand the situation and manage my feelings, I'd really appreciate it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>If only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Instead, our youngest children primarily communicate their feelings through their behaviors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>And in times of stress, those behaviors - crying, biting, clinginess, withdrawal, eating or sleeping difficulties, or a return to earlier behaviors - can wreak havoc on the nerves of anyone, let alone a parent who is already feeling physically and emotionally fatigued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>And yet, in the face of this exhausting exchange, something quite extraordinary took place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>For your strength and calm, you were rewarded with a rare response from a 2-year-old, half-drunk on adrenaline and fatigue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>He helped you connect the dots between his external and internal world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>With his proclamation, "I miss Daddy," he was heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>And yet, we all know that's no easy feat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>It's hard to be the calm center amidst the whirling dervish of our toddler's tantrum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>It's hard to give our all to our baby, when we're practically running on fumes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>By taking a reflective pause, just long enough to wonder about the powerful emotions beneath your son's attempt at an all-nighter, you were able to respond with empathy, rather than exasperation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>What a gift to you both.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Who needs a fairy godmother with a response like that?</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Now if she could just teach my toddlers to fold the laundry.</td></tr>
