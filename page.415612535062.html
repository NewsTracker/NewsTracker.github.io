<h3>New Mexico Senate approves two-tiered driver's license bill</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The compromise reached on the issue calls for two distinct driver's licenses - one that complies with federal identification requirements and another that does not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bill sponsored by Sens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Stuart Ingle, R-Portales, and John Arthur Smith, D-Deming, cleared the chamber with a 35-5 vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, with the legislative session wrapping up Saturday, it appears unlikely the House would vote on the measure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The House last month rejected an amendment akin to the long-serving senators' proposal and approved a bill to end the state's practice of giving driver's licenses to people who can't prove they are in the country legally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Senate Public Affairs Committee on Thursday amended that bill to mirror the language in the Ingle-Smith measure but no further action was taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The thorny matter of issuing driver's licenses to people suspected of being in the country illegally has been before the Legislature for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>State officials estimate more than 100,000 licenses have been issued since New Mexico became one of the first states in 2003 to offer licenses to immigrants regardless of status.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Obviously it's controversial, but hopefully we're doing what's best for New Mexico," Smith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ingle called it a tough decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We've got to go forward in some way to get this issue solved," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gov. Susana Martinez, the nation's only Latina governor, has been pushing to repeal the law since she was first elected in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Her office reiterated the governor's opposition to the Senate bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This is a proposal that has already failed the House, isn't Real-ID compliant, and would not require secure IDs in New Mexico," Martinez spokesman Enrique Knell said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Proponents of repealing the 2003 law say polling shows most New Mexicans want to reverse course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They argue that doing so would help prevent fraud and bring the state into compliance with federal identification requirements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sen. Sander Rue, R-Albuquerque, who voted against the two-tiered measure, said supporting the bill would condone illegal behavior.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Those who want to keep the law the way it is argue that a change will hurt working families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They also point to the growing number of states granting driver's licenses in recent years to people regardless of immigration status.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In addition, President Barack Obama's executive actions to allow immigrants to remain in the country have forced some states to allow people covered by his deferred-action program to get licenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ten states now offer licenses to immigrants who can't prove they are in the country legally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The driver's license issue saw heated debate in the House and brought hundreds of protesters to the State Capitol earlier in the session.</td></tr>
