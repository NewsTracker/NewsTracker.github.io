<h3>CIA allegedly sought to hack Apple iPhones from earliest days</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The report cites top-secret U.S. documents that suggest U.S. government researchers had created a version of XCode, Apple's software application development tool, to create surveillance back doors into programs distributed on Apple's App Store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Intercept has in the past published a number of reports from documents released by Snowden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The site's editors include Glenn Greenwald, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his work in reporting on Snowden's revelations, and by Oscar-winning documentary maker Laura Poitras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It said the latest documents, which covered a period from 2006 to 2013, stop short of proving whether U.S. intelligence researchers had succeeded in breaking Apple's encryption coding, which secures user data and communications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Efforts to break into Apple products by government security researchers started as early as 2006, a year before Apple introduced its first iPhone and continued through the launch of the iPad in 2010 and beyond, The Intercept said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Breeching Apple security was part of a top-secret program by the U.S. government, aided by British intelligence researchers, to hack "secure communications products, both foreign and domestic" including Google Android phones, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Silicon Valley technology companies have in recent months sought to restore trust among consumers around the world that their products have not become tools for widespread government surveillance of citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Last September, Apple strengthened encryption methods for data stored on iPhones, saying the changes meant the company no longer had any way to extract customer data on the devices, even if a government ordered it to with a search warrant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Silicon Valley rival Google Inc said shortly afterward that it also planned to increase the use of stronger encryption tools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Both companies said the moves were aimed at protecting the privacy of users of their products and that this was partly a response to wide-scale U.S. government spying on Internet users revealed by Snowden in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An Apple spokesman pointed to public statements by Chief Executive Tim Cook on privacy but declined to comment further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked with any government agency from any country to create a back door in any of our products or services," Cook wrote in a statement on privacy and security published last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have also never allowed access to our servers. And we never will."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron have expressed concern that turning such privacy-enhancing tools into mass market features could prevent governments from tracking militants planning attacks.</td></tr>

<h3>China says Muslim Uighurs have joined Islamic State group</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Authorities in the far-western region of Xinjiang, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan, will strengthen their crackdown on terrorism and extremism as a result, regional representatives said at a discussion on the sidelines of China's legislature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Xinjiang has seen repeated violence as members of the Muslim Uighur minority group have bristled under what they say is repressive Chinese government rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Attacks blamed on Uighurs have also occurred in other parts of the country, including a car that drove into Beijing's Tiananmen Gate in 2013, killing five people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There are Uighurs that have fled overseas and joined Islamic State," said Zhang Chunxian, Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The organization has a huge international influence and Xinjiang can't keep aloof from it and we have already been affected. We have also found that some who fought returned to Xinjiang to participate in terrorist plots."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Beijing has previously blamed the violence on Islamic militants with foreign connections who are seeking an independent state in Xinjiang, but has offered little evidence and ignored calls for independent investigations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Uighur groups say police have used indiscriminate deadly force against people protesting the government's policies in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Global Times, a newspaper affiliated with the ruling Communist Party, said in December that about 300 Chinese are fighting alongside the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Zhang said authorities would take measures to stop people from going abroad to fight with the group, and that he expects "fewer and fewer cases" of that happening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Another official, Shohrat Zakir, said a yearlong crackdown on terrorist activities in the region "has won wide support from people of all ethnic groups."</td></tr>
