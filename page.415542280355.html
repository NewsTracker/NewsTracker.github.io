<h3>DR ABLOW: Inside the mind of Robert Durst - OPINION: Confessions of a creepy killer - Letter, not recording, led authorities to arrest Robert Durst for friend's murder - Police raid home of millionaire Robert Durst</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Durst's arrest follows his participation in an HBO documentary, "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst" that set out to chronicle his life and the mysterious deaths that surround him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>During the shooting of the documentary Mr. Durst was recorded while still wearing a microphone, but not on camera, stating he had "killed them all."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Prosecutors have charged Mr. Durst with murder before, when his neighbor Morris Black was shot to death in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In that case, Durst admitted cutting Mr. Black into pieces and disposing of his body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But he claimed he did that because he was panicked that he would be unfairly judged after killing Black in self-defense while the two were struggling over a gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr. Durst's wife Kathleen vanished in 1982, after allegedly arguing with Durst and after allegedly having told him that she wanted a divorce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She is presumed dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I have neither interviewed nor treated Durst, but as a journalist and psychiatrist, I would argue there are elements of his life that suggest how his mind works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>First, it is known that Mr. Durst left California while authorities were still probing Ms. Berman's killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He donned a wig, assumed an alternate identity as a mute, female botanist and rented a cheap apartment in Galveston, Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Second, it is known that Mr. Durst dismembered Morris Black, put his body parts into trash bags and then threw them into the sea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Third, it is known that Mr. Durst's mother fell to her death when he was 7.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Her death is believed by many to be a suicide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Durst has claimed he witnessed his mother's fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>His brother Douglas disputes that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But even Douglas has been quoted as saying that the scene was something almost beyond imagination-that he and his three siblings were suddenly awakened and whisked out of the house the night the death occurred.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Let's take the last fact, to start with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Just imagine the unconscious mental gymnastics a boy has to attempt in order to function after his mother, young and alive that very day, inhabiting the same dwelling as he, is suddenly dead, perhaps having caused her own death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>When a 7-year-old loses a parent in such awful circumstances, it can shake his belief in the reality of anything and everything-love, friendship, the future, even his own, core identity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And it can make a child bury the loose ends of his grief and rage very deeply.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Was Robert Durst's mother just pretending to be alive and well hours before her death, his 7-year-old mind might have unconsciously wondered?</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Was she pretending to love him, if she then left him?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Were others pretending she was dead?</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>What can be trusted if one's mother can fall off a roof, to her death, while one is warm, tucked into bed, dreaming?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>And what if, even worse, Robert Durst did witness the death-or believes deeply that he did?</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Not everyone can do what Mr. Durst did decades later-disappear from one state, disguised as someone of the opposite gender, pretending to have no voice, living as though impoverished, in a down-and-out apartment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But having to pretend, at 7, to comprehend a mother's alleged suicide, then eventually go to school and play with friends, is a kind of tragic training in disappearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>And only a person who has experience with walling off very powerful feelings-not feeling-could dismember a body as Mr. Durst did, put the remains in trash bags, then cast them adrift.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Could such a person also kill a wife, or kill a friend, or both?</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>What, after all, does having a wife mean to such a person?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>What does having a friend mean to such a person?</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Could it mean something powerful at one moment, then be utterly meaningless the next?</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>If a mother's love can disappear, can't any emotion?</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>If a mother can disappear, can't anyone?</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Maybe the full, human version of Robert Durst, for all intents and purposes, disappeared at age 7, along with his mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Maybe that's why he can assume an alternate identity so completely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Maybe that's why he can cut up a body and throw it away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>And maybe that's why he can tell investigators that his wife-now missing for so long-simply boarded a train all those years ago, never to be seen, again.</td></tr>

<h3>News24.com | Netanyahu claims victory in knife-edge Israel vote</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Figures published by public Channel 1 and private Channel 10 television both gave Netanyahu's Likud and Isaac Herzog's Zionist Union 27 seats each in the 120-member parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A third poll by private Channel 2 gave Likud a one-seat lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Against all odds we achieved a great victory for the Likud. We achieved a great victory for the national camp under the leadership of the Likud. We achieved a great victory for our people of Israel!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu told cheering supporters at campaign headquarters in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Now we have to build a strong and stable government," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Herzog, 54, insisted he was still in the race to form the next government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Everything is open," he told activists in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I intend to make every effort to build a real social government in Israel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The result of the vote is likely to have implications for prospects for new Middle East peace talks and Israel's troubled relations with its US ally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In a late appeal to the far-right ahead of the polls, Netanyahu ruled out the establishment of a Palestinian state if reelected, effectively reneging on his 2009 endorsement of a two-state solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Herzog has repeatedly called for the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Netanyahu made a last-minute call on his supporters to go to the polls to counter a high turnout among Arab Israelis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The rule of the rightwing is in danger. Arab voters are going to the polls in droves!" he said in a video on Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Go to the polling stations! Vote Likud!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The main Arab parties took third place with 13 seats after joining forces to challenge the premier, according to exit polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Likud activists at a temporary headquarters set up in a Tel Aviv convention hall danced in celebration at the late surge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"This is a great victory, almost a miracle," Netanyahu confidant Ofir Akunis told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Now we need to focus on building the new government. We will talk to every party, old and new."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>His Likud had been trailing the Zionist Union by up to four seats in surveys in the week leading up to the vote, which was seen as a referendum on his premiership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Experts said Netanyahu looked like the most likely party leader to be asked by President Reuven Rivlin to form a government after the official results, which are expected in the coming days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Netanyahu has done it. He has managed to catch up in the final lap," said Claude Klein, a specialist in constitutional law at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"On paper, Isaac Herzog has no chance of putting together a majority which would depend on the support of the Arab List which includes openly anti-Zionist MPs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Under Israel's electoral system, the prime minister is not the head of the party that gains the most seats but whoever can build a coalition commanding a majority of at least 61 seats in parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Moshe Kahlon, once a popular minister under Likud, could find himself in the position of kingmaker after exit polls predicted his centre-right Kulanu party won 10 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Kahlon talked to both Netanyahu and Herzog "and told them both he'd make his decision based on the final results," his spokesperson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Israel Democracy Institute president Yohanan Plesner said that although Netanyahu had made a remarkable recovery the outcome was still not certain and in terms of overall voting the centre-left parties were forecast to win 57 seats while the right and religious parties would get around 54.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"In the middle we have Kahlon, who is not committed to either bloc," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I think the clearest political outcome is that he's going to be the kingmaker and it really depends on how he decides to play his cards."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Some 5.8 million people were eligible to vote, with 25 parties vying for the Knesset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Turnout was 71.8%, up from 67.8% in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"Israel has serious problems, and only a rightwing leader can handle them," said a Jerusalem voter who gave his name as Yehoshua, pledging support for Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I'd like to see Netanyahu disappear for many, many years. The most important issue is relations with the Palestinians," said Shulamit Laron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Netanyahu put security at the forefront of his campaign, arguing he is the only one capable of protecting Israel from an Iranian nuclear threat and vowing never to allow the Palestinians to establish a capital in east Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Palestinians vowed to step up their diplomatic campaign for statehood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"It is clear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will form the next government, so we say clearly that we will go to the International Criminal Court in the Hague and we will speed up, pursue and intensify" all diplomatic efforts, chief negotiator Saeb Erakat told AFP.</td></tr>
