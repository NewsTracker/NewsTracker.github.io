<h3>Google e-commerce biz in question as execs flee</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A year ago, Google's commerce initiatives finally seemed to be clicking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Its same-day delivery service, Google Express, was a hit with consumers in San Francisco and its business selling paid product ads in search was, by most accounts, a big success with big retailers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>How quickly things change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In November, Tom Fallows, the architect of Google Express, stunned employees by leaving for a role at Uber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Then, this month, Fallows's well-regarded boss, Sameer Samat, followed him out the door to become president at Jawbone, the health-tracking device maker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Now, Google is set to launch perhaps its most critical commerce-related experiment ever: "Buy" buttons on mobile ads, according to multiple sources, which will turn Google into a cross between a search engine and Amazon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>(The Wall Street Journal first reported the move.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Colin Sebastian, Robert W. Baird and Company, discusses Google's reported plan to introduce "buy buttons" on mobile search results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It's the latest attempt by Google to remake its search business for a world increasingly spent on mobile devices and dominated by apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Amazon-none of which Google owns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The departure of key executives raises questions about Google's long-term commitment to a real commerce battle as Amazon, Pinterest and a coterie of shopping apps eat away at Google's lucrative business related to product searches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The way to tackle it is to either cannibalize yourself or be cannibalized," says Staples e-commerce lead Faisal Masud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>For many of its early years, Google was happy with the role it played in online shopping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Online shoppers searching for items on Google often clicked on search ads related to those products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It was a good business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But as Amazon became the dominant player in U.S. e-commerce over the last few years, Google has suffered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Every time someone goes straight to Amazon's website or app to buy something, Google loses a potential product-search query and the ad revenue that comes with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>To help combat this, Google in 2013 launched what is now called Google Express-a shopping service and website where shoppers can order clothing, household items and packaged groceries from local retail stores for delivery that day or the next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The service is available in seven major cities, including San Francisco, New York, Chicago and parts of Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Customers pay $10 a month or $95 a year for the service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>According to a report in the Wall Street Journal Google will roll out a "buy" button on some search results, making it easier to purchase directly from the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Express project positioned Google as a technologically advanced ally to retailers in their uphill fight against Amazon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But Fallows's sudden departure for Uber stunned his team and the commerce group at Google on the whole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Tom was Google Shopping Express," a former Google employee said, referring to the same-day delivery service by its original name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"He built it. It was the Tom show."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>People close to Fallows maintain that he did not lose faith in the Shopping Express project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Instead, he was long an admirer of Uber and its mission and viewed the role at Uber as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Nonetheless, his departure raised a red flag among some partner retailers and employees, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In the wake of Fallows's exit, some Google executives feared his team would follow him out the door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>That fear was largely unrealized, but a new predicament arose when Samat, his boss, chose to leave for Jawbone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Samat, who has been with Google for more than seven years, was well respected internally and known for getting things done, people who have worked with him said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He was also an executive who presented well in front of retail executives and was generally liked in that industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In addition to Shopping Express, Samat also oversaw Google's travel-related search engine projects and its Product Listing Ads business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>PLAs are promoted search results that mimic a standard shopping site page, even including product photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Scot Wingo, executive chairman of e-commerce software company ChannelAdvisor, estimates that PLAs now account for $5 billion to $8 billion in annual revenue for Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The product is at the center of the European Union antitrust probe into Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Google buy button?</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>According to the WSJ, Google will launch buy buttons on its search engine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Jon Steinberg, The Daily Mail North America CEO, weighs in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>But Google is not shelving the business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Instead, it's putting the shopping ads at the center of a mobile makeover, and when its new purchasing button arrives, it will only appear within PLAs, sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Partnering retailers can pick which products they want to advertise with a buy button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>By clicking on these shopping-enabled ads, shoppers will be directed to a Google webpage for purchasing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Initially, the buying capability will only work with ads displayed on mobile phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>A nagging issue for online retailers paying for PLAs is conversion-getting someone who clicked on a product image to complete the purchase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Google is positioning the experiment as a way to help retailers fix that by reducing the number of steps between viewing the ad and completing an order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>It arrives shortly after Google introduced a series of ad enhancements inside mobile search in a bid to claim more of the transactions and ad dollars that have gravitated to rivals like Amazon and Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"Why are people getting off of Google product search?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Masud, the Staples executive, asked rhetorically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"It must be for a reason; the reason is it must not have the best experience. This should be better in many ways."</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Masud declined to comment on the buy button initiative related to Staples specifically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Google's new buy button will have limitations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>For one, shoppers may only be able to purchase one type of product at time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>This would make it more of a promotional tool than a real Amazon competitor, according to Jason Goldberg, vice president of commerce strategy at digital ad agency Razorfish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>What's more, online retailers that sell modestly-priced products don't love single-item orders, since shipping fees eat deeper into their margins than if multiple products are being shipped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>"I don't think anyone knows if this will work, but I don't think Google is going to stop if this first experiment fails," one source familiar with the project said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>"Google has to get this right on mobile."</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Google also seems intent on getting Google Express right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Multiple people say Google's leadership team is still supporting the initiative, but it's not clear how long that commitment will last.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Re/code previously reported that the company was earmarking as much as $500 million for the project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Google introduced an Amazon Prime-like subscription business for Google Express in the fall, but it's too early to tell whether that model will do well enough to make the delivery business self-sustainable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>In addition to Amazon, Shopping Express faces competition from several venture-backed delivery startups, including Instacart and Deliv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>"I'm pleased with how Google Express has been growing recently, from new cities to a popular pricing model to the addition of new merchants," Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's SVP of ads and commerce, said in an emailed statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>"And we're lucky to have a deep bench of leaders in our Shopping and Commerce teams who are doing a great job driving our products forward."</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Jonathan Alferness, a VP and veteran of Google's mobile ad businesses, will soon step into Samat's role, according to a person familiar with the decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Shopping Express is now being run by Victoria Ransom, an entrepreneur who joined Google in 2012 when the company acquired her social-marketing business Wildfire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>"Google executive leadership at the top really loves the product and really, really wants it to be successful," one source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>"But the jury's still out on if it will be."</td></tr>
