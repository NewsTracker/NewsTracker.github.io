<tr><td>5</td><td>The mother of three of Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s children sued the undefeated boxing champion for defamation over his recent comments about her and a 2010 domestic violence attack in Las Vegas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Josie Harris filed the lawsuit Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, days after her ex-boyfriend defeated Manny Pacquiao in a highly anticipated bout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mayweather's attorney Shane Emerick said he hasn't been served the case and declined to comment Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The lawsuit focuses on comments Mayweather made during an April interview with Yahoo News anchor Katie Couric in which he said he was restraining his ex-girlfriend and that she was on drugs at the time of the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The lawsuit calls Mayweather's comments "utterly false."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mayweather was arrested and charged with domestic violence after a hair-pulling, arm-twisting attack on Harris in September 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Two of their children witnessed the attack, which Harris' lawsuit states occurred because the boxer was jealous of her relationship with another man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In 2012, Mayweather served two months in jail after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The boxer told Couric, "Did I restrain a woman that was on drugs? Yes I did. So if they say that it's domestic violence, then you know what, I'm guilty of restraining a person."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The statements by Mayweather during the Couric interview were totally and unequivocally false and defamatory," Harris' lawsuit states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The true facts are Harris was not a drug-abuser or drug-addict."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Harris, who according to the suit is seeking to become a television personality, is seeking $20 million, although a jury would have to decide any actual damages award.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The boxer was sued last year by his ex-fiancee, Shantel Jackson, who claims Mayweather beat her during their relationship and later publicly humiliated her by posting on social media a sonogram of her pregnancy and saying they broke up because she got an abortion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mayweather is seeking to dismiss Jackson's lawsuit and a hearing on his motion is set for June 8.</td></tr>
