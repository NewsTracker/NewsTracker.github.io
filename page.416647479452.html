<h3>Moments of Joy in Nepal as 2 Are Rescued 5 Days After Quake</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Nepalese woman protects her child from rain as she waits for transport to go to her home town, in Kathmandu, Nepal, Thursday, April 30, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 7.8-magnitude earthquake shook Nepal's capital and the densely populated Kathmandu valley on Saturday devastating the region and leaving tens of thousands shell-shocked and sleeping in streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 15-year-old boy had been buried alive for five days, listening to bulldozers clearing mountains of debris, fearful the incessant aftershocks might collapse the darkened crevice he was trapped in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And then, "all of the sudden I saw light," Pempa Tamang said, recounting the moment Thursday he was pulled from a hole at the bottom of what was once a seven-story building in Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tamang did not know whether he was alive or dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I thought I was hallucinating," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The improbable rescue was an uplifting moment in Nepal, which has been overwhelmed by death and destruction since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Early Friday, the government said the toll from the tremor, the most powerful recorded here since 1934, had risen to 6,198 dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After night fell, police reported another dramatic rescue: A woman in her 20s, Krishna Devi Khadka, was pulled from a building in the same neighborhood as Tamang near Kathmandu's main bus terminal, according to an officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Life has become a struggle to survive. It gives us hope," Hans Raj Joshi said after watching Tamang's rescue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We thought they were only bringing out the dead. It's hard to believe people are still alive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>When Tamang was finally extricated, rescue workers inserted an IV in his arm, propped him onto a yellow plastic stretcher - the same kind that has helped convey countless dead - and carried him through the ruins on their shoulders as if he was a newly crowned king.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Lines of police stood on both sides, keeping back mobs of bystanders and journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A dazed Tamang, wearing a dark shirt with the New York Yankees logo and the words "New York Authentic," blinked at the bright sky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>When the procession turned a corner and entered the main road outside, there came a sound Kathmandu hadn't heard in days: the jubilant cheers of thousands of ecstatic onlookers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nepal, however, is far from normal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>More than 70 aftershocks have been recorded in the Himalayan region by Indian scientists in the past five days, according to J.L. Gautam, the director of seismology at the Indian Meteorological Department in New Delhi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Anxiety over the aftershocks and worries over the fate of relatives have caused many to leave the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Thousands have boarded buses provided by the government to their rural hometowns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I have to get home. It has already been so many days," said Shanti Kumari, with her 7-year-old daughter, who was desperate to see family in her home village in eastern Nepal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Although small shops have begun reopening, and the once ubiquitous tent cities have begun thinning out, an air of desperation remains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We're still feeling aftershocks. It still doesn't feel safe," said Prabhu Dutta, a 27-year-old banker from Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Some residents have begun returning to work, including at Dutta's bank, but he said it was impossible to concentrate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We roam around the office. We only have one topic of conversation: the earthquake."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Tamang recounted his story to a group of reporters inside a tent at an Israeli field hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He looked weak and tired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>His dark hair was disheveled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But otherwise he seemed fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>When Saturday's quake began at 11:56 a.m., Tamang said he was having lunch with a friend in the hotel where he worked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>As he ran down toward the way out, the stairs shook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He saw walls cracking, ceilings caving in.</td></tr>
