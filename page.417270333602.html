<h3>Venus Williams ousted from French Open by Sloane Stephens (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PARIS (AP) -- A loss by Venus Williams in the first round at a Grand Slam is no longer the rarity it once was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And, as it happens, the woman who beat Williams at the French Open on Tuesday, Sloane Stephens, is making a concerted effort, at her coach's behest, to focus less on who is on the other side of the net.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Still, it was hard not to see the 22-year-old Stephens' 7-6 (5), 6-1 dismissal of seven-time major champion Williams, who at 34 was the oldest woman in the field, as a statement about the directions their respective careers are heading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>For the 15th-seeded Williams, it was her second opening defeat in three years at Roland Garros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It also was the fifth time in the last 13 Grand Slam tournaments she's entered that she exited in the first round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Before that stretch, it happened once in 37 majors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Williams didn't show up for a news conference, meaning she could face a fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 40th-ranked Stephens, who has reached the French Open's fourth round the last three years, was consistently strong from the baseline, making only 14 unforced errors to Williams' 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''I want her to play with a sense of joy ... and play everything as well as she can, relentlessly, and not be concerned with the result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Let the result take care of itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And she did a good job of that today,'' said Stephens' coach, Nick Saviano.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''I have noticed that missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>... For any athlete, in any sport, at any high level, they must have that passion and the joy to perform,'' Saviano explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''Otherwise, it becomes onerous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The biggest victory of Stephens' career came at the 2013 Australian Open, when she defeated Williams' younger sister Serena en route to the semifinals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This was the first time Stephens had faced Venus Williams, other than beating her in an exhibition as a teen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Now Stephens joins Lindsay Davenport as the only Americans to have beaten each Williams at a Grand Slam tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Two other seeded women lost Monday: No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>14 Agnieszka Radwanska, who was the runner-up at Wimbledon in 2012, and No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>22 Barbora Strycova.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Two seeded men exited, too, including No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>11 Feliciano Lopez, who now has 10 first-round exits in 15 appearances in Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Winners included No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>3 Andy Murray, who played with his wedding ring tied to his shoe and improved to 11-0 since getting married, and defending women's champion Maria Sharapova.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>She was jeered off Court Philippe Chatrier for skipping the customary post-match interview, citing a cold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Stephens was reserved during her on-court interview, referring to Williams as ''someone we all looked up to for so long,'' but hardly celebrating as if this meant a lot to her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''I think she's pleased.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But she wants to perform well every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>She doesn't want to make a big deal out of one match,'' Saviano said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Stephens - whose late father, John Stephens, was the 1988 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year with the New England Patriots, and whose mother, Sybil Smith, was Boston University's first All-American in women's swimming - was composed throughout the match, finding the spots for her deep groundstrokes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Holding a break point in the second set's second game, Stephens was preparing to receive a serve when the ball hit by Williams startled a pigeon, which flapped its wings and took off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Stephens, in turn, was startled and released quite a shriek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Instead of an ace, the point was replayed, and Williams flubbed a shot to get broken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>''It was a very dramatic moment, I would say,'' Stephens said with a smile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>''First of all, I didn't know what it was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>I thought it was way closer to me than it actually was.</td></tr>
