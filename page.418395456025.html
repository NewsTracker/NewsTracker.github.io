<h3>Is Facebook Planning To Launch Its Own Music Streaming Service?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Is Facebook Planning To Launch Its Own Music Streaming Service?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Rumors are circulating that Facebook reportedly has plans to enter the already saturated music streaming market, but a report from The Verge says that this is not the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The rumors come on the heels of the Apple Apple Music launch and amid a concerted effort by the social media giant to push video content on its platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Music Ally, a music industry site, reported that Facebook is in early talks with music labels about initially streaming music videos on the platform and about its plans to eventually launch a full fledged music streaming service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The outlet reported that the music video roll out on Facebook is expected in the coming months and that the company will pay royalties to artists and copyright holders-similar to YouTube's Content ID system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's a mass land grab. Facebook going into the video space was always going to be an enormous, ambitious land grab and no doubt something they've been planning for some time as the potential income from ad revenue will be incredible," a source reportedly told Music Ally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Music Ally added that the latter part of Facebook's plan-the music streaming service that will bring it into the ranks of Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal-isn't expected until after the company irons out the kinks in its video monetization scheme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Verge, however, reported that a source close to Facebook said that "the last thing Facebook wants to do right now is take on Apple in a streaming war."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Verge's sources did not deny that the social media giant was in the early stages of talks with music labels, but stressed that if it does introduce a music product it will be something new and unique.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The reports that Facebook might be introducing music videos to the platform has yet to be confirmed by the company, but Forbes has reached out for comment.</td></tr>
