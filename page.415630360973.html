<h3>Top GOP rep questions claim Secret Service taped over footage</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The chairman of the House oversight committee, in an interview with FoxNews.com, on Friday sharply challenged claims by the Secret Service that key surveillance footage - which may have shown two agents in an embarrassing incident earlier this month - was simply taped over as a matter of agency policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It's highly suspicious," Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I have a hard time believing that's true."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Chaffetz remained skeptical, even after Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy on Thursday tried to clear the air over Secret Service videotape practices at a Senate committee hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In question is footage that may have shown two allegedly inebriated agents driving into a White House suspicious package scene, after returning from a party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Lawmakers have been shown two tapes so far - but they were surprised to learn that footage from other fixed positions around the White House grounds may be lost, because of an apparent Secret Service practice of taping over most footage after 72 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Pressed at Thursday's hearing, Clancy confirmed the practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He said while he wasn't in the service when it was first implemented, it is done for "privacy" reasons - since surveillance cameras capture images of visitors all around the White House complex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, Clancy acknowledged, in hindsight, that giving White House surveillance footage just a 72-hour shelf-life is "too short of a time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We've got to go back and look at the standards of the other agencies and do a good best-practices look at this. But there's no question we've got to hold these tapes longer," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He pledged that a "workgroup" would examine the policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Chaffetz, who plans to hold a Secret Service hearing on Tuesday, isn't waiting for the workgroup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He said "even 7/11" keeps footage and he's formally asking the Secret Service to try and dig up more than just the two tapes they've provided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It doesn't pass the basic common-sense test," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They provided the two tapes - where are the rest?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Clancy said Thursday he's instructed his staff to reach out to the manufacturer to try and recreate the tapes that were supposedly scrubbed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We're doing everything we can to retrieve those images," he told senators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A Secret Service spokesman said the reason two videos were not taped over is they were deemed pertinent to the original package investigation (the package turned out to be a book).</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Chaffetz, though, noted that the agency should want to be able to "piece together parts of the puzzle maybe months apart from each other."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Chaffetz said his committee would start interviewing rank-and-file members as part of its own review of the March 4 incident, where the agents in question reportedly were allowed to go home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Chaffetz, who could not speak in detail about the two videos he's seen, said one of them is "clearly worthless."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The other, he said, is "very close" and provides a good angle of the agents' vehicle driving by the suspicious package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But he said footage from additional cameras could provide important context - making clear how wide the perimeter was, how the agents got through and whether they were stumbling or driving erratically in the process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"There's a lot to be learned by these tapes," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>While all the recent attention from the incident has been on the two agents who drove into the scene, Chaffetz also voiced concerns about the suspicious package investigation itself, and how the suspect was initially allowed to drive off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Separately, Chaffetz questioned the response time of the Metropolitan Police Department, and on Thursday sent a letter to their police chief seeking additional details of their involvement.</td></tr>

<h3>Georgians hit by fallout from trouble in Russia, Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 64-year-old woman spends much of her meager pension of 150 lari ($68) a month on medicine and has long lived off selling cheap jewelry at a flea market to tourists, mainly from Russia and Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Now, the number of visitors is shrinking due to the economic crisis in those countries and people like her in this former Soviet republic are feeling the pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"There were some signs of life in January, when suddenly some tourists from Russia, Ukraine and Poland appeared, but since then it's been a complete catastrophe," said Matiashvili.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some days she makes five lari from tourists, sometimes only one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Georgia, a mountainous nation in the South Caucasus, relies heavily on wine exports and on tourists attracted to the mountains and beaches that for decades made the country a favored holiday destination for the Soviet elites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While tourists might ordinarily be enticed as Georgia's currency sinks, making travel cheaper, many of those who visit Georgia come from countries facing their own economic problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Georgia's currency, the lari, has lost more than 20 percent of its value against the dollar since August - but Ukraine's hryvnia currency has lost about 60 percent against the dollar and the Russian ruble roughly 50 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Due to the economic tensions, tens of thousands took part in an opposition-led protest Saturday in the capital, Tbilisi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The demonstration was peaceful, despite the bitter political divide between the government team formed by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream party and supporters of former President Mikhail Saakashvili, whose party has been in opposition since losing the 2012 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Those at the protest spoke bitterly of their dashed economic hopes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"In the last elections, I voted for Georgian Dream; their promises were very pretty. But now it's become clear that they've fulfilled almost nothing," said demonstrator Tina Khomeriki, a 35-year-old teacher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The government, led by Ivanishvili ally Irakli Garibashvili, insists the crisis has been talked up by political opponents and sensationalist media and is not the result of policy failings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I think that really an artificial hysteria has been created, especially by the media," Prime Minister Garibashvili said last month in a notably pugnacious response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We have to calm, normalize and stabilize the situation. I want to say that we're doing everything to correct the situation as quickly as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>While it has been 24 years since Georgia voted for independence from the Soviet Union, the country retains close business links to Russia and Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As the war in eastern Ukraine, international sanctions against Russia and the sinking price of oil price worldwide have ravaged the economies of those two countries, Georgia has become collateral damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>While the falling lari has made many imports more expensive, it has fallen by less than the Russian ruble over the last year, making exports to that key market more difficult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>One affected industry is Georgian wine, long renowned in neighboring countries, and which has started to attract the attention of European and American connoisseurs in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Despite producers branching out, Russia and Ukraine remain the top two wine export markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In January and February this year, exports to Russia were down 85 percent and those to Ukraine fell by two-thirds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Paata Sheshelidze, director of the Institute of Economic Freedom, said the economic difficulties have been made worse by government policies, including regulations and taxes that he said have restricted development of the private sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The weakening of Georgia's currency, he said, was largely due to an increase in the money supply to cover budget expenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The currency turbulence has also had a devastating effect on those Georgians who took out foreign-currency loans in search of lower interest rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Igor Khuchua mortgaged his apartment to fund a bakery, but now, at 66, he faces being made homeless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Despite getting help from the bank to restructure his debt, Khuchua sees no way out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I've basically lost my apartment. I took out a loan on it to open my business, but the lari's fall has had a negative effect," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I can't blame anyone. I took the risk myself, but the situation's objectively worsened with the fall of the national currency."</td></tr>
