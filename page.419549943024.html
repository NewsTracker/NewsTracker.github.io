<h3>'No justice' over Bali Nine bribe claims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Indonesia's Judicial Commission has failed in its duty to investigate claims of corruption in the sentencing to death of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, their lawyer says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Todung Mulya Lubis on Monday night gave a lecture to Melbourne University Law School, as the Judicial Commission decided to drop its inquiry into the claims, which were raised in the days before the mens' April executions for drug trafficking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The pair's original trial lawyer, Mohammad Rifan, sensationally alleged they could have got a lighter sentence if they had paid a bribe - but that this offer from a judge was later withdrawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The commission had already been asked to investigate but it didn't seek evidence from Mr Rifan or the other Bali lawyer for the men at the time, Australian Peter Johnson, until after Sukumaran and Chan were sent to the firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prof Lubis recalled the episode emotionally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It is difficult to determine the truth of this statement but it is the duty of the Judicial Commission to investigate," he said of Mr Rifan's claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Regretfully the investigations did not take place before Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were executed. Justice was not served."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Judicial commissioner Imam Anshori Saleh on Monday confirmed the matter was dropped because there was not enough information on the record from Mr Rifan or Mr Johnson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Rifan gave a statement but he didn't want to record it in the dossier," he told AAP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Peter was summoned twice and he never showed up and he was phoned many times, but he was not answering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"With this, the Judicial Commission feels that there's not enough evidence to proceed."</td></tr>
