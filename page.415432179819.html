<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>I don't have grown-up children in real life.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>Elizabeth Hurley is a conniving queen in 'The Royals.'(Photo: Brian Bowen Smith, E!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>NEW YORK - Elizabeth Hurley's manipulative and malicious Helena, the pretend British queen on E!'sThe Royals (Sunday, 10 p.m. ET/PT), makes Mad Men's icy Betty Draper seem sweetly affectionate by comparison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I'm just so nasty to her," says Hurley of her scenes with her wild-child daughter, Princess Eleanor (Alexandra Park), who opens the series by having her nether regions splashed all over the tabloids, much to her mum's rage and shame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hurley's getting quite the kick out of parenting her unruly TV brood, which also includes the well-meaning, if callow, Prince Liam (William Moseley).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He becomes the sudden heir to the throne after his older brother, Robert, dies in an accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This is the first time as an actress I've ever had grown-up children, in anything. I don't have grown-up children in real life. I'm enjoying it," says the actress, the mom of Damian, 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hurley lives in England and, like so many, is obsessed by her country's telegenic young couple, Prince William and his pregnant bride, Duchess Kate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And no, she doesn't have any special insights into their private lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I know as much as anybody knows who reads Hello! magazine. I see what they show us: not very much at all. We see everything they want us to see," she says.</td></tr>

<h3>NZ should prepare as Cyclone Pam deepens</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Communications were knocked out in much of the region by Cyclone Pam, a maximum category five storm, and aid agencies said it could be several hours before a clear picture emerged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The UN office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs said on Saturday it was checking an unconfirmed report of 44 dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>People spent the night in makeshift shelters, the Red Cross Pacific regional head Aurelia Balpe said, as Pam, packing winds of more than 250 kilometres per hour, slammed into the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The storm crossed the main Vanuatu island where more than 65,000 people live and a group of islands further south which are home to 33,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which has been monitoring the storm, said most parts of Vanuatu had been affected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The storm reportedly changed course at the last minute, hitting the capital Port Vila harder than expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's really bad out there. The wind is howling with a deep roar that just doesn't let up. Anyone not in shelter now is in mortal danger," the administrator of the Humans of Vanuatu Facebook page wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The news reports that a communications tower on Ambrym island has fallen down. There seem to have been fatalities, but of course it's impossible to confirm just now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Power was out in much of Vanuatu and communications were cut, although aid agency Save the Children said Pam "is feared to have caused widespread damage" and it was preparing to mount a humanitarian response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Red Cross was also assessing what was required in terms of food, medicine and shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Vanuatu Meteorological Service has forecast "very destructive" hurricane-force winds, torrential rain and flash flooding for most of Saturday.</td></tr>
