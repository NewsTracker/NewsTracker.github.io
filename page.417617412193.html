<h3>Greek negotiators in Brussels to explore deal possibility</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cranes operate at the construction site of the Stavros Niarchos Culture Center where the new opera house and national library will be completed in 2016, in southern Athens, on Monday, June 8, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 566-million euro project is one of the country's few privately funded projects since the country was struck by a major financial crisis in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greek negotiators are in Brussels to explore the "scope for convergence" with the country's creditors, following days of acrimony over rival reform proposals for a deal that will unlock Greece's last remaining bailout funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greek bailout negotiators sought Monday to narrow their differences with international creditors following days of acrimony over rival reform proposals for a deal to unlock Greece's remaining rescue funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis said negotiators were in Brussels to explore the "scope for convergence" with creditors and indicated there was room for negotiation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He also sought to douse talk of elections, saying it was not something the government was considering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some ministers had raised the issue as an option if a deal cannot be reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Talks between Greece and its creditors have been deadlocked since late last week, when Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras rejected as unacceptable a proposal made by the three institutions overseeing his country's bailout - the European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and European Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that time was running out, and that while Greece's partners want the country to remain in the eurozone, Athens has to do its part by implementing reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It has to be said, there's not a lot of time, that's the problem, that's why we have to work as intensively as possible," Merkel said at the end of a G-7 summit in Elmau, Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Everyone at the table wants Greece to stay in the eurozone," said Merkel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"But as I said ... we have rules."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>President Barak Obama also weighed into the dispute from the G-7 meeting, saying the Greek government must undertake economic reforms, but also that the international community must recognize "the extraordinary challenges" Greece faces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A solution is needed by June 30, when Greece's bailout program ends and the remaining 7.2 billion euros ($8.1 billion) in rescue loans will no longer be available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Without the funds, Greece cannot repay its debts and could end up crashing out of Europe's joint currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Sakellaridis reiterated that Greece considers its proposal - a 47-page document delivered by Tsipras during a visit to Brussels last week - to be the basis for a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The Greek negotiating team that has gone to Brussels is evidently there so as to see the scope for convergence so there can be a mutually acceptable solution to both sides," Sakellaridis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The two sides disagree on a number of issues, such as pension cuts and labor reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Each side has said it is expecting a response to its own proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Worries of a Greek default and euro exit kept European stock markets in check Monday with the Stoxx 50 index trading 0.8 percent lower and the Athens Stock Exchange closing down 2.7 percent after starting the morning up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank said the "room for manoeuver looks limited" for both sides, noting that hardliners within Tsipras' radical left party and the government's nationalist coalition partner "may oppose almost any condition which lenders must attach to the disbursement of money."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And on the lenders' side, he said "the IMF and - to a lesser extent - the ECB seem to be against any further concessions to Greece."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>However, he estimated, "after some further huffing and puffing, Tsipras will have to either accept the deal on offer with just minor face-saving modifications or risk crashing Greece out of the euro."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Schmieding put the chances of the latter at 30 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Jitters over Greece swelled when the government delayed a payment due last Friday to the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Instead, it opted to bundle all four IMF repayments due this month into one on June 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Allowed under IMF rules, the option has been used only once, by Zambia in the 1980s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Tsipras on Friday described the institutions' proposals as an "unpleasant surprise," saying they ignored progress in negotiations over the past few months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The rejection sparked the ire of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who is considered more lenient towards Greece than the IMF, ECB and Germany, which is the largest single eurozone contributor to Greece's bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"We will continue to work for a solution," Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"There is a position of the three institutions which is a good basis for finding a solution, provided that all sides concentrate on the remaining issues to be solved."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>If no deal can be found, one possibility would be for the current bailout to be extended again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Originally due to end late last year, it has already been extended twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But Sakellaridis said this was not something the government was aiming for, and reiterated that Greece wants a comprehensive solution that will also tackle the debt issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Athens argues its debt, currently at more than 170 percent of economic output, is unsustainable and that some form of debt relief is needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The current stalemate comes after five months of difficult negotiations since Tsipras won January elections on promises to repeal austerity measures creditors imposed in return for two bailouts worth a total of 240 billion euros ($270 billion.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, in Berlin to deliver a speech, met with his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble for talks that the Greek minister described as "productive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"We have a common understanding of the problem," Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>A man walks past a shop window in Athens, Greece, on Sunday, June 7, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Greece cannot accept the "irrational" proposal made this week by its bailout creditors, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told an emergency Parliament session Friday, adding that any deal must also include some lightening of the country's crushing debt load.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>A worker takes a break at the construction site of the Stavros Niarchos Culture Center where the new opera house and national library will be completed in 2016, in southern Athens, on Monday, June 8, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The Finance Minister of Greece, Yanis Varoufakis, right, leaves the German finance ministry after a meeting with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble in Berlin, Germany, Monday, June 8, 2015.</td></tr>
