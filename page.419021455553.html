<h3>Greek stocks plummet as market reopens</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's main stock index plunged more than 16 per cent on Monday as it reopened after a five-week closure, giving investors their first opportunity since late June to react to the country's latest economic crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Athens Stock Exchange and Greek banks were closed on June 29, when the government imposed controls on money withdrawals and transfers to keep a run on bank deposits from causing the financial system to collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Banks have since reopened, while maintaining strict cash withdrawal limits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece is expected to head back into recession in 2015 - after briefly emerging from a six-year contraction - due to the effects of capital controls and months of uncertainty over the country's future in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Two surveys published Monday illustrate the extent of the damage wreaked on the Greek economy in July by the bank closures, money controls and general uncertainty over the country's future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Financial information company Markit said its gauge of manufacturing activity in Greece plummeted during the month to 30.2 points, its lowest ever reading, despite improvements across the rest of the 19-country eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Manufacturing output collapsed in July as the debt crisis came to a head," Markit economist Phil Smith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Factories faced a record drop in new orders and were often unable to acquire the inputs they needed, particularly from abroad, as bank closures and capital restrictions badly hampered normal business activity."</td></tr>
