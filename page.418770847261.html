<h3>Greek talks to begin after 'technical' issues ironed out</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece - High-level talks between Greece and its European creditors on a third bailout for the cash-strapped country have been delayed until logistical matters are sorted out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greek government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili sought to downplay talk that security concerns are a reason why European negotiators won't now arrive in Athens until Saturday at the earliest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They had been expected Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The delay, she said, is related to "technical issues" and that the security of negotiators isn't one of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A European official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations, said final preparations regarding the structure of the talks were being ironed out but that discussions at a technical level were taking place between Greece and representatives from the country's creditors.</td></tr>
