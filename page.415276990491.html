<tr><td>5</td><td>(AP) - A 19-year-old black man died Friday night after being shot by an officer in Madison, authorities said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>Authorities have not released the 19-year-old's name, but family members identified him to local media as Tony Robinson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The officer's name and race has not been released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The state Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation is investigating the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A crowd of people gathered at the scene Friday night and chanted "Black Lives Matter," the Wisconsin State Journal reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Andrea Irwin, who told WKOW that she was Robinson's mother, said: "My son has never been a violent person. And to die in such a violent, violent way, it baffles me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Koval said police were called about 6:30 p.m. Friday because the man was jumping into traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A second call to police said the man was "responsible for a battery," Koval said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The officer went to an apartment where he thought the man had gone, and forced his way inside after hearing a disturbance.</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>"I expect there will be a lot of anger and frustrations, particularly from friends," Soglin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I hope as the pain eases that something constructive will come of this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Koval mentioned recent officer-involved shootings across the nation, saying "it's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting. ... We would urge, obviously, that everyone exercise restraint, calm and allow the Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) to conduct their affairs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Sharon Irwin, who told the newspaper she was Robinson's grandmother, urged protesters to be peaceful.</td></tr>
