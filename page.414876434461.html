<h3>Germany rejects Greek olive branch on eve of bailout talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Germany quickly rejected a conciliatory bailout proposal by Greece on Thursday, dampening hopes that emergency talks might break a deadlock threatening the country with default and an exit from the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Greek government asked to extend its rescue loan agreement by six months, in order to give all sides more time to hash out a more permanent deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That goes much of the way toward satisfying an ultimatum from the 19-country eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It held back, however, on offering to continue in full a series of budget cuts and reforms that the eurozone has required since 2010 in exchange for loans, but that Greece blames for devastating its economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Germany was quick to say the plan was not good enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>German finance ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger said it "is not a substantial proposal for a solution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said it amounts to a request "for bridge financing without fulfilling the demands of the (bailout) program," namely the budget measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It does not, he added, correspond to what the eurozone countries had demanded of Greece before talks broke down on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The European executive Commission was somewhat more upbeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Spokesman Margaritis Schinas said Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker "sees in this letter a positive sign which, in his assessment, could pave the way for a reasonable compromise in the interest of financial stability in the euro area as a whole."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said Juncker held talks with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tspiras and Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who will head Friday's emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>-an easing in the repayment terms on Greece's existing 240 billion euros in bailout loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That would be based on an old offer by the eurozone to extend repayment dates and lower interest rates once Greece achieves a budget surplus - that is, excluding the cost of debt interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Greece has achieved such a surplus.</td></tr>
