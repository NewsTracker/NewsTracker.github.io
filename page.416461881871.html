<h3>Latest on Boston bombing trial: Prosecution rests its case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Federal prosecutors have rested their case in the penalty phase of the federal trial of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (joh-HAHR' tsahr-NEYE'-ehv).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The prosecution rested Thursday afternoon after calling a man who lost a leg in the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They will get a chance for rebuttal after the defense presents its case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The defense is expected to begin presenting its witnesses Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tsarnaev was convicted earlier this month of all 30 charges against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Three people were killed and more than 260 others were wounded when twin bombs exploded at the 2013 marathon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A jury must decide whether to sentence him to life in prison or to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A trauma surgeon has testified at the Boston Marathon bomber's trial that an 8-year-old boy gravely injured in the blasts didn't die instantly and suffered visceral pain before he bled to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Dr. David King is a military combat surgeon who testified Thursday during the penalty phase of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's (joh-HAHR' tsahr-NEYE'-ehvz) trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>King says Martin Richard's liver, spleen and intestines were twisted and stretched by the blast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He says Martin was particularly vulnerable to injury from a bomb placed on the ground because his vital organs were closer to the blast than they would have been if he were an adult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Prosecutors have argued that the boy's vulnerability is one of the aggravating factors that make Tsarnaev's crimes deserving of the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Martin's family wasn't in court Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Prosecutors have asked a survivor of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings to identify for jurors the photos of all the victims who had to have at least one leg amputated after the attacks - 17 people in all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Heather Abbott, of Newport, Rhode Island, took the stand Thursday during the penalty phase of the federal trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (joh-HAHR' tsahr-NEYE'-ehv).</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She says she was catapulted through the entrance of a restaurant when the second bomb exploded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She says her left foot felt like it was on fire, so she began crawling to follow a crowd trying to get away from the bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Abbott says later, in the hospital, she had to make the difficult decision to have her leg amputated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She identified for jurors the photos of victims wearing prosthetics and in wheelchairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A man who lost a leg in the 2013 Boston Marathon attacks has wheeled himself to the witness stand, staring intently at the bomber sitting at the defense table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Marc Fucarile (FOO'-kuh-rihl) was the first person to testify Thursday for the prosecution in the penalty phase of the federal trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (joh-HAHR' tsahr-NEYE'-ehv).</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Fucarile says one of the first things he remembers after the second bomb went off is lying on the ground looking up at the sky and a nurse saying, "He's still on fire."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Fucarile's right left was blown off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He says his left leg was severely injured, and it's still unclear whether he will have to have it amputated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Three people died and more than 260 others were injured in the bombings.</td></tr>
