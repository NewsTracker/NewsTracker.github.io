<h3>Mayweather announces Sept. 12 fight with Andre Berto (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mayweather announces Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FILE - In this May 2, 2015, file photo, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., celebrates his unanimous decision victory over Manny Pacquiao, from the Philippines, after their welterweight title fight in Las Vegas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mayweather Jr. will return to the ring for the first time since boxing's richest fight ever, facing Andre Berto on Sept.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Floyd Mayweather Jr. will return to the ring for the first time since boxing's richest fight ever, facing Andre Berto on Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>12 in what he has said will be his final fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The welterweight title bout doesn't figure to be nearly as lucrative as Mayweather's May 2 fight with Manny Pacquiao that earned him a reported $220 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But it will still be sold on pay-per-view, even though Mayweather will be an overwhelming favorite to win for the 49th time in as many fights as a pro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Berto, a 2004 Olympian, was once thought of as a rising star but has lost three of his last six fights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Two of those losses were to Robert Guerrero and Victor Ortiz, fighters that Mayweather beat easily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''I always bring my A-game and this fight against Andre Berto is no exception,'' Mayweather said in announcing the bout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''He's a young, strong fighter who is hungry to take down the best.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The fight is the last in a six-bout deal that Mayweather has with the Showtime network, and the boxer has said repeatedly he will retire when the deal is finished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The 38-year-old retired once before, but came back to fight after taking a short break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''Floyd has been completely consistent and hasn't wavered a bit in saying this is his last fight,'' said Stephen Espinoza, executive vice president and general manager for Showtime Sports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Espinoza dismissed criticism that the fight looks like a mismatch, saying there were complications trying to do a deal with Britain's Amir Khan and not a big pool of other fighters to choose from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said Berto will be aggressive against Mayweather, something Pacquiao was not able or willing to be in their fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''He's one of those fighters who never fails to entertain,'' Espinoza said about Berto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mayweather waited until the last possible moment to announce the fight, which will take place at the MGM Grand arena where he won a unanimous decision over Pacquiao.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mayweather and Berto will get together in Los Angeles on Thursday to promote the bout, which is less than six weeks away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Berto (30-3) won his first 27 fights as a pro after losing in the first round of the Athens Olympics, winning a piece of the welterweight title along the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But he was then beaten by Ortiz and would go on to lose back-to-back fights to Guerrero and Jesus Soto Karass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Berto, who has rebounded to win his last two fights, said he will prove his worth in his biggest bout ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''Best believe that I plan to bring it to Floyd and I'm not concerned about what 48 other fighters have been unable to do,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>If Mayweather beats Berto he would improve to 49-0, matching the perfect record set by Rocky Marciano before he retired as heavyweight champion in 1956.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>There has been speculation Mayweather would fight at least once more to break the record, perhaps opening the MGM's new arena on the Las Vegas Strip next spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Espinoza declined to say what he thought the Berto fight would sell on pay-per-view, coming on the heels of the record-setting 4.4 million buys of the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It will, however, be cheaper, with a suggested price of $74.95 compared to $99.95 for Pacquiao.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Espinoza said Mayweather has done nearly 10 million PPV buys in his first five fights on the Showtime contract.</td></tr>
