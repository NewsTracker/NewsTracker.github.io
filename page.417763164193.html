<h3>Blatter may seek to stay as FIFA boss, source tells Swiss paper</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GENEVA (Reuters) - Sepp Blatter may seek to stay on as the president of FIFA, a Swiss newspaper reported on Sunday, less than two weeks after Blatter said he would step down over a major corruption scandal at the organisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, Domenico Scala, the official overseeing the process of choosing a new president, said that Blatter's departure was an "indispensable" part of planned reforms to football's governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blatter is under pressure to step down for good as U.S. and Swiss authorities widened their investigations into bribery and corruption at the sport's global governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>EU lawmakers are among those calling for his immediate departure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But according to the Schweiz am Sonntag newspaper, Blatter had received messages of support from African and Asian football associations, asking him to rethink his decision to step down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Blatter was honoured by the support and had not ruled out remaining in office, the newspaper said, citing an anonymous source close to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Blatter said on June 2 he would step down as FIFA president in the wake of the corruption investigation, having led football's world governing body since 1998,, although he would stay on until a successor was elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>FIFA, in an emailed statement, referred Reuters to the speech Blatter made on June 2 and said they had "no further comment to make".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In his speech, Blatter said: "I have decided to lay down my mandate at an extraordinary elective Congress. I will continue to exercise my functions as FIFA President until that election."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He also added: "Since I shall not be a candidate, and am therefore now free from the constraints that elections inevitably impose, I shall be able to focus on driving far-reaching, fundamental reforms that transcend our previous efforts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But Scala, head of FIFA's audit and compliance committee, said in a statement that Blatter needed to stick by his pledge that he would not stand again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"For me, the reforms are the central topic," he said, without referring to the interview directly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"That is why I think it is clearly indispensable to follow through with the initiated process of president's change as has been announced. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Blatter has changed his mind in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>FIFA is expected to pick his replacement at an extraordinary congress in Zurich between December and February..</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The exact date will be decided by an executive committee meeting on July 20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Blatter's renewed interest in the job was also a reason for the departure of Walter de Gregorio as FIFA's director of communications, since he had argued for a completely new start and advised Blatter to go, the Swiss newspaper said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>De Gregorio declined to comment to the newspaper.</td></tr>
