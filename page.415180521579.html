<h3>Chile volcano sends spectacular pillar of fire into night sky (VIDEO)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Some 3,385 people have been moved from communities surrounding the volcano, according to the mayor of Pucon, a nearby town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Interior Minister Rodrigo Penailillo said there were no reports of any injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But although the fireworks display from the volcano was breathtaking, a major lava flow isn't expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Intermittent gas and steam continue to be erupted, although the situation remains volatile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"After an eruptive pulse, which was pretty intense but very short at 3 am (0600 GMT), the volcanic system remains unstable and it is possible that something similar could occur again in the next few hours," the head of national geological service Sernageomin said on Tuesday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There is no danger to aviation in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Juan Carlos Rojas, head of air transit at the government's civil aeronautics division, said that ash from the volcano was well under flight paths used by commercial airliners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>After an emergency meeting on Tuesday morning, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said she would travel to the affected area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The volcano is quiet now, very calm. You wouldn't know anything had happened,"he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Villarrica volcano is about 750 kilometers south of the capital, Santiago, near the popular resort town of Pucon in the so-called Pacific Rim of Fire, the second largest chain of volcanoes (after Indonesia) in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Chile has 2,000 volcanoes in the Andes, of which 90 remain active.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The last major eruption of Villarrica was in 1985, and more than 100 people are thought to have died in mudflows on it slopes throughout the 20th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>When it erupted in 2011, the neighboring Puyehue volcano sent a huge cloud of ash into the atmosphere disrupting flights for months in neighboring Argentina.</td></tr>

<h3>Toronto pastor missing in North Korea: church</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Reverend Hyeon Soo Lim travelled to North Korea on Jan. 31 as part of a regular humanitarian mission where he supports a nursing home, a nursery and an orphanage, said Lisa Pak, a spokeswoman for the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Toronto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pak said his family and church have not heard from him since.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The trip was about helping people and not political, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lim, 60, has made over 100 trips to North Korea and has always previously been in regular contact his family and church, Pak said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He was scheduled to leave Feb. 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Pak said they are not sure why they haven't heard from him, but noted North Korea just lifted severe restrictions on foreign travel imposed last year to keep the Ebola virus from crossing its borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The already isolated country virtually closed its borders to foreigners last October, halting all non-essential visas and requiring those few foreigners allowed in to undergo three weeks of quarantine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Even with the Ebola quarantine timing the delay is a little bit longer than expected," Pak said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Hopefully, best case scenario we hear from him in a couple days."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Pak said Lim, who is married with an adult child, expanded the church from just five families to 3,000 parishioners today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Toronto City Councilor Raymond Cho, who has known Lim for over 20 years, is concerned the North Korean regime may have detained him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The church is under real stress," said Cho, who said Lim is a great preacher who has raised money for poor North Koreans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If he's detained, if North Korea keeps him for whatever reason, it really doesn't look good for North Korea."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Cho said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"A lot of people know that Reverend Lim has helped North Korea, especially poor people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nicolas Doire, a spokesman for Canada's foreign affairs department, said consular officials are in contact with family members and providing assistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Doire said there is no Canadian office in North Korea and the "ability of Canadian officials to provide consular assistance is extremely limited."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>South Korean soldiers patrol along a barbed-wire fence near the demilitarized zone with North Korea, on Monday, March 2, 2015.</td></tr>
