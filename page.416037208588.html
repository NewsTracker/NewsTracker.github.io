<h3>Czech PM criticises country's president after U.S. diplomatic spat</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>European Union leaders are boycotting the ceremony over what they say is Russia's role in the conflict in Ukraine but Zeman - who has frequently departed from the EU line and criticised sanctions against Moscow - has said he would attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka made clear his view that it was crucial for the security of the former Soviet-bloc nation to remain in lock step with NATO and the EU.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I would of course welcome if Mr. President's approach to foreign policy and diplomacy in general was somewhat more professional," news agency CTK quoted Sobotka as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Czech presidency is largely a ceremonial role but Zeman - who was the first president directly elected when he took office in 2013 - has frequently drawn the ire of government leaders for his public comments on domestic and foreign affairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sobotka said Zeman reacted disproportionately to the U.S. envoy's comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Schapiro had told Czech television it would be "awkward" if Zeman attended the ceremony as the only statesmen from an EU country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He later said he had no intention of telling a foreign statesman where to travel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I understand the desire to honour all who sacrificed in World War Two, but I think it would be unfortunate for President Zeman to be there as perhaps the only EU head of state, watching a military parade, at a time when Russian troops are destabilising a neighbour in violation of international law," Schapiro said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I regret that President Zeman was offended by that; as someone who claims to value blunt talk, I would have expected him to appreciate my candour."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Zeman, a former prime minister, has frequently departed from the common EU line on Ukraine and has criticised sanctions against Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The government, which is responsible for foreign policy, however, has held the EU line fully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Moscow has backed the rebels in eastern Ukraine but denies Western accusations that it provides them with money, arms and troops.</td></tr>
