<h3>Detroit resident finally feels at home next to wacky public art project</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Artist Tyree Guyton started it nearly 30 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Otila Bell settles into a chair on the front porch of her house, swaddled in coats, sweaters and blankets to ward off the bitter chill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A box of felt-tip markers sits on a table beside her, and steam rises temptingly from a large thermos filled with hot chocolate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The icy street is silent on this Saturday afternoon, but not for long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Hey, you wanna sign my house?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bell hollers as a young couple meander into view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's only $1!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The pair look at each other uncertainly and move on, but Bell's high, girlish voice carries, and within minutes her porch is filled with people waiting to hand over $1 and autograph one of Detroit's most unusual urban salvation ventures: Bell's yellow house, whose steps, front porch, columns and part of the roof have been rehabbed using signers' dollars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There are signatures from Papua New Guinea, Ukraine, Germany and Brazil, with messages scrawled in a variety of languages and colors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Anthony Bourdain's above the front door may be the most famous on the house, but it is not the most exotic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>To understand how Bell, 62, got into this, you have to look at the houses and yards surrounding her property on Heidelberg Street, in a desolate area east of downtown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nearly 30 years ago, an artist named Tyree Guyton, who grew up on the street, began transforming the decaying residential area into what he considered an art project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Empty lots sprouted sculptures made of castoff toys, broken dolls and old appliances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Vacant houses were painted in multihued, whimsical designs, and giant polka dots appeared on the pavement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Fences were adorned with old shoes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Bell's house was in the midst of this cornucopia of color, and she was not happy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"To me it was junk," said Bell, whose house has been in her family for more than 40 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She was particularly dismayed to see crosses planted in a vacant lot where homes had once stood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But she softened over the years as it became clear that the Heidelberg Project was bringing some joy to this sliver of the vast, economically withering city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In July 2012, after prodding from relatives, Bell decided that the best - actually the only - method for raising money to repair her 124-year-old home's exterior was to take advantage of the Heidelberg Project's popularity by inviting passers-by to autograph her house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Bell's change of heart was a coup for the project, which from its beginnings has faced resistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The city bulldozed it twice in the 1990s amid complaints it was an eyesore and nuisance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Since May 2013, fires blamed on arsonists have destroyed several of the project's houses, leaving charred remnants of what used to be cheerful urban canvases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Heidelberg Project has since erected surveillance cameras and floodlights, improving security on the street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Winning new fans can only help the nonprofit organization, which offers arts programs for neighborhood children and sells works by local artists from a tiny gift shop next to the house where Guyton grew up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The project gives people hope. It's not so gloomy here," said Stacy Risner, the Heidelberg Project's community coordinator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>When the daytime temperature is above 25 degrees, Risner works weekends at the gift store, and she makes a point of telling visitors to walk up the street to Bell's house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Bell, she notes, used to be one of the project's loudest critics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Bell even was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey in 1991 for a show on so-called public nuisances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Now she's one of our biggest fans," Risner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Bell shares her Victorian home with her son, Melvin, and daughter, Tajauana, who on this day had taped clear plastic along the side of the porch to shield her mother from the wind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The plastic rippled in the breeze, but Bell showed no sign of being cold as she eyed the street below, like royalty keeping watch on her subjects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Most days, if weather permits, Bell spends time on the porch, and Saturday and Sunday afternoons are her busiest period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Cars slowly purr down the street, their occupants snapping pictures and sometimes parking and getting out for a closer look at the Heidelberg Project creations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Bell's porch looks out on a lot dotted with the kinds of things she once disdained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Stuffed animals are piled high into a colorful boat, which seems in danger of capsizing as a giraffe prepares to board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Spider-Man and a couple of baby dolls, one without a head, occupy a bench facing the street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Wooden slabs painted as clock faces, each showing a different time, are scattered across the landscape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>On the far end of the lot sits the frame of a house, covered in vinyl record albums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>To the left of Bell's house is the one where Guyton once lived, its white wood covered in cheerful - some might say gaudy - polka dots in a rainbow of colors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The tree growing outside that house is topped with a couple of shopping carts, and its trunk is covered with toys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Bell's house looks normal, until you look closer and see the signatures on the porch ceiling, the columns and every exterior wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Some are faded from years of exposure to rain, snow and blazing sun, but their traces are visible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Julien Guye, on a business trip from Paris, handed his dollar to Bell, picked out a purple marker and walked to the side of the house to scrawl a brief message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"It's a fun way to help someone who needs it," Guye said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Bell's hope is to raise enough money to paint her house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>That would cover up the signatures, but it doesn't worry Bell, who has no idea how long it will take before she can paint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Money raised so far has gone toward rehab work that needs to be done first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>One thing is certain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Bell is not sold on the idea that stuffed animals stuck on trees or wildly painted houses are art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>When she paints her house, it will be yellow with brown trim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>But Bell has grown to appreciate the effect of her fanciful surroundings, which draw visitors year-round to a neighborhood once headed for blight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>"It looks nice now. It looks real nice," Bell said approvingly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>"We have one of the nicest places around."</td></tr>

<h3>Tunisia terror: Nine arrested as Islamic State 'claim responsibility' for museum attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An audio statement posted online today says the group is responsible for the attack on Wednesday at the Bardo National Museum where 20 tourists died - including British solicitor and mother-of-two Sally Adey, 58, of Shropshire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Islamic State said in the statement Abu Zakariya al-Tunisi and Abu Anas al-Tunisi carried out the attack which also left more than 40 people injured, including 13 Italians, seven French, four Japanese, two South Africans, one Pole, one Russian and six Tunisians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Express cannot verify the authenticity of the audio statement but current US thinking is the attack may have been carried out by local "franchise" adherents to ISIS, rather than directed centrally by the group's leadership now thought to be in Syria, according to CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Today nine people have been arrested in connection with the attack - five in direct connection to Wednesday's attack and the other four arrested in central Tunisia are allegedly part of a cell supporting those involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A security source said two family members of one of the gunmen, who was killed by security forces during the attack, have been arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Earlier today Tunisia's Prime Minister Habib Essid told French radio station RTL the two suspects were Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Laabidi was known to Tunisian intelligence services, the country's prime minister confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We arrested the father and the sister of the terrorist Hatem Al-Khashnaoui in the their home in Sbiba City", a security source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He declined to give details about how they were involved in the attack, but said an investigation is underway in Tunis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Shropshire woman Sally Adey, 58, was gunned down by Kalishnikov-wielding attackers who killed 19 other tourists and two Tunisians - including a policeman - at the Bardo National Museum in the country's capital, Tunis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Today neighbours and colleagues are in shock as they told how the British woman killed in the attack, Sally Adey, of Caynton, near Beckbery in Shropshire, had been "really looking forward" to the cruise she was on with husband Rob, 52, when she was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He was unharmed and is receiving support from the UK embassy in Tunis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The couple were passengers on the MSC Splendido cruise ship which arrived in Tunis the morning of the terror attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Julia Holden, a partner at Midlands law firm where Mrs Adey and her husband worked, and a close family friend, issued a statement on behalf of the family, including the couple's two children Harry, 23 and university student Molly, 20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She said: "Sally Adey was a much-loved daughter, wife and mother. The family are devastated by her loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They are also saddened for others who have lost people they love, and for those who have been hurt."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Prime Minister David Cameron also paid tribute to Mrs Adey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He said: "Our heart goes out to her family. We will do everything we can to help the family at this very difficult time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said the attack was "the latest example of extremist terror" and added: "We have to fight it with everything we have, whether that is taking the poison out of young minds here in Britain, whether it's working with intelligence, policing and security services in other countries around the world or whether it's dealing decisively with those areas of the world from which these problems come."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Cameron pledged: "In the end, our values - freedom of speech, democracy, the rule of law - they will win through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We must show the persistence and consistency to make sure they do but I'm confident they will."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He said terrorists and extremists "hate democracy".</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mr Cameron said: "We mustn't let democracy, freedom, the rule of law, the things we hold dear and the people of Tunisia hold dear, we must not let them be defeated or undermined by these extremists and terrorists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"That is the battle we are engaged in but I'm confident if we stick to our values we will win through. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Bardo Museum remained ringed by razor wire today as security forces guarded the main roads in Tunis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Speaking in the aftermath of the tragic event, President Beji Caid Essebsi declared that he will not give up in the battle against terrorism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"These monstrous minorities do not frighten us," the President said on national TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We will resist them until the deepest end without mercy. Democracy will win and it will survive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>British tour operators confirmed that while thousands of customers are believed to be in the country, "very few" were in the capital where the attack was carried out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The European Union's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini blamed the Islamic State terror group for the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The driver of a tourist coach said: "They just started opening fire on the tourists as they were getting out of the buses - I couldn't see anything except blood and the dead."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Television footage showed dozens of people, including elderly foreigners and one man carrying a child, running for shelter in the compound next to the parliament, covered by security forces aiming rifles into the air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The attack on such a high-profile target is a blow for the small North African country that relies heavily on European tourism and has avoided major militant violence since its 2011 uprising to oust autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Several Islamist militant groups have emerged in Tunisia since the uprising and authorities estimate about 3,000 Tunisians have also joined fighters in Iraq and Syria - raising fears they could return and mount attacks at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>It followed a string of attempted strikes against the Tunisian authorities, who broke up four alleged terror cells as recently as Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Last month 32 militant Islamists linked to IS were arrested across the North African country, which is where the Arab Spring started in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>However, the attack on such a high profile target is a huge blow for the small North African country that relies heavily on European tourism and has so far avoided major militant violence since its 2011 uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>As the Tunisian economy has collapsed, many radicals have either fled to join IS, or else formed terror cells in their own country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>British Foreign Office travel advice for Tunisia currently reads: "There is a heightened security presence in the centre of the city of Tunis. You should be especially vigilant at this time and follow the advice of Tunisian security authorities and your tour operator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"There is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners."</td></tr>
