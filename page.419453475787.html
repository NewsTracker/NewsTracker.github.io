<tr><td>2</td><td>(Reuters) - Smartphone sales in China, the world's biggest market for the devices, fell in the second quarter for the first time, market research firm Gartner Inc said on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sales of smartphones in China declined 4 percent in the quarter, the first year-over-year fall, the company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"China has reached saturation - its phone market is essentially driven by replacement, with fewer first-time buyers," said Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The country accounted for about 30 percent of total smartphones sales during the second quarter, according to the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gartner also said worldwide smartphone sales grew at the slowest pace since 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Still, Apple Inc's share of the worldwide smartphone sales market rose to 14.6 percent from 12.2 percent a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Total iPhone sales in China soared 68 percent to 11.9 million units, Gartner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple's big-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which shattered iPhone sales records when they were launched, are about 11 months old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's share of the global smartphone market fell to 21.9 percent from 26.2 percent, Gartner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Despite the new S6 models, which it released in April, Samsung's premium phones continued to be challenged by Apple's large-screen iPhones, the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, [HWT.UL], the fourth-largest smartphone maker globally, recorded the highest sales growth rate of 46.3 percent due to strong international sales and 4G smartphone sales in China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Apple's shares were down about 2 percent in early trading on the Nasdaq.</td></tr>
