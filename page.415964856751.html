<h3>Martinez picks Republican for New Mexico Senate vacancy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Martinez picked former Estancia Mayor Ted Barela to fill the remainder of Griego's term, which expires in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I have great confidence that Ted will work hard to represent the residents of District 39 well and believe he's committed to working with legislators from both parties to diversify our economy and improve our schools," Martinez said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The six counties that make up the district forwarded the names of nominees to the governor last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The list included Santa Fe County Commissioner Liz Stefanics, former San Miguel County Commissioner Hugh Ley and former Santa Fe County Commissioner Jose Varela Lopez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Three counties nominated Stefanics, a Democrat, as their pick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Martinez had called for the counties to hold emergency meetings soon after Griego's resignation so she could fill the vacancy before the end of the legislative session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She argued that important decisions were being made in the session's final stretch and District 39 had no representation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Some of the counties balked at the suggestion, saying they needed more time and that the decision would affect the district beyond the session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The dispute resulted in a two lawsuits - one calling for the selection process to be speeded up and the other seeking to force the governor to wait until all counties submitted nominations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Griego, D-San Jose, held the seat for more than 18 years but submitted his resignation last month because of an ethics issue that stemmed from his role in the sale of a state-owned building in Santa Fe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Griego said his resignation was necessary "to avoid a major distraction to the important work that needs to be accomplished for the families and children throughout the state of New Mexico."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Barela, a resident of Torrance County, works as a project manager for a large engineering firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He served as Estancia mayor from 2008 until 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>With Barela's selection, Democrats will lose one seat in the Senate but maintain the majority, 24-18.</td></tr>
