<h3>Amir returns to domestic cricket after 4 1/2 years of ban</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Amir had opening batsman Naved Malik and Ali Sarfraz caught off successive deliveries in his fourth over of a grade-two match, one level below first-class cricket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He missed the hat trick when he bowled down the legside to No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>4 batsman Mohammad Irfan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He still took three wickets in his first six-over spell at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, conceding 23 runs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, his second spell was ineffective as the left-armer was smashed for 31 runs in three overs without success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In all, Amir took 3-73 off 16 overs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I always try to make batsmen play as much as possible," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I am trying to give 100 percent, but to be honest with you, it's not easy after all these years. It's like starting from zero."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Amir was banned from all cricket after pleading guilty in 2010 to charges of bowling deliberate no-balls at pre-arranged times to fix spot betting markets, while playing for Pakistan in a test against England at Lord's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The International Cricket Council shortened his five-year ban in January, for his cooperation with its anti-corruption and security unit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 22-year-old Amir made a delayed return when his match last Tuesday was washed out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He's playing for Omar Associates in the three-day Patron's Trophy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Four and a half years ago I was at my peak, and I can't get back those years," Amir said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But as a Muslim, I believe there's always a lesson in life. I can't rewind those years but I should avail what time I have ahead of me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He has at least two more three-day matches in the tournament, then plans to play in a domestic T20 tournament next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I delivered 90 percent of my deliveries where I wanted to. The inswingers which were there in 2009 are still coming up nicely," he added with a broad smile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Amir has received a mixed response about his international future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Former Pakistan board chairman Tauqir Zia and ex-captain Ramiz Raja say he shouldn't represent Pakistan again because he's tainted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But Amir seems to be unruffled by the critics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He has set his sights on making Pakistan's series against India in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Who doesn't want to play against India?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Amir said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It's a dream of every Pakistani cricketer to play against India, and my aim is to give performances, stay fit, and get selected."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He was considered Pakistan's next great bowler, having taken 51 wickets in 14 tests at an average of 29.09, and 25 wickets in 15 one-day internationals at an average of 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He also had 23 wickets in 18 Twenty20s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Sabih Azhar, the coach of Rawalpindi Rams, for whom Amir will play in the T20 tournament next month, supported Amir's return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"He certainly deserves one more chance," Azhar told The Associated Press after watching Amir from the boundary line at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"He's ready for international cricket, and his body language clearly tells you that he's hungry to do well for Pakistan."</td></tr>
