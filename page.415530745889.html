<h3>Russian MPs refuse to hold minute's silence for murdered Nemtsov</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Opposition lawmaker Dmitry Gudkov proposed that the lower house of the Duma hold a minute's silence at its first full session since the brazen assassination of one of President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics sent shockwaves around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 55-year-old former deputy prime minister, who was gunned down on a bridge opposite the Kremlin on February 27, was himself a lawmaker from 1999 to 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Despite the fact that not everyone shared his political views, I think it would be the right thing to do on a human level to honour his memory with a minute of silence," Gudkov said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky objected: "Someone dies every week. Should the Duma stand up every time?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Speaker Sergei Naryshkin threw out the proposal, saying he had sent a telegram to Nemtsov's family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"For the record: the State Duma refused to announce a minute of silence over Nemtsov's murder. Only I and Valery Zubov stood up, no one else," Gudkov wrote on Twitter, referring to another member of his party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The parliament's upper house, the Federation Council, held a minute's silence for Nemtsov on March 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Investigators have revealed few details of the probe into Nemtsov's murder since detaining five suspects earlier this month who are accused of carrying out a contract hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The prime suspect in the killing, former Chechen police officer Zaur Dadayev, initially confessed to the crime but later told a member of the Kremlin's rights council he had been tortured into doing so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The allegations sparked a fierce reaction from Russia's powerful Investigative Committee which accused the council of meddling in its probe and threatened to investigate its motives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Investigators then refused a request by the head of the rights body to visit the suspects last Friday in the wake of the torture allegations, saying they were looking into the charge "in accordance with the law."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the president was being kept up to date on the investigation.</td></tr>

<h3>Audi withdraws all polo sponsorship leaving International Day in limbo</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The news has left the Hurlingham Polo Association to find new sponsors for the England team, as well as International Day this summer, the flagship day for English polo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The HPA had been in talks for the past two months to seek continuance of the three-tiered sponsorship but it has not gone ahead, leaving the sport's national governing body in a period of "review", according to its head administrator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>New sponsors for the England team and International Day will be sought as soon as possible, but Test Matches and the International Day event are not under threat, according to David Woodd, HPA CEO, and Neil Hobday, CEO of Guards Polo Club, Windsor Great Park, where the event is hosted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Telegraph understands that talks with a new sponsor for International Day are already underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Following an impressive 12-year term supporting polo, Audi has made the commercial decision not to renew its sponsorships for the England polo team, the Audi International Series and the Pony Club Polo Championships after an extensive review of the brand&#x2019;s sponsorship initiatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Woodd, CEO of the Hurlingham Polo Association, said: "It has been excellent, made a huge difference, and we are very sad it has come to an end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We have to move on. We've been working very hard to keep them in, that's been going on for a couple of months. We are obviously now reviewing the huge gap left by Audi which includes International Day, the England team and the Pony Club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Audi have done a huge amount for the England squad and the Pony Club so it will have a big impact on those. But we've got to review it and move on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jon Zammett, Head of PR for Audi UK, said in a statement: "We are very proud to have been a significant supporter of polo in the UK for more than a decade. We believe Audi has made a positive impact on the development and growing success of the national England squad, in particular, as well as the sport as a whole over the years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"However, we feel that it is now an appropriate time to embark on a new era for Audi in which we will further embrace and focus on our activities relating to the performing arts. Audi has already expanded it collaborations this year with BAFTA as well as the Royal Ballet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>However, Audi will be continuing to host its Audi Polo Challenge &#x2013; private exclusive events, which have raised more than 1.7 million over the years for various charities supported by the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>John Tinsley, who has been Chair of the HPA&#x2019;s International Committee throughout the Audi involvement in polo, added: &#x201c;Audi has had a huge impact on the sport, in particular for the England squad which has been transformed in the last 10 years and become the envy of all other countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Guards Polo Club and the HPA will now work behind the scenes to get International Day buoyant with a sponsor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It is understood moves are already underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Twitter: Malcolm Borwick - Thank you @AudiPolo for your support & contribution to polo over 12 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hobday, CEO of Guards, told Telegraph Sport on hearing of the Audi withdrawal: "It's sad and surprising sometimes but if you take Audi's commitment to English polo for over a decade, it has been a phenomenal gesture of support to a growing sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I think they should be applauded for their commitment to the sport. In organizations, sponsorship does have directional changes, from time to time. Now they are going to the arts and ballet and to something else which needs support. I think they can look back on their record in polo and be truly proud of it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It will obviously impact on International Day, the HPA's most important polo day in the season, hosted at Guard's Polo Club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"It's one of the impacts it will have," he added.</td></tr>

<tr><td>21</td><td>Hobday believes there are other "obvious" sponsors out there, with pol looking for the next generation of sponsorship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"There are some obvious ones who we will talk to immediately, and I'm sure the HPA have some ideas as well, and what we have to do is to sit around the table, come up with a plan and get on with it," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We and the HPA have been committed to International Day and the Coronation Cup for many many years, and it's been kind to both of us for many many years thanks to Audi more recently and Cartier before that, and we need to move on to the next generation of sponsorship for International Day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It will be a crucial moment for an important day in the English polo calendar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"It's a very important day for English polo," added Hobday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The important message today is one of gratitude to Audi for its sponsorship across many different levels of the sport. They've left it a better place than they found it, and I think we should all recognize that. Thank them, wish them luck in their new direction, and we as a sport, as a club, as a governing body, need to sit down and make sure we move on in a positive way."</td></tr>
