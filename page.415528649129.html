<h3>Iraq's Tikrit offensive stalled by IS bombs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Troops, police and militia fairly easily boxed the jihadists in over recent days, but mopping them up is proving to be far harder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The battle to retake Tikrit will be difficult because of the preparations (IS) made," said Jawwad al-Etlebawi, spokesman for Asaib Ahl al-Haq, a Shiite militia playing a major role in the operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"They planted bombs on all the streets, buildings, bridges, everything... Our forces were stopped by these defensive preparations," he told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We need forces trained in urban warfare to break in," he said, adding that the jihadists are surrounded and that "any besieged person fights fiercely."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The assault on Tikrit, capital of Salaheddin province, began on March 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Loyalists had already failed three times retake the city, the hometown of Saddam Hussein, which was captured by IS last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Interior Minister Mohammed Ghabban said Monday the operation had been halted to avoid casualties and to protect infrastructure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But it is unclear how anything other than an extended siege would achieve either of those objectives, unless there is additional external support, such as air strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Staff Lieutenant General Abdulwahab al-Saadi, commander for Salaheddin, told AFP Sunday his forces in Tikrit needed air support from the US-led coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said he had asked the defence ministry to request air support, but that none had yet been forthcoming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The longer the operation drags on, the longer civilians remaining in Tikrit twill be caught in the middle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Adnan Yunis, spokesman for the Red Crescent in Salaheddin, said only a maximum 20 percent of Tikrit's pre-conflict population is believed to remain in the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"They are people who stayed because they do not have enough money to leave, they don't have a car, they have a disability or because they chose to cooperate" with IS, Yunis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Iraq has formed paramilitary units dubbed the Popular Mobilisation forces to fight alongside security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They are made up largely of Shiite militiamen but some Sunni Arabs have also taken part in fighting in the Tikrit area, which is overwhelmingly Sunni Arab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>IS posted pictures Tuesday of the beheading of four men it said were recruiters for the units.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>IS has carried out numerous atrocities, including public beheadings and mass executions as well as enslavement and rape, and caused millions to be displaced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It spearheaded a sweeping offensive that overran large areas north and west of Baghdad last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It also holds significant territory in neighbouring Syria, where it has taken advantage of the four-year uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, to oust government forces and rival rebel groups from a swathe of the east and north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>To consolidate his grip on power, Assad has sought to exploit international outrage at the IS atrocities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But US officials vowed that he will never personally be a part of negotiations to end the war, after Secretary of State John Kerry appeared to suggest Washington would have to talk to him if peace is to be forged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Assad's forces have been accused of using barrel bombs -- crudely constructed weapons typically dropped by helicopter -- on rebel areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said chlorine gas appeared to have been used in one such attack in northwestern Syria late Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Three children, their mother and father, and their grandmother suffocated to death after regime barrel bomb attacks" on their village in Idlib province, the Britain-based monitoring group said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It said doctors in the village of Sarmin concluded that the manner of death indicated a gas, possibly chlorine, had been emitted from the barrel bombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The regime has been accused of using chlorine on civilians in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>IS too stands accused of using chlorine, notably in a January 23 car bomb attacks on Kurdish forces in Iraq.</td></tr>
