<h3>Islamic State issues audio of Baghdadi calling supporters to join him</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Thought to be wounded and incapacitated, this is an image of the militant leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, taken from a propaganda video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Beirut: Islamic State has issued an audio recording that it said was by its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, calling on supporters around the world to join the fight in Syria and Iraq or to take up arms wherever they live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was Baghdadi's first message since a number of media reports said that he was wounded earlier this year in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some said that he was no longer running the group and others suggested he had even died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An image of the militant thought to be at one time, and perhaps still, the leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, taken from a propaganda video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Joining (its fight) is a duty on every Muslim. We are calling on you either join or carry weapons (to fight) wherever you are."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The authenticity of the audio or its date could not be verified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An Islamic State militant holding a pistol in an image from a propaganda video released in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the message, Baghdadi tells the rulers of Saudi Arabia that "their end is near", adding that Gulf rulers felt threatened by the growing popularity of his group among Sunni Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They have lost their so called legitimacy ... when they felt that their masters, the Crusaders and the Jews, have replaced them with the Rafeda they launched their so-called war against Rafeda in Yemen," he said, using a derogatory term for Shiite Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Saudi Arabia heads a coalition of Gulf and Arab nations fighting Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"They claim that they are defending the Sunnis ... they are lying. It is a desperate attempt to deter Muslims from joining the Islamic State."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Islamic State considers all those who oppose it as infidels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The group has faced military setbacks in Iraq when Iraqi forces including Shi'ite paramilitaries retook the city of Tikrit in the first big counter-offensive since Islamic State rapidly seized swathes of territory last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the militants have struck back at the oil-producing town of Baiji and in the western province of Anbar where its move on the provincial capital of Ramadi has displaced thousands of people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Baghdadi called on those who left Ramadi to return saying: "You are our people, we will defend you ... we want your safety and security."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>With the United States conducting air strikes against Islamic State positions, rumours have circulated that Baghdadi had been seriously wounded and had handed leadership over to a deputy.</td></tr>
