<h3>Facebook clarifies rules on banned content</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 1.39-billion-member social network updated its "community standards" late Sunday, providing specific examples of content prohibited under its general rules against direct threats, hate speech and criminal activity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>While Facebook has long forbidden groups it deems to be terrorist organizations from posting content on its service, the company specified that it will remove content that expresses support for such groups or praises their leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Facebook also made clear that images "shared in revenge or without permission," often referred to as "revenge porn," are forbidden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But photos of women breastfeeding, post-mastectomy scarring and images of paintings and sculptures with nude figures are permissible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The clarification comes as social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter Inc grapple with self-regulating technology that is as easily used for harassment and online bullying as it is for sharing sports videos and news articles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Having a voice is not some absolute state. It's not the case that you either have a voice or you don't," Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on his Facebook page on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Zuckerberg said Facebook was not actually changing any of its policies or standards, but merely providing more guidance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"People rightfully want to know what content we will take down, what controversial content we'll leave up, and why," Zuckerberg wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Images of graphic violence and nudity have long been problematic for Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In 2013, Facebook said it would use a broader set of criteria to determine when gory videos are permitted on the site after a video of a masked man beheading a woman in Mexico prompted an outcry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The company has also been criticized for allowing pages that glorify violence against women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Militant groups such as Islamic State have increasingly used social media to spread their message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Facebook also said on Sunday that it recorded a slight increase in government requests for account data in the second half of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Requests for account data increased to 35,051 in the second half of 2014 from 34,946 in the first half, with requests from countries such as India rising and those from others, including the United States and Germany, falling.</td></tr>

<h3>Shotgun Players opens season of all women playwrights</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Twelve playwrights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>All women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Berkeley's Shotgun Players has long made its name by daring to dream big and take chances, but this season takes that vision to a whole new level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Inspired by the controversy that erupted in the theater world when Minnesota's Guthrie Theater company announced a 2012 season that featured no women or minority playwrights, Shotgun artistic director Patrick Dooley decided to shake things up with an all-female lineup for 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"When you have three little girls, you start to look at the world differently. I want them to have equal opportunity," says Dooley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Theater is my thing -- that's how I do my part to try and make the world a little better place. This just feels like what we should be doing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>From the esoteric (Anne Carson's "Antigonick," an adaptation of the tragedy "Antigone," part of Sophocles' trio of plays that dealt with the reign of Oedipus the King) and the historic (Aphra Behn's 1677 "The Rover") to the crowd-pleasing ("The Mousetrap"), it's a gobsmacking season that touches on a spectrum of voices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Iconic playwrights (Caryl Churchill's "Top Girls") rub elbows with 21st-century darlings (Sarah Ruhl's "Eurydice") and local emerging artists (Marisela Trevino Orta's "Heart Shaped Nebula") in this ambitious lineup of six full productions and six staged readings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This boundary-pushing Shotgun season begins March 19 with "Antigonick" and runs through January 2016 with "The Mousetrap."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"For 2,000 years, all the playwrights were male, so that is who is sitting on the shelf of your theater library, that is the path of least resistance, but there is no excuse for that now," says Dooley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We should do better than that, and we can do better than that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>For the record, the company has also broken ground on other fronts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It went to solar power at the Ashby Stage in 2007, and it recently raised $1.7 million to purchase and renovate a second space in the old Serendipity Books location at 1201 University Ave., which is now part rehearsal studio and part venue for emerging artists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But it's the all-female season, the decision to tackle the issue of representation head-on, that has generated the most buzz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Shotgun is known to be a company that takes big risks and that has formed its identity around the ability to do so," notes director Barbara Damashek, "and this is certainly a marketing risk. No question."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some have praised the project as a bold move; others think it's about time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Isn't it crazy that anyone would think it is brave to mount a season that is all women?" agrees Susie Medak, managing director of Berkeley Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Who would ever call it brave to do a season that is all men? Rather than brave, I'd agree that it offers some opportunities for real fun and, quite possibly, a really refreshing shift in perspective."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It should be noted that some have criticized the company for showcasing well-known women writers such as Churchill and Ruhl instead of helping discover new voices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Why not turn the spotlight on unknowns instead of famous names?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"It's easy to wag your finger and turn up your nose," says Dooley, who is quick to point out that Shotgun has long made new plays one of its missions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"But I love this season. I think if we are going to talk about women playwrights, these are all plays we should know and that many in my audience have not seen. I am also hoping that these are not plays where we will get mauled at the box office because the bottom line is we need to live to fight another day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Indeed, Dooley lost the rights to several hot, new plays he was hoping to snag for this project, but he is also at peace with the fact that doing something new always invites scrutiny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In the past few years, Shotgun has staged some absolutely brilliant and critically acclaimed new works, such as Linda McLean's "Strangers, Babies" and Enda Walsh's "The New Electric Ballroom," that have tanked at the box office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>So it would not be an unwelcome turn of events if "Mousetrap" packed the house, but that is not the only reason the Agatha Christie gem is in the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"My grandma took me to that play when I was a little boy, and it blew my mind," says Dooley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I am hoping it can be a gateway play for some new audiences."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Dooley is committed to maintaining gender parity going forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In fact, he had initially planned to do the all-female season but not brand it that way and just let it stand on its own, but the women on his staff convinced him that it was time to engage people in a conversation about theater and gender.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"It's not about tokenism. The artist should be the conscience of society," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"Did you know that only three women have ever won the Tony for best play? Since 1947. That's crazy. From here on out, we are shooting for 50-50 at Shotgun."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He's hoping that risk pays off over time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"It is smart of Patrick. He's a savvy guy," says Medak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Women make up more than 50 percent of all our audiences. Any astute artistic director should bear that in mind when programming."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>These women playwrights have written works that have been recently staged, or will be staged, at other area theaters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Anne Washburn: Her postmodern epic "Mr. Burns, A Post-Electric Play" is an explosive mashup of "The Simpsons," the power of storytelling and our apocalyptic zeitgeist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>It just wrapped at American Conservatory Theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Kimber Lee: Her "tokyo fish story," a comic tale of a sushi master, was the hit of TheatreWorks' new play festival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>It'll return to TheatreWorks March 9-April 3, 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Julia Cho: The up-and-coming playwright of "The Language Archive" and "The Architecture of Loss" is set to debut her latest, "Aubergine," in February 2016 at Berkeley Repertory Theatre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Danai Gurira: She might be best known as the sword-wielding Michonne on "The Walking Dead," but she's also a fierce playwright whose South African drama "The Convert" runs through March 15 at Marin Theatre Company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Caryl Churchill: Her "Top Girls" is part of the Shotgun season, but her "Love and Information," an exploration of the nature of life and technology, will get its regional debut at San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater on June 3.</td></tr>
