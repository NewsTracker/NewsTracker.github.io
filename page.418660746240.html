<tr><td>3</td><td>Mexico earned chance after chance to score against Costa Rica.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The goal that finally came might not have been so well-deserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mexico won 1-0 on Sunday night in the CONCACAF Gold Cup quarterfinals on Andres Guardado's penalty kick in the final minute of extra time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Roy Miller had been whistled for a questionable foul on Oribe Peralta with the game seconds from both teams attempting penalty kicks.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>Angry Costa Rica fans - heavily outnumbered by Mexico's supporters in the crowd of 74,187 at MetLife Stadium - threw bottles toward the field in protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With Peralta leaping to try to head in a cross in front of the goal in the second minute of stoppage time, Miller appeared to make little contact with him.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>Injury-plagued Mexico repeatedly broke down Costa Rica's defense to set up good looks only for shots to sail high or wide.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>"Unfortunately we haven't been able to be as effective as we would want to."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Carlos Esquivel nearly put Mexico ahead in the 63th minute, but goalkeeper Esteban Alvarado got his fingertips on the ball while leaning the other way to deflect it off the crossbar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Alvarado had five saves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"You have only a certain number of plays to win a game before you start suffering, and you start thinking that if you give your opponent a break, you lose," Herrera said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>That game made it to penalty kicks with the score tied 1-1, and Panama won 6-5.</td></tr>
