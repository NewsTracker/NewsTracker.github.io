<h3>Fin24.com | Facebook allowed to sue law firms over fake case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>New York - Facebook may pursue a lawsuit against law firms that represented a New York man who recently turned fugitive rather than face federal charges that he tried to defraud founder Mark Zuckerberg out of half of the company, a judge ruled on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>New York Supreme Court Justice Eileen Rakower said Facebook and Zuckerberg could move forward with a lawsuit alleging law firms, including DLA Piper LLP and Milberg LLP, maliciously prosecuted claims by Paul Ceglia that were based on forged documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Rakower said that, accepting Facebook's claims as true, its complaint adequately alleged the law firms "knew there was no basis - and therefore no probable cause - for Ceglia's claims".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Facebook in statement said it was pleaded with the ruling and would "continue to hold accountable DLA Piper and the other firms who pursued Paul Ceglia's fraudulent claims against Facebook".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A DLA Piper spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Milberg's lawyer declined comment, and a lawyer for a third firm, Lippes Mathias Wexler Friedman LLP, did not respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The ruling came a week after what would have been the May 4 start of a criminal trial in Manhattan federal court of Ceglia, a 41-year-old wood pellet salesman from Wellsville, New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Instead, Ceglia removed his electronic ankle bracelet in early March and disappeared, along with his wife, two children and a dog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His whereabouts remain unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The criminal case arose from Ceglia's June 2010 civil lawsuit in upstate New York against Menlo Park, California-based Facebook and Zuckerberg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ceglia alleged that a 2003 contract with Zuckerberg, then a Harvard University freshman who had done programming work for Ceglia's StreetFax.com, entitled him to half of Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York in April upheld the dismissal of that lawsuit, saying "overwhelming forensic evidence" showed the contract was forged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Over the years, the lawsuit was handled by several prominent law firms, including DLA Piper, one of the largest firms in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Facebook sued those firms in October, saying they knew or should have known Ceglia's lawsuit was a fraud, but ploughed ahead "for the purpose of extorting a lucrative and unwarranted settlement".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Facebook also said those lawyers stayed with the case even after a lawyer at Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman, who also represented Ceglia, warned he had found "smoking-gun" evidence of fraud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Kasowitz Benson soon withdrew from the case.</td></tr>
