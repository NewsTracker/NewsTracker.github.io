<h3>Letters signal Bali Nine execution close</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Embassies representing prisoners on death row with Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have been summoned to a meeting that could signal the executions are imminent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Utomo Karim, lawyer for Raheem Salami, said on Thursday afternoon the Nigerian embassy received a letter asking it to go to Cilacap, the port closest to Nusakambangan, on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Based on experience from the previous execution, they're going to tell them the date for the execution," he told AAP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A lawyer for Rodrigo Gularte says the Brazilian embassy revived the same letter from Indonesia's foreign ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's a letter from the foreign ministry to the embassy, asking representatives from the embassy to come to Cilacap for a meeting," Ricky Gunawan told AAP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Department of Foreign Affairs was contacted for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Indonesia is required to give 72 hours' notice of the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran are in the same cell block as Salami on Nusakambangan, where they and six other drug offenders await execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Utomo says based on the experience of the Nigerian embassy in January, when six people were executed, the Saturday meeting means the date is drawing near.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Last time, when we were asked to gather in the district prosecutor's office, we were then taken to Nusakambangan to tell the convict about the execution time," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"And three days after that, they were executed. I don't know whether other embassies have been notified at the same."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Attorney-General's spokesman Tony Spontana confirmed reports on Thursday that his office has sent letters to prosecutors advising them to prepare for the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Asked if a date was set he replied: "up to tonight, not yet".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The letters asked prosecutors to make preparations, and were not the notification letters for the convicts themselves, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran have lodged a new appeal in the constitutional court but the attorney-general says the Bali Nine pair have exhausted their legal avenues and he won't recognise the latest action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A tenth prisoner, Filipina Mary Jane Veloso, is also in line for execution but has yet to be moved to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Her lawyers were planning to file for a judicial review on Monday, with new evidence pointing to her being a victim of human trafficking, rather than a drug trafficker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Her family has arrived in Indonesia from the Philippines and was due to visit her on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The only Indonesian on death row, Zainal Abidin, still has an application for a judicial review pending in the Supreme Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Spontana told Indonesian website detik.com the date hadn't been set because of his case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We're still waiting for Zainal Abidin," he reportedly said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"When it's rejected then it will be complete, 10 convicts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 34, were arrested 10 years ago in a plot to take heroin out of Indonesia, which has so far rejected diplomatic and legal efforts for mercy.</td></tr>
