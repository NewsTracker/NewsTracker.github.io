<h3>Mats Hummels 'gave his word' to Sir Alex Ferguson he WILL join Manchester United!Â </h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As revealed by Sportsmail at the time, then-United manager Ferguson made a trip to Germany for the 2011-12 Cup final, in the hope of tying up an audacious triple transfer for Hummels, Robert Lewandowski and Shinji Kagawa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the event, he only managed to lure Kagawa to Old Trafford after Dortmund stood firm over their other two prized assets, in the wake of a stunning victory over Bayern Munich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But sources in Germany have revealed a conversation took place between Ferguson and Hummels and that the Dortmund centre-back gave his word that, if he moved abroad, it would be to Old Trafford.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With the 26-year old now indicating he is ready to quit the Westfalenstadion at the end of a traumatic Bundesliga campaign for Dortmund, after years of remaining loyal to them, it confirms he is likely to become the cornerstone of a new-look United defence next season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Dortmund will hold out for around 36million for their stylish defender but that will not stop Louis van Gaal pushing through a deal as part of another lavish spending spree this summer.</td></tr>
