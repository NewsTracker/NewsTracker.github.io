    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Liberia, one of the countries hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic, reports its first new case since being declared free of the lethal virus seven weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London: Experts have recommended urgent, root-and-branch changes to the World Health Organisation after an inadequate response to West Africa's vast and deadly Ebola outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN agency "does not currently possess the capacity or organisational culture to deliver a full emergency public health response", a panel of independent experts said in a report on the WHO's handling of the Ebola crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The house where the 17-year-old lived before he died of Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said that WHO leaders should have declared the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency much sooner than they did, and that the delay stemmed in part from not wanting to challenge governments worried about negative economic and trade consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebola health workers spray disinfectant on an ambulance that was used to transport two people suspected of having the Ebola virus on the outskirts of Monrovia earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health workers take a blood specimen from a child to test for the Ebola virus in the district where the 17-year-old had lived.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;FILE - In this Wednesday, March 11, 2015 file photo, health workers carry a body of a person that they suspected died form the Ebola virus at a new graveyard on the outskirts of Monrovia, Liberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A panel commissioned by the World Health Organization to assess its bungled response to the world's biggest Ebola outbreak said the crisis exposed the agency's "organizational failings" and called for WHO to be held accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its final report issued on Tuesday, July 7, 2015 the panel said WHO's sluggish efforts to contain Ebola were partly explained by "a hope that the crisis could be managed by good diplomacy."&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
