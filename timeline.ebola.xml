    <title>&lt;p&gt;When aid agency Doctors Without Borders warned Ebola was spiraling out of control, WHO contradicted it, even as WHO's own scientists called for backup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ebola continued to spread in the summer, the situation on the ground grew increasingly desperate, with only a fraction of the needed treatment beds available in Liberia and Sierra Leone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was around that time that West Africa's Ebola epidemic surpassed the previous largest outbreak, in Uganda, where it infected 425 people in 2000 and killed about half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinean officials' insistence on only reporting confirmed cases was intended to "minimize artificially the magnitude of the Ebola outbreak to reassure expatriates working in the mining industry," Formenty, the WHO Ebola expert, wrote in another trip report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 4, scientist Lucien Manga wrote to Briand to tell her senior staff in Africa had proposed declaring the Ebola outbreak a global emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infectious diseases expert Osterholm said the global health agency isn't the only one to be blamed and that the entire world failed to respond quickly enough to stop Ebola from becoming a humanitarian disaster.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;The number of Ebola cases in the region has fallen in recent months, though a spike in Guinea highlights the risk of complacency, over a year into the worst outbreak on record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rains are due to begin in May. The World Health Organization has said they could greatly complicate the fight against Ebola by washing away roads and making it harder for aid and health-care workers to get to affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest figures issued by the WHO showed that there had been 10,216 confirmed, probable and suspected deaths from Ebola in West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinea, where the outbreak was first identified, has recorded 2,231 confirmed and probable deaths from Ebola but has seen a recent spike, with the number of patients more than doubling since last month.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;The health agency's vaccination strategy in Guinea aims to create a buffer zone around an Ebola case to prevent its further spread - an approach used to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO also said unsafe traditional burials - a high-risk factor for Ebola transmission - continue to occur in both Guinea and Sierra Leone, and health workers in those countries are still being attacked by those wary of their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials also said the number of Ebola deaths taking place outside of hospitals still remains high in Guinea and Sierra Leone, "suggesting that the need for early isolation and treatment is not yet understood, accepted or acted upon."&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;The countries at the center of the Ebola epidemic are forecast to lose 12 percent of their combined gross domestic product this year, according to World Bank estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, their health sectors have been partially wiped out by the epidemic, or forced to divert resources to fighting Ebola at the expense of other diseases like measles, malaria and AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries around the world have so far pledged $5.1 billion to fight Ebola, with $2.4 billion disbursed until now, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;</title>
