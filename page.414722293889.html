<h3>Confusing unisex toilet signs in Swedish library throw visitors off balance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A sign hanging between the toilet doors showed a male and a female figure, with arrows pointing in both directions, local media reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"You usually look for a man or a woman, but here they've got both symbols," one library visitor, Ida Lundstrom, complained to Swedish public broadcaster SVT, the Local reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While some remained at a loss, others rushed to take an advantage of an opportunity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I think it's great. Otherwise the men's toilet is usually available but there's a line to the ladies," Asa Agren Wikstrom told SVT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Meanwhile, the library's section head said the arrows on the new sign actually show that you can use either toilet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The arrows don't mean that women should go left and men right," Maria Westerlund explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"But I understand it can be mistaken for a ladies' toilet and a gentlemen's toilet," she admitted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's always very difficult to be clear when it comes to signs - they can always be understood in different ways. But if this ends up causing problems we may have to look at other options," Westerlund said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Last year it was announced that the groundbreaking gender-neutral pronoun "hen" will be included into the new Swedish dictionary, compiled by the country's Academy, in 2015, after years of debate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The pronoun will have two uses: for cases when the gender is unknown or irrelevant, or if the information is viewed as irrelevant.</td></tr>
