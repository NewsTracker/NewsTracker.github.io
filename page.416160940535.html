<h3>AP Source: QB Johnny Manziel released from rehab (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The popular Browns quarterback was released from a rehab facility Saturday after more than 10 weeks, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 2012 Heisman Trophy winner from Texas A&M entered the undisclosed clinic, which specializes in drug and alcohol rehabilitation, on Jan. 28 for treatment of an unspecified problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Manziel is expected to participate in Cleveland's offseason workouts beginning April 20, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of privacy issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Manziel had been allowed to leave for short periods over the past month and visited a hospital earlier in the week as part of his treatment program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Browns owner Jimmy Haslam and coach Mike Pettine have publicly pledged their support of Manziel, emphasizing that his personal recovery comes ahead of football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Pettine visited Manziel while he was in rehab and reported he was making good progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''Football, it's a back seat,'' Pettine said at the owners meetings last month in Phoenix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''For his football life to get it where it needs to be, he needs to get the personal life where it needs to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Manziel's release was first reported by ESPN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The team remains optimistic about Manziel, who was drafted with the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>22 overall pick in last year's NFL draft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Manziel spent most of his rookie season backing up Brian Hoyer before playing poorly in two starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Manziel joined the Browns with the reputation as a party boy, and he didn't do anything to refute that image when he was photographed in nightclubs before he even went to training camp with Cleveland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Browns insisted they weren't going to micro-manage any of their players, and throughout the season Pettine said Manziel was working hard and taking the necessary steps to become a better player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But after his poor on-field performance - he was injured in his second start - Manziel acknowledged he should have taken his job more seriously and vowed to come back for his second season more prepared and focused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''I did grow up and then I took a step back,'' he said after last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''It is the same story with me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Manziel showed he was serious when he checked himself into the facility, a decision met with approval by the Browns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They still believe Manziel can be a dependable quarterback, and he is expected to compete for the starting job this year along with 11-year veteran Josh McCown, signed as a free agent during the offseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Cleveland also hired quarterbacks coach Kevin O'Connell, who worked with Manziel before last year's draft and has a strong relationship with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Haslam has said finding a franchise quarterback is the team's No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>1 priority, and there's a chance the Browns could use one of their two first-round picks in this year's draft to find one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It's also possible they'll trade up in hopes of selecting Oregon's Marcus Mariota, considered the best QB in this class behind Florida State's Jameis Winston.</td></tr>
