<h3>Podcast: Anatomy Of An Assassination</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>And the way various Kremlin-watchers have interpreted it says a lot about how each views Russia.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>Joining me is co-host Mark Galeotti, a professor at NYU, an expert on Russia's security services, and author of the blog In Moscow's Shadows; and Sean Guillory of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Russian and Eastern European Studies, author of Sean's Russia blog, and host of the newly launched SRB Podcast.</td></tr>
