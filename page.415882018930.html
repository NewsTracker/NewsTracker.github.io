<h3>Tennessee hires former Texas coach Rick Barnes (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Just two days after leaving Texas, Rick Barnes has landed at Tennessee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tennessee announced the hiring Tuesday, calling Barnes an ''elite basketball coach in every respect.'' The agreement is for six years at $2.25 million annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The school scheduled an afternoon news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Barnes succeeds Donnie Tyndall, who was fired Friday after one season amid an NCAA investigation of his two years at Southern Mississippi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Barnes went 402-180 at Texas and reached the NCAA Tournament in 16 of his 17 seasons, including a Final Four appearance in 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''Rick brings an extremely impressive track record of excellence, as well as much-needed stability, to our men's basketball program,'' Tennessee athletic director Dave Hart said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Texas announced his departure Sunday, saying it was a mutual decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Barnes made it clear at his farewell news conference that he was fired and that he told Texas athletic director Steve Patterson he wanted to stay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Barnes said he was given the choice of firing his staff or being fired himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The 60-year-old Barnes is 604-314 in 28 seasons overall with stops at George Mason, Providence and Clemson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He has reached the NCAA Tournament in 19 of his last 20 seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hart said he fired Tyndall for cause after determining the NCAA would likely find the coach committed major violations while at Southern Mississippi from 2012-14.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tyndall went 16-16 in his lone season at Tennessee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Although Barnes' only Southeastern Conference experience came during a brief stint as an Alabama assistant in 1985-86, Barnes has some familiarity with the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He grew up in Hickory, North Carolina, about 200 miles east of Tennessee's Knoxville campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Barnes takes over a Tennessee program that has gone at least as far as the NCAA regional semifinals four of the last nine seasons despite encountering plenty of recent coaching turnover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Bruce Pearl was fired in 2011 amid an NCAA investigation after leading Tennessee to NCAA Tournament appearances in each of his six seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Pearl was replaced by Cuonzo Martin, who left for California after earning one NCAA invitation and two spots in the NIT in his three seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tyndall took over for Martin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Tennessee loses all-SEC guard Josh Richardson to graduation and doesn't return any proven point guards or post scorers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Barnes' 402 wins at Texas were the most in school history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Kevin Durant and T.J. Ford earned national player of the year honors while starring on Barnes' teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He led Texas to the Sweet 16 five times, one Final Four and three trips to the regional finals - but hadn't advanced the Longhorns beyond the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament since 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Hiring a veteran coach from a Big 12 school represents a change of pace for Tennessee, which selected head coaches from the mid-major ranks for its last four hires: Buzz Peterson (Tulsa), Pearl (Wisconsin-Milwaukee), Martin (Missouri State) and Tyndall (Southern Mississippi).</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Tennessee becomes the second SEC school to hire a veteran coach with Final Four experience this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mississippi State announced last week it was replacing the fired Rick Ray with 57-year-old Ben Howland, who made three consecutive Final Four appearances with UCLA from 2006-08.</td></tr>
