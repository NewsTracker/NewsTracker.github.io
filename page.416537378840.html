<h3>Family, Friends in Baltimore Mourn Death of Arrested Man</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Police line a street in downtown Baltimore in response to protests that followed a rally for Freddie Gray, Saturday, April 25, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A night of violence gave way to a day of mourning Sunday for a man who died after sustaining serious injuries while in the custody of Baltimore police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Pastor Jamal Bryant told the congregation at Empowerment Temple AME Church that "somebody is going to have to pay" for the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died a week after an encounter with police left him with serious injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Bryant told churchgoers, almost all of them black, that if "you're black in America your life is always under threat."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bryant also addressed the violence that erupted Saturday night during what began as a peaceful demonstration attended by more than a thousand people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Some 34 people were arrested, according to Baltimore Police Department, and six police officers sustained minor injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>After services were over Bryant, whose church will pay for Gray's funeral, met with the family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said after the meeting that they are "holding on" and that they don't want violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bryant said marches and demonstrations would continue but that "violence never leads to justice."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A wake was being held Sunday afternoon at Vaughn Green East funeral home, and Gray's funeral is planned for Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Police said extra officers would be deployed throughout the city over the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Just before nightfall Saturday, groups of protesters marched from City Hall to the Camden Yards baseball stadium, where the Baltimore Orioles played the Boston Red Sox.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Fans were told to briefly stay inside the stadium until the police were able to clear an intersection outside of the venue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>However, a smaller group apparently splintered off and looted a convenience store, threw tables and chairs through storefront windows, shattering the glass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>One group smashed the window of a department store inside a downtown mall and, at one point, a protester tossed a flaming metal garbage can toward a line of police officers in riot gear as they tried to push back the crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Earlier, a group of protesters smashed the windows of at least three police cars and got into fights with baseball fans outside a bar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Fire officials said roughly 1,200 protesters gathered at City Hall Saturday afternoon to protest Gray's death, which has prompted near-daily demonstrations since he died April 19.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Gray was arrested one week before that when officers chased him through a West Baltimore neighborhood and dragged him into a police van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Police acknowledged Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested - before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the Police Department's policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Gray was arrested after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into the van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Gray asked for medical help several times, beginning before he was placed in the van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>After a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Authorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured.</td></tr>
