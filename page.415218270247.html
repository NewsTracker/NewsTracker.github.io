<h3>Holiday 'taught Ferguson discipline'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But the project took on personal significance after the singer had a "year of loss and sadness".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Billie Holiday had one of the most distinctive voices of all time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Her intensely personal style, on songs like Strange Fruit, Lover Man and Don't Explain, inspired everyone from Janis Joplin to Joni Mitchell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One of the first singers to employ the subtleties of jazz phrasing in a serious manner, she danced around the beat and the melody, often adding harmonies inspired by her favourite horn players Louis Armstrong and Lester Young.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But she is also remembered for her turbulent personal life - born to teenage parents who couldn't cope, jailed for prostitution in her own teenage years, and dying, aged 44, while under arrest in her hospital bed for possession of narcotics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dozens of events are planned to celebrate the centenary of her birth this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Among those paying tribute is Rebecca Ferguson, whose third album is a collection of Billie Holiday covers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It was recorded after a turbulent year, which began with the pop star collapsing on live television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She later found out she was pregnant - at which point the father of her unborn child walked away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>All the pain was channelled into recording Lady Sings the Blues, which she made at the iconic Capitol Studios in Hollywood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She tells the BBC that revisiting Holiday's back catalogue taught her discipline and humility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>How much of Billie Holiday's story did you know before you made this record?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Actually, I'd done a project on her at college.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I remember sitting in the library having to read through book after book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>And I had to get her death certificate and other pieces of information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A lot of her life frustrated me and upset me, to be honest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>I remember looking at a picture and seeing all these terrible men round her, and I was thinking, "What are you doing? How do you not know you're Billie Holiday?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But this project has made me delve into her story even more - and I've come out respecting her as a woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>I've listened to her interviews and she was actually really strong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>As well as having addictions and making a lot of bad decisions, she was a fighter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She got up on that stage and she'd sing, no matter what.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She encountered a lot of prejudice in her early days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>She was the only black person in those clubs sometimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The band would all be able to have drinks at the bar, and she'd just be hiding at the back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>That's so sad because, as a singer, you already feel vulnerable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But she was a tough cookie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>When Bob Dylan released his album of Frank Sinatra standards last month, he said he had to ignore the originals to be able to inhabit the songs himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Do you agree?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Absolutely - you can't think about the originals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>I said to them, "Play me it twice and that's it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>I had to go in and interpret it in my own way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>If you over-listen to the song, you'll just sound like a silly mimic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>But some of her lyrics were quite dark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>In My Man, she sings: "I love him. I don't know why I should. He isn't good, he isn't true. He beats me, too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>But what I loved with Billie Holiday is she had a good way of parlaying the sorrow with a positive musical twist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Discipline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Working with people who played with Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr, Tony Some of them are 80 years of age and they just knew what they were doing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Was it a quick album to record?</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>I imagine the arrangements were done and you came in and put your vocals on top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>No, it's hard work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>It's harder than writing your own music, because they're classics and you're conscious of the fact that you've got to draw out your own emotional connection to the song.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The band had to play around me, but I was lucky in that respect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The musicians were that good that I didn't have anything to argue about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>They'd sit and play and then they'd ask me, "What did you think of that, Bex?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>And I'd always go, "It sounds amazing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>One of them actually said to me, "You're a cool cat, Rebecca, you're really chilled."</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>But that's been their field of work for 50 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>I'm not going to come in and tell them to do it differently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>How intimidating was it to sing in front of those people?</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>I was just sitting there like a big kid!</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>I kept trying to get stories out of them all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>One told me a story about Sammy Davis Jr and a time all the lights went off while he was performing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>They had just one spotlight and he had to entertain the audience for an hour - and all he did was tap dance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>How's your tap dancing?</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Oh, me tap dancing's terrible!</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>I'd just walk off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>I'd be like, "Send them all home!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>What's the biggest disaster you've ever had on stage?</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>My first ever date on my first tour, the sound completely cut out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>So I had to go on and just shout loudly to the audience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Around this time last year, you passed out while performing on Loose Women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>That must have been pretty awful, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>That was the pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>I didn't know [I was pregnant] at the time - and that was what made me go and get a test.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>My body was doing all kinds of crazy things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>I had quite a hard pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>I was vomiting constantly, it was very draining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Luckily she [third child Arabella] is absolutely fabulous and worth it all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>You've said quite openly that 2014 was "a year of loss, a year of sadness and drama".</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Did that all feed into the recording?</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>It definitely did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Certain songs, like Embraceable You, I sung that to my baby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>It was a very bad year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>I think at one point when I'm older I might open up a bit more about that, but out of respect for my daughter and my children I don't want to talk about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>But it was very hard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>You recorded the album during your pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Did that change your voice at all?</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Do you know what?</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>I found I sang better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>It makes no sense because it's supposed to affect it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>But I found all the hormones relax me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>I felt like when I sang it flowed better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>You certainly look relaxed in the "making of" video - as if taking on these Billie Holiday songs is a walk in the park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>I didn't know they were going to use that footage!</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>I was rocking up, pregnant belly, sandwich in one hand - "Come on then, let's have it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Is that your secret?</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>Always turn up to a session with a sandwich?</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>No, no, no!</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>Oh god, I'm really portraying myself as a big, greasy woman!</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>I'm not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>I have smoothies and organic food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>Rebecca Ferguson's album, Lady Sings the Blues, is released on 9 March.</td></tr>
