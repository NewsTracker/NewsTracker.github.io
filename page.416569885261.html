<tr><td>13</td><td>"It is very difficult to reach them," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"They are cut off by road slides on the mountain roads, and the wind and rain is making it difficult for helicopters to land."</td></tr>

<tr><td>16</td><td>Chaos reigned back at Kathmandu's small airport, with the onslaught of relief flights creating major backups on the tarmac.</td></tr>

<tr><td>31</td><td>Timalsina said 223 people had been confirmed dead in Gorkha district but he presumed "the number would go up because there are thousands who are injured."</td></tr>

<tr><td>36</td><td>Another 61 were killed in neighboring India, and China's official Xinhua News Agency reported 25 dead in Tibet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>At least 18 of the dead were killed at Mount Everest as the quake unleashed an avalanche that buried part of the base camp packed with foreign climbers preparing to make their summit attempts.</td></tr>

<tr><td>51</td><td>Among them was Prabina Mainali, a 26-year-old teacher who gave birth to a boy Monday in a Kathmandu hospital - a bit of good news in a sea of despair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>"It's hard that he can't be in his own home right now. He should be there, we should be there, but we aren't safe. We're afraid of the aftershocks," Mainali said, feeding the as-yet unnamed infant from a bottle as a half-dozen relatives cooked a meal on a gas cooker outside the tent in a grassy park.</td></tr>
