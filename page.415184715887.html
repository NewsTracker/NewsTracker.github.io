<h3>Furey: Netanyahu gets it right</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (L), R-KY, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (R), D-NV, pose with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of a meeting at the US Capitol on March 3, 2015 in Washington, DC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This whole Benjamin Netanyahu fiasco wouldn't happen in Canada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That's because Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government has been steadfast and unapologetic in supporting Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In contrast, President Barack Obama almost acts as if Iran's friendship is equally important to the United States as Israel's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>So the fiasco isn't Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech on the Iran comprehensive nuclear agreement that he gave before Congress Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It's how the White House dealt with the speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>House Speaker John Boehner didn't go through proper protocol in inviting the Israeli PM.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Obama used this matter of decorum as an excuse to not meet with Netanyahu and then criticize his speech afterwards as "nothing new" and adding no "viable alternatives."</td></tr>
