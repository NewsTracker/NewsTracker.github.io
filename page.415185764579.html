<h3>Hillary?s use of private email at state dept sparks row</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apparently private email ID to conduct official business is a strict no-no while in government service because the entire official correspondence of cabinet level officials is turned over to government archives under a Federal Records Act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Secretary Clinton did not bother to get a government email address during her four-year tenure at the State Department, and no one seems to have pointed out to her that she was in violation of government rules, with aides taking no action to at least move her emails from the service she used to a government server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But two months ago, in response to a new State Department effort to have all officials comply with federal record-keeping practices, her advisers began reviewing her emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They eventually turned over some 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department even as government watchdogs called it a serious breach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A Clinton spokesman told the New York Times, which first broke the story, that the former Secretary had been complying with the "letter and spirit of the rules," but he did not explain how.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>We have sent you a verification email.</td></tr>

<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - The St. Louis suburb of Ferguson says it's received a copy of the Justice Department report on its investigation into the police force.</td></tr>
