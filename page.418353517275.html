<h3>Could Edward Snowden Go Home a Hero?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Could Edward Snowden Go Home a Hero?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Also: Bernie Sanders May Burn Out Early, and the Confederate Flag Returns to Florida.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Glenn Greenwald, Call Your Office (And Bring Smelling Salts): In an interview with Yahoo News, former Attorney General Eric Holder says that Edward Snowden, the exiled National Security Agency leaker who dished the dirt on U.S. spying on its own citizens, could get a Justice Department deal that might allow him to return to the U.S. -- and not via the Guantanamo Bay detention center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In fact, Holder seemed to imply that Snowden deserved a hearty round of applause rather than a decade behind bars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The nation, he said, is "in a different place as a result of the Snowden disclosures" and that "his actions spurred a necessary debate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A spokeswoman for Attorney General Loretta Lynch threw a big bucket of ice water on any talk of a deal, pointing out that Snowden is still under indictment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Still, clemency doesn't seem so far-fetched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Consider: Holder, President Barack Obama's self-described "wingman," has only been out of office for two months and change, and probably still has back-channel access to his old boss and longtime friend; at the same time, after slamming him for doing "unnecessary damage" to the national security apparatus Obama grudgingly acknowledged Snowden probably did the nation a solid by prompting "a conversation we needed to have" as one nation under surveillance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Not to mention the White House probably considers two winters spent in Russia, not exactly a bastion of freedom and democracy, is probably punishment enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The L Word: He's irascible, he's rumpled, he's a white-haired septuagenarian and he seems more like the angry uncle you're not sure you want to sit besides at Thanksgiving dinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Yet Sen. Bernie Sanders, Independent presidential candidate and would-be political giant-killer, has begun packing them in everywhere he goes -- including drawing a 2008-Obama-like 10,000 people to a rally in Wisconsin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His fundraising is on the uptick, and, as an unabashed liberal who isn't running from the word "socialist" at the end of his title, he's got a burgeoning reputation as the most authentic candidate this election cycle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But his authenticity could be his ultimate undoing: Some Democratic heavy hitters (and Hillary Clinton supporters like Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat) say Sanders' Howard Beale act may be getting rave reviews in the pre-primary season and getting the liberal base fired up, but his fire-and-brimstone message of wealth redistribution and lock-up-Wall-Street prophesy probably won't play in Peoria, and may not even make it out of Iowa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That's because, although caucus-goers on the left are turning out to hear his message, it'll be a different story when they decide who should be the party standard-bearer, and if Sanders has a realistic shot to win the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Rally Round the Flag: In South Carolina, the august members of the state Senate met in solemn conclave and decided that, in the aftermath of the slaying of nine African American churchgoers, the Confederate flag that seemed to inspire their alleged killer should be permanently retired from the grounds of the state's capitol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In Marion County, Florida, however, the five-member County Commission decided that a week's tribute to the dead was probably long enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The commission on Tuesday unanimously voted to return the rebel flag to its position waving over the county seat in one of the Sunshine State's largest cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But it's not surprising that the decision to put the flag back up got the support of the public: the county is 83 percent white and 13 percent black, yet the commissioners are all white, and the county seat is closer to Georgia than it is to more-cosmopolitan Miami.</td></tr>
