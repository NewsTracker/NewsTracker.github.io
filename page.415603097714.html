<h3>Tunisia museum terrorists were trained in Libya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The two terrorists who attacked a museum in Tunisia and slaughtered 21 people were trained to kill in the neighboring country of Libya - which has become a stronghold for Islamic jihadists who have pledged their allegiance to ISIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Rafik Chelli, a top Tunisian security official, said Friday that the extremists had received extensive weapons training in the North African nation before eventually returning home to commit bloodshed in the capital of Tunis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The pair were activated from sleeper cells in Tunisia on Wednesday before setting their sights on the crowded Bardo National Museum - where they gunned down unsuspecting tourists getting off buses and killed hostages during a standoff with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They left the country illegally last December for Libya, and they were able to train with weapons there," Chelli told private broadcaster El Hiwar El Tounsi TV, adding that Tunisia's security forces were working to break up the terrorist cells embedded around the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Authorities did not have further details about where or with which group they had trained, Chelli said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>ISIS has claimed responsibility for the Bardo attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Several well-armed groups in Libya, which borders Tunisia, have pledged their allegiance to the Islamic State.</td></tr>

<h3>Berlin show honors pioneering ZERO movement of 50s and 60s</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The exhibition at Berlin's Martin-Gropius-Bau museum, which opens to the public on Saturday, brings together 200 works from 1957 to 1967.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It features work from artists such as co-founders Heinz Mack and Otto Piene as well as Jean Tinguely, Lucio Fontana and Jef Verheyen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The ZERO movement, which brought together more than 40 artists from several European countries, sought to overcome the pessimism of the postwar period and embrace technical progress, experimenting with light, high-tech materials and motion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It is a precursor of the conceptual art of later decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mack, 84, said at the exhibition's presentation Friday that the movement sprang from a period in which "our surroundings were very ugly - they consisted only of rubble, gray and dirt."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mack stressed the importance of experimenting with light to ZERO's work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A room in the exhibition is dedicated to his shimmering metal and glass columns and other works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Fellow German Guenther Uecker's "Cosmic Vision," featuring five revolving, nail-studded disks, lights up one wall, while Piene's "White Light Spirit" sends white light sweeping over a set of chess piece-like structures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"ZERO is freedom, it is openness, it is a point that you can always return to," Dutch artist Herman de Vries said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Berlin show runs through June 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It is one of three major recent or planned exhibitions on ZERO, following a show at the Guggenheim Museum that opened last October and ahead of another scheduled for July at Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum.</td></tr>
