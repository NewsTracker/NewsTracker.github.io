<h3>Tunisia museum terrorists were trained in Libya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The two terrorists who attacked a museum in Tunisia and slaughtered 21 people were trained to kill in the neighboring country of Libya - which has become a stronghold for Islamic jihadists who have pledged their allegiance to ISIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Rafik Chelli, a top Tunisian security official, said Friday that the extremists had received extensive weapons training in the North African nation before eventually returning home to commit bloodshed in the capital of Tunis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The pair were activated from sleeper cells in Tunisia on Wednesday before setting their sights on the crowded Bardo National Museum - where they gunned down unsuspecting tourists getting off buses and killed hostages during a standoff with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They left the country illegally last December for Libya, and they were able to train with weapons there," Chelli told private broadcaster El Hiwar El Tounsi TV, adding that Tunisia's security forces were working to break up the terrorist cells embedded around the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Authorities did not have further details about where or with which group they had trained, Chelli said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>ISIS has claimed responsibility for the Bardo attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Several well-armed groups in Libya, which borders Tunisia, have pledged their allegiance to the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Police in Tunisia have arrested five people described as directly tied to the two gunmen as well as four others in central Tunisia said to be supporters of their cell.</td></tr>
