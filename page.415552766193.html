<h3>Palestinians want world pressure on Israel after Netanyahu win</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Netanyahu's surprise victory, after pledging in the final days of the campaign that there would be no Palestinian state as long as he was in power, left Palestinians grim about prospects for a negotiated solution to a decades-old conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It is clear Israel has voted for burying the peace process, against the two-state choice and for the continuation of occupation and settlement," Saeb Erekat, chief Palestinian negotiator in talks with Israel that collapsed in April, told Voice of Palestine radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Seeking to shore up right-wing votes and saying that Islamist militants would move into any territory relinquished by Israel, Netanyahu also vowed to keep building settlements on occupied land Palestinians seek for a state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Palestinian leaders said a fourth term for the Likud party leader meant they must press forward with unilateral steps toward independence, including filing charges against Israel at the International Criminal Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This makes it more necessary than ever to go to the international community, and to go to the ICC and escalate peaceful resistance and boycott against the occupation," Wasel Abu Youssef, a Palestine Liberation Organization leader, told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Palestinians are due to become ICC members on April 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Erekat called in a statement on the international community to back Palestinian efforts "to internationalize our struggle for dignity and freedom through the International Criminal Court and through all other peaceful means."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Netanyahu's stand against a Palestinian state had already threatened to strain ties with the United States and Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The parliaments of several European countries, including Britain and France, have called on their governments to recognize an independent state of Palestine in the past year, reflecting exasperation at continued settlement building on occupied land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sweden formally recognized Palestine in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Netanyahu, who in 2009 had endorsed the two-state solution, seemed on course to form a coalition government leaning further to the right than his outgoing cabinet, which had included two centrist parties and engaged in the U.S-brokered peace talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In his new coalition, Netanyahu is expected to include his natural allies, religious and far-right parties, as well as one centrist party which campaigned on internal social-economic issues rather than on matters of war and peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Yariv Oppenheimer, head of the Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now, said he was concerned that as head of rightist-dominated government, Netanyahu would move forward more easily toward expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, enclaves many countries view as illegal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Netanyahu's masquerade is over. Everything's clear now, we're talking about a man who has sworn allegiance to the right, not about a centrist," Oppenheimer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Adding to Palestinian frustration is Israel's January decision to withhold $127 million tax revenues it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, a retaliatory step after the Palestinians moved to join the ICC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Though Israeli officials have indicated no imminent change, Gaza-based political analyst Hani Habeeb said Netanyahu may unfreeze the funds, which cover around two-thirds of the Palestinian budget, now that the election is over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I do not rule out Netanyahu releasing the PA tax revenues to improve his (international) image," Habeeb said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"He used it as a card during the election campaign and now he won."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Erekat suggested the Palestinians may press on with their pledge this month to suspend security coordination with Israel, a move that could have an immediate impact on stability in the West Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But Nabil Abu Rdainah, spokesman for President Mahmoud Abbas, did not close the door completely on negotiations with Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We are not bothered by who is head of government in Israel, what we want from the Israeli government is to recognize the two-state solution and that east Jerusalem be the capital of the state of Palestine," he said.</td></tr>

<h3>Protesters, police clash near new European bank HQ in Frankfurt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Anti-capitalist protesters clashed with riot police near the new headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt on Wednesday and set fire to barricades and cars, casting a pall over the ceremonial opening of the billion-euro skyscraper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Some 94 police officers were injured by stones and tear gas flung by a violent minority from within the 3,500 protesters, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Rally organizers said there were 7,000 protesters, more than 100 of whom were injured by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Seven police cars were set on fire, streets were blocked by burning stacks of tyres and rubbish bins, and shops were damaged in the city center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Dark smoke billowed in front of the 185-metre high ECB towers and over Frankfurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Police used water cannon to try to make a path through the mass of black-clad protesters to the entrance of the building, blocked off from the street by barricades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A total of 550 protesters were detained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Police were attacked with stones and spray. Due to the extreme violence we saw in the morning, we have to assume it could happen again," a police spokeswoman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Protesters gather during an anti-capitalist demonstration in Frankfurt March 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>ECB President Mario Draghi addressed the demonstrators in his speech at the opening ceremony but said they were missing the point by blaming the ECB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"European unity is being strained," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"People are going through very difficult times. There are some, like many of the protesters outside today, who believe the problem is that Europe is doing too little.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"But the euro area is not a political union of the sort where some countries permanently pay for others," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It has always been understood that countries have to be able to stand on their own two feet - that each is responsible for its own policies. The fact that some had to go through a difficult period of adjustment was therefore not a choice that was imposed on them. It was a consequence of their past decisions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>German leaders condemned the violence while defending the right to protest against the ECB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"No one has the right to endanger the life of police and fire officials," Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told a news conference in Berlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Our protest is against the ECB, as a member of the troika, that, despite the fact that it is not democratically elected, hinders the work of the Greek government. We want the austerity politics to end," Ulrich Wilken, one of the organizers, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We want a loud but peaceful protest," he told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Blockupy says it represents grass-roots critics of supranational financial institutions including the "troika": the ECB, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund, whose inspectors monitor countries such as Greece and Cyprus that have received international bailouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The ECB is also influential as a provider of finance to the banks of struggling countries and has in recent weeks sanctioned a drip feed of extra emergency finance to Greece's lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis last week criticized ECB policy towards Athens as "asphyxiating", a criticism also made by the protest organizers.</td></tr>
