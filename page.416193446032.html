<h3>Duncan leads Spurs to rout of Suns for 11th straight win (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>San Antonio a half-game ahead of Memphis for the Southwest Division lead and second place in the Western Conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Spurs didn't trail after the Suns' opening basket and won for the 21st time in 24 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kawhi Leonard had 18 points and nine rebounds, Marco Belinelli added 13 points and Tony Parker had 10 points and five assists for San Antonio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gerald Green had 23 points and Eric Bledsoe had 20 points and 10 assists to lead Phoenix, which has lost four straight and nine of 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Spurs failed to make a basket for 4:20 bridging the first and second quarters but never relinquished their lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>San Antonio then had a 15-6 run in taking a 38-24 lead midway through the second quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Spurs' efforts even drew some on-court praise from coach Gregg Popovich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Parker stole the ball near midcourt during the fourth quarter and raced in for a layup, prompting claps of appreciation and ''good jobs'' from Popovich during the ensuing timeout by Phoenix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Suns: The Suns were assessed a technical foul at the start of the second quarter because G Jerel McNeal was not listed on their active roster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>McNeal, who was signed to a 10-day contract, entered the game with 2:24 remaining in the first quarter in place of Bledsoe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He played the remainder of the period before the error was caught prior to the start of the second quarter.</td></tr>
