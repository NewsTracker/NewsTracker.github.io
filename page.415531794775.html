<h3>U.S. Air Force veteran accused of trying to assist Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A federal grand jury in New York City indicted Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh for attempting to provide material support to the group and attempted obstruction of justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pugh, 47, of Neptune, N.J., is to be arraigned Wednesday morning in federal court in Brooklyn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Michael Schneider, a court-appointed lawyer for Pugh, said his client would plead not guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prosecutors allege that Pugh, once an avionics instrument system specialist in the U.S. Air Force, attempted to join Islamic State in January by traveling from Egypt to Turkey and trying to cross the border into Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Turkish authorities sent him back to Egypt, which detained him and subsequently deported him to the United States, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Upon his arrival in Egypt, Pugh was carrying several electronic devices, including a mobile phone that had a photograph of a machine gun, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the United States, federal agents searched his laptop computer and other devices and found recent Internet searches for "borders controlled by Islamic State" and a propaganda video by the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Although Pugh was arrested in January, the case had been sealed until Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prosecutors said that in the weeks prior to traveling to Egypt, Pugh had been fired from his job as an airplane mechanic for an unidentified company in the Middle East and had lived abroad for a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Pugh appeared to have been on U.S. authorities' radar for some time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A criminal complaint filed at the time of his arrest said that while he was working as a mechanic for American Airlines, a co-worker tipped the FBI that Pugh "sympathized with Osama bin Laden, felt that the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies were justified and expressed anti-American sentiment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In 2002, an associate told the FBI that Pugh expressed interest in going to Chechnya to fight, the complaint said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Despite that background, from October 2009 to March 2010, Pugh worked on aircraft avionics as an Army contractor for DynCorp International in Iraq, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A company spokeswoman had no immediate comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The complaint said from 1986 to 1990, Pugh served in the U.S. Air Force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He converted to Islam after moving to San Antonio, Texas, in 1998 and "became increasingly radical in his beliefs," it said.</td></tr>

<h3>EU steps up war on people-smugglers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The maritime intelligence unit, called "JOT (Joint Operational Team) Mare", is based at Europol HQ in The Hague.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The UK and 12 other EU countries are involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>JOT Mare will help the EU border agency Frontex and national police to track and stop the gangs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Italy and Malta have faced a surge of migrant boats heading for their shores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The EU says the chaos in war-torn Libya has created fertile ground for the smuggling gangs to send dangerously overladen migrant boats towards Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>More than 220,000 migrants entered Europe illegally in 2014, compared to 60,000 in 2013, the European Commission says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There were more than 3,000 deaths of migrants at sea in 2014, and in 2015 there have already been more than 1,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Doing more and better to counter smuggling is a priority for the European Commission and it will also be one of the main pillars of the European Agenda on Migration that we will adopt in May this year," EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In a statement welcoming the JOT Mare initiative, he said Frontex was currently monitoring several non-EU ports and about a dozen large vessels in the Mediterranean, "which might be used for smuggling migrants".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Besides the UK, the following countries are involved in the new Europol unit: Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The scope of maritime patrols off Italian shores has been cut back since Italy ended its Mare Nostrum operation last November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It had focused on picking up migrants in distress after setting sail from Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The EU now runs a border control operation called Triton, limited to European territorial waters, with fewer ships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gerald Hesztera, a Europol spokesman, told the BBC that national police forces would send specialists to work at JOT Mare for a year or more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They would remain on the national payroll while engaged with the EU team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>JOT Mare's main job is to collect and analyse intelligence on people-smugglers, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We can co-ordinate and make the connections", to help national police operations, he said.</td></tr>
