<h3>Florida couple take milestone 100th cruise on Carnival Sensation</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Who wears those I Give Crew Hugs on the Carnival Sensation?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bernard and Janice Caffary are loyal -- loyal to the cruise ship the Carnival Sensation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The couple from Lakeland, Fla., are currently taking their 100th cruise on the ship as it sails from Florida to the Bahamas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Carnival Cruise Lines gave them a splashy sendoff Sunday at Port Canaveral to say thanks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>No one has reached the milestone of 100 cruises on the same ship in the cruise line's 43-year history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Janice and Bernard Caffary with cruise director Josh Waitzman, center, at the party on the Carnival Sensation held in their honor on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They were given the VIP treatment at the port with a banner to greet them and then partied on board with crew members of the 2,052-passenger Sensation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The crew members are phenomenal on this ship," Janice Caffary, 68, gushes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Everyone is more outgoing, always there to greet and hug you ... when we step on this ship, it's like coming back home."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Caffarys started their love affair with the Sensation in 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They most often reserve the same cabin (they won't say which one; it has an ocean view but no balcony) and they won't say how much they've spent on the cruises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>(Carnival estimates it's at least in the tens of thousands of dollars.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For Bernard Caffary, 76, a former submarine designer for General Dynamics, the journeys are about meeting crew members who represent 54 nationalities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"And they all have a story, they all work in peace and harmony," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He has even created an "I Give Crew Hugs" badge that he and his wife wear on cruises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In addition to the 100 cruises on the Sensation, the couple has racked up an additional 41 cruises with Carnival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They have 28 cruises planned for this year too, which roughs out to almost 200 days at sea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Janice Caffary says they have finished their bucket list of about 30 or 40 worldwide locations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Their favorite place: Cartagena, Colombia, which they loved for its architecture and culture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They've traveled so much that on their Carnival sailings over the years -- to the Bahamas, the western Caribbean, New Orleans -- that they frequently don't get off the ship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>You can find them on the Sensation in their favorite place, Joe's Cafe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They've become a bit of a sensation in their hometown too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Residents of Lakeland recognize them when they're shopping at the grocery story or at Walmart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Carnival offers a VIFP Club (Very Important Fun Person) loyalty program that rewards frequent cruisers with perks the more they sail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>(The Caffarys are at the top Diamond Level.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Among the goodies the Caffarys received Sunday: gifts, dinner with the captain and a framed Carnival flag signed by members of the crew.</td></tr>
