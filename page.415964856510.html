<h3>Barack Obama vows to stand 'hand in hand' with Kenya after massacre</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>US President Barack Obama called Kenya's leader and vowed to stand "hand-in-hand" with its government and people Friday, as they reel from an Islamist attack that killed 148 university students and security officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Words cannot adequately condemn the terrorist atrocities that took place at Garissa University College, where innocent men and women were brazenly and brutally massacred," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Somalia's Shebab Islamists have claimed responsibility for the attack, which was Kenya's deadliest since the 1998 bombing of the US embassy in Nairobi, and the bloodiest ever by the Al-Qaeda-affiliated militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Obama will make a long-awaited return to Kenya this July, visiting his father's homeland for the first time since becoming US president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I know firsthand the extraordinary resilience and fundamental decency of the people of Kenya. So I know that the people of Garissa and all of Kenya will grieve, but their determination to achieve a better and more secure future will not be deterred," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The future of Kenya will not be defined by violence and terror; it will be shaped by young people like those at Garissa University College," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This is a message I will relay to the Kenyan people when I visit Kenya in July."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Obama also called Kenyan leader Uhuru Kenyatta to offer his and the First Lady Michelle Obama's condolences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For much of Obama's time in power, Kenya's President Kenyatta had been under investigation by the International Criminal Court in The Hague.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kenyatta was indicted on five counts of crimes against humanity for his alleged role in 2007-08 post-election violence that killed an estimated 1,200 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 53-year-old son of Kenya's founding father protested his innocence until the case was withdrawn in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Obama said that "he looks forward to meeting with President Kenyatta again in Nairobi in July," the White House said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The two leaders will discuss how to strengthen counterterrorism cooperation and continue to work together to build a safer and more prosperous future for Kenya and the broader region."</td></tr>
