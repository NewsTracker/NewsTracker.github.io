<h3>Yahoo closing China office, cutting more than 200 jobs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a letter on Friday, Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>26, 2014, activist investor Jeffrey Smith urged Yahoo Inc. to buy another fallen Internet star, AOL Inc. and take steps to reduce the future taxes on the company's lucrative stake in China's Alibaba Group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yahoo Inc. is shutting down its office in China, a move that will eliminate 200 to 300 jobs, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The company, which has been consolidating offices and trimming staff around the world, told employees in Beijing that it will close the site, Yahoo said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Yahoo had about 12,500 workers worldwide at the end of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While the company didn't say how many would be affected in China, it employed 200 to 300 people there, said the person, who asked not to be named because the number isn't being disclosed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are constantly making changes to align resources, and to foster better collaboration and innovation across our business," Yahoo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We currently do not offer local product experiences in Beijing but the office has served as a research and development center."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Yahoo is looking for new ways to trim expenses as it comes under pressure from investors, such as Starboard Value LP, who have called for cost-saving measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer said in January that the company has focused on efficiency by keeping its employee numbers little changed even as it invested in products and made acquisitions that added staff at the Sunnyvale Web portal, whose revenue growth has stalled since 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"An R&D facility like this is a huge cost, and for a company as weak as Yahoo is now, it doesn't make sense," said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research in Shanghai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Yahoo doesn't have significance in China. Yahoo can't really recruit top people, and Chinese firms are not going to advertise on Yahoo."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The exit closes a chapter on Yahoo's sometimes difficult history in China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Executives came under criticism from human rights advocates and U.S. lawmakers after the company turned over information to the Chinese government on journalist Shi Tao, who was later sentenced to 10 years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Yahoo sold its Chinese operations to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Last month, Yahoo cut about 1 percent of its workforce, about 125 people, including editorial staff, in Canada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The company also closed its office in Amman, Jordan, and eliminated about 400 positions at its site in Bangalore, India, in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Yahoo shares have gained 13 percent in the past year, buoyed in part by the company's stake of about 15 percent in Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In January, Mayer unveiled plans for Yahoo to spin off its Alibaba holdings, which are valued at more than $32 billion.</td></tr>
