<h3>Hillary Clinton Goes Big On Immigration</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Democratic presidential candidate and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (L) speaks with student Betsaida Frausto at Rancho High School on May 5, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton vowed on Tuesday that she would not only support immigration reform and protect deportation relief policies put forward by President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>If elected president next year, she would expand them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"If Congress continues to refuse to act, as president I would do everything possible under the law to go even further," the 2016 Democratic candidate said at an event with young undocumented immigrants, held at Las Vegas' Rancho High School.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton's remarks, which essentially ran down the wish list of immigration activists, were more detailed than most expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She argued that she would lean in on immigration, and she used that as an attack on Republican presidential candidates who have backed away from the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On deportation relief, Clinton said she would do something that Obama hasn't: extend protections to the parents of Dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She said that other categories of undocumented immigrants should also be able to apply for such relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some Dreamers are able to remain in the U.S. and work temporarily under Obama's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In November executive actions, the president extended similar protections to more Dreamers and to the parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Those executive actions are currently blocked in the courts, but if they move forward, as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants could gain relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Millions more would remain without protections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Tuesday, Clinton defended Obama's actions against attacks by Republicans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"He had to act in the face of inaction that was not on the merits but politically motivated for partisan reasons," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Clinton said it was unrealistic to act as though all 11 million undocumented immigrants now in the U.S. could be deported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She said the idea was "beyond absurd. That's not going to happen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She also addressed less widely discussed immigration issues, arguing that those in deportation proceedings -- at the very least, the young -- should receive more legal representation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Clinton said she believes that undocumented immigrants who are children, who are particularly vulnerable such as transgender individuals, or who generally are not criminals should not be detained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She also criticized the congressional mandate that a certain number of detention beds be maintained and the fact that private prison companies run many immigrant detention facilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"People go out and round up people in order to get paid on a per-bed basis," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"That just makes no sense at all to me. That's not the way we should be running any detention facility."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Republican candidates have struggled with the issue of immigration in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Though it isn't typically the number one concern for Latinos in polls, it does tend to be more personal to those voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Republicans' statements against undocumented immigrants likely contributed to the GOP's poor performance among Latinos in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Clinton, on the other hand, has potential to do well among Latinos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>They favored her over Obama in the 2008 Democratic primaries, according to the Pew Research Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>And in the current campaign, she clearly views immigration as offering a positive contrast between herself and Republicans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>She said Tuesday that none of the GOP presidential candidates supports immigration reform the way she does.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R), in particular, previously called for a path to citizenship but have since backed focusing on border security first or permitting undocumented immigrants to attain legal status only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"When they talk about 'legal status,' that is code for second-class status," Clinton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Hillary Clinton supports immigration reform, but is that enough?</td></tr>
