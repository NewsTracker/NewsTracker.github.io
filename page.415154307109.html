<h3>Georgia woman trying to avoid execution for husband's murder</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Gissendaner's lawyers, on Monday, March 2, 2015, asked the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles to reconsider her request to have her sentence changed to life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gissendaner, 46, is set for execution at 7 p.m. (0200 GMT) at the state prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Gissendaner was convicted of murder in the February 1997 stabbing death of her husband.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>ATLANTA (AP) - With hours left before her execution Monday for her husband's murder, the only woman on Georgia's death row asked a state board to "bestow mercy" and appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court for a delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Earlier Monday, a federal appeals court in Atlanta rejected her lawyers' request to halt her execution on the grounds that Georgia's lethal injection procedures aren't transparent enough to allow a legal challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, is scheduled to receive an injection of pentobarbital at 7 p.m. Monday at the state prison in Jackson, for the February 1997 murder of her husband, Douglas Gissendaner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Prosecutors said she plotted his stabbing death with her boyfriend, Gregory Owen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Owen pleaded guilty and is serving a life sentence; his first possibility of parole will come in eight years, her lawyers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gissendaner would be the first woman executed in Georgia since 1945 and only the 16th woman put to death nationwide since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The parole board is the only entity in Georgia authorized to commute a death sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Gissendaner's lawyers note that the parole board already heard from many people testifying about Gissendaner's faith and remorse at a hearing last week before denying her clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But, her lawyers argue, the board did not hear from many Department of Corrections employees whose perspective "would have left no doubt that a grant of clemency is supported in this case."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The most important witness the board did not hear from is Kathy Seabolt, who served as her warden for six years, first at Metro State Prison and then at Lee Arrendale State Prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Seabolt could testify that former parole board chair James Donald promised Gissendaner would receive clemency, her lawyers wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Each time the topic came up in conversations between Donald and Seabolt, "Donald reiterated his statement that Ms. Gissendaner did not need to worry about clemency as it was a foregone conclusion," they wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the parole board to subpoena some other corrections employees so they can testify without fear of retaliation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Although department rules allow employees to speak to lawyers for capital clemency proceedings, the reality is less clear, Gissendaner's lawyers wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Some employees had said they would testify and provide written statements on Gissendaner's behalf, but changed their minds after getting a memo from the new warden, who succeeded Seabolt last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Under no circumstances are you to discuss this with people outside the institution. Staff should also be careful what is said to other inmates and personal feelings are to be suppressed," Kathleen Kennedy wrote on Jan. 29 as she notified staff of the likelihood of the upcoming execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the board to consider that before trial, she had been offered the same plea deal as Owen - life in prison with an agreement not to seek parole for 25 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"At one time, therefore, all the parties involved in the case thought a sentence less than death was appropriate for Ms. Gissendaner," her lawyers wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Owen, who is the one who stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death, took the deal and testified for the prosecution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Gissendaner balked at the parole agreement and took her lawyer's advice to go to trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The parole board has granted clemency before in cases involving disproportionate sentences for co-defendants, her lawyers wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"In fact, this Board has on at least four occasions in the past commuted a death sentence of a co-defendant who was not the actual killer of the victim," the lawyers wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Douglas Gissendaner's parents and sisters want her to be executed, but two of Kelly and Douglas' three children have asked the parole board to spare her life, the lawyers wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In statements submitted with her clemency application, Kayla and Dakota Gissendaner describe a journey from bitterness and anger to forgiveness; finally they have a meaningful relationship with their mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We also believe that Kelly's death will not restore them or make them whole," Gissendaner's lawyers wrote of the entire Gissendaner family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Gissendaner was originally set to be executed last Wednesday, but the Department of Corrections postponed it due to a winter weather report.</td></tr>

<h3>Georgia robbers using dating app ?Jack'd? to find victims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A pair of armed robbers in Rockdale County, Ga., scoured profiles on the gay dating and social network website Jack'd to find a man they later robbed at gunpoint, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A 23-year-old Conyers resident told the Rockdale County Sheriff's Office the alleged robbers reached out to him though a mysterious profile on the app on Feb. 22, Cpl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Michael Camp told the Daily News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"He started to get weird questions like 'who do you live with?' and 'are you home now?'" Camp said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"They were able to figure out where he lived, and that he was alone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A few hours later two black men in their 20s, dressed in dark clothing, drove a white Subaru with a loud exhaust to his property, Camp said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They rang the doorbell and when the victim answered the door, one suspect pulled a gun and forced the man to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As he held a gun to the victim's head, his accomplice entered the home and started taking items, Camp said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They stole nearly $5,000 worth of electronics, video games, jewelry and clothing, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The jewelry belonged to the victim's aunt who had passed away, a relative told TV station WSBTV in Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The victim was not injured, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The suspects drove off and police could not locate them by tracking the victim's cellphone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Camp said they are still trying to determine how they used the dating website to obtain the victim's address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Since the robbery, friends of the victim have also reported getting messages through Jack'd from the same mysterious profile, Camp said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Camp said they are working with the dating company to determine whether the victim revealed his location when he communicated with the profile.The robbers may have been able to figure out who he was or found his address through the wesbite or his phone, Camp said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Jack'd did not return a message seeking comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Police urged residents to be careful about giving away their address to anonymous people they meet online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>There have been many instances of people getting robbed or hurt after arranging to buy an item on Craigslist or other websites, Camp said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In January, an elderly Marietta, Ga., couple was murdered after they drove 180 miles because they thought they were buying a 1966 Mustang on Craigslist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"When you are talking to people you meet online you must be extremely cautious at first," Camp said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"If they are asking for personal information like your address, that should throw up a red flag."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In order to help in these types of situations, the sheriff's office announced on its Facebook page Friday that it would supply its offices as a safe meeting place for people to meet and conduct a transaction.</td></tr>
