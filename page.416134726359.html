<h3>Facebook responds to Belgian tracking allegations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"The researchers did find a bug that may have sent cookies (code stored in web browsers) to some people when they weren't on Facebook," Allen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"This was not our intention. A fix for this is already underway."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Belgium is among EU countries investigating Facebook's privacy practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A proposed EU law would fine companies up to five percent of their annual revenue or 100 million Euros ($101.5 million) for violating personal data regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Researchers said Facebook gave users a "false sense of control" over their information, and were denied a "meaningful choice" in deciding how their data was collected and used for advertising purposes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Facebook responded by disputing researchers' definition of "tracking," and added it is transparent about its use of cookies while delivering messages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Facebook does receive standard 'web impressions', or website visit information, when people visit sites with our plugins or other integrations. The authors misleadingly call this 'tracking.' Unlike many companies, we explain how we will use this information and the controls we honor and offer," said Allen.</td></tr>
