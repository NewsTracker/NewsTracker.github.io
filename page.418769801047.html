<h3>FIFA says corruption crisis hinders search for new sponsors</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) " The FIFA corruption crisis is hurting its search for new World Cup sponsors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Targeting almost $6 billion in revenue from the 2018 tournament, FIFA has not signed any new sponsors since last year's World Cup in Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Definitely the current situation does not help to finalize any new agreement. That is a fact," FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said Friday ahead of this weekend's qualifying draw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The first big event for host Russia has brought hundreds of international media to St. Petersburg, offering a natural stage for a sponsorship launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, Valcke said no major deals would be completed until FIFA's future is clearer " after Sepp Blatter is replaced as president next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I'm sure until the (presidential) election, until the 26th of February, there will not be major announcements," Valcke said, adding that "at least two major companies" have been in negotiatons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Amid growing frustration with FIFA since May 27, when American and Swiss federal investigations of alleged bribery and money-laundering were revealed, current sponsors have asked to meet with FIFA management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>FIFA received a letter from sponsors this week and will organize a briefing in August by its lawyers and marketing officials, Valcke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Valcke spoke at a news conference hours after Visa said FIFA's responses to the recent crisis were "wholly inadequate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We believe no meaningful progress can be made under FIFA's existing leadership," the United States-based credit card company said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Long-time FIFA backer Coca-Cola and second-tier sponsor McDonald's have also broken ranks from their traditional loyalty by criticizing the football body's handling of bribery allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Blatter and Valcke are expected targets in the U.S. Department of Justice's case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>FIFA's slate of current World Cup sponsors is looking thin as its seeks to fill 34 available slots for two-tournament packages taking in the 2018 event in Russia and the 2022 tournament in Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Two top-tier sponsors, Dubai-based airline Emirates and Sony, were among several commercial partners who did not renew last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Only seven of 14 available positions in FIFA's top two commercial categories have been filled, and none of the 20 slots in a new regional category designed to increase revenue from the 2010-2014 tournament cycle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>FIFA earned $1.63 billion in marketing revenue tied to the 2014 tournament in Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Its total "event-related revenue" in that four-year commercial period was more than $5.1 billion, the governing body's accounts showed in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Valcke said the 2018 tournament should be worth more and insisted FIFA was not behind schedule in signing deals to meet its revenue targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"No, it's not too late as long as we are doing it in the early part of 2016," the French official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>With some sponsors committed to other big events in 2016 " such as the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and the European Championship " promotional campaigns tied to the 2018 World Cup would typically start after they are finished, Valcke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Blatter's right-hand man since 2007 is unlikely to clinch the new contracts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>FIFA rules require the president to propose appointing a secretary general and a new leader elected in February will want to choose his own person, Valcke said.</td></tr>
