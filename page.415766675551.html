<h3>No ill feelings toward Ferguson: Raiders</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Canberra skipper Jarrod Croker says there will be no hard feelings when he marks up on Sydney Roosters centre Blake Ferguson in the NRL match at Allianz Stadium on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ferguson spectacularly went AWOL from the Raiders in 2013 after a string of off-field indiscretions, leaving the club no choice but to sack the rising star just after he had played in a NSW State of Origin side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ferguson will face his old club for the first time after starring in the Roosters' win over Penrith, yet Croker says he doesn't hold any grudges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Blake's put it behind him and we've put it behind us. It's good to see Fergo back where he belongs - on the football field," Croker said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He's going to be a handful, but I'm confident we're going to be able to do a job on him."</td></tr>
