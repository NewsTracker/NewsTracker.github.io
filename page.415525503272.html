<h3>Fin24.com | Apple in talks over TV service, report says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple Mac.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>New York - Apple is in talks with US television networks to offer around 25 channels across any iOS device as soon as September, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The company has been in discussions with CBS, 21st Century Fox and Disney (owner of ABC) among other networks, as it attempts to put together a bundle of popular channels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Unlike cable bundles, which offer a long list of smaller networks, the California-based tech giant is aiming to assemble a "skinny" bundle of heavy-hitters, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However NBCUniversal, which owns channels such as NBC, USA and Bravo, is not part of the discussions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company was struck from the list after previous talks about a streaming television platform with NBC parent company Comcast ended in a fallout, the Journal said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a separate deal, HBO has already partnered with Apple to provide a standalone online TV service that will launch in April on Apple's streaming media player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The talks come as television channels and cable operators fear losing viewership to "cord cutters" who drop costly cable subscriptions and rely on online streaming, picking and choosing shows a la carte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The deal with Apple would allow networks to retain viewers, albeit on alternate platforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The approximately 25 channels would be available on all iOS operating system devices such as iPhones, iPads and Apple TV boxes.</td></tr>
