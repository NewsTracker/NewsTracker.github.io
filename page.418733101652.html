<h3>Suruc suicide bomber identified as Turk with possible Islamic State ties</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hundreds protest a deadly bombing in Turkey by Islamic State militants that left more than 30 people dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Istanbul: The suicide bomber who killed at least 32 people at a cultural centre in southeast Turkey has been identified as a Turkish citizen who was believed to have had ties to the Islamic State militant group, a senior government official said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The bomber, Seyh Abdurrahman Alagoz, a 20-year-old university student who had recently returned from Syria, was identified through DNA testing, according to reports in the Turkish news media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The investigation is ongoing, but we have evidence that the suspect was linked to Daesh," the official said, speaking on a condition of anonymity in line with government protocol, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The government was criticised after the attack, and access to Twitter was temporarily blocked on Wednesday after a court imposed a ban on the circulation of images and videos from Monday's suicide bombing in the town of Suruc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The service was restored a few hours later, after Twitter took down the images.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The bomber struck the Amara Cultural Centre in Suruc as a group of young activists gathered in the garden to discuss rebuilding the predominantly Kurdish town of Kobane, just across the nearby border with Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kobane was recently the scene of fierce fighting between the Islamic State and Kurdish fighters, and the militants lost control of the town in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some members of the opposition in Turkey have accused government leaders of failing to take sufficient measures to curb the rise of the Islamic State in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Demonstrators took to the streets of Istanbul on Monday, with some accusing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of collaborating with the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Others charged that the focus of the governing Justice and Development Party, or AKP, on toppling President Bashar Assad of Syria facilitated the growth of Islamist militants in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu vehemently denied the accusations and vowed to increase security measures along the 800-km border between Syria and Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Turkey and the AKP government have never had any direct or indirect links with any terrorist group and have never showed tolerance to any terrorist group."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Davutoglu said after visiting people wounded in the Suruc attack on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He warned that Turkish security could be compromised by a spillover from the war in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Separately, two police officers were shot and killed in their homes in the border town of Ceylanpinar on Wednesday, the district governor said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Responsibility for the attack was claimed by a military organisation affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, a Kurdish separatist group that is in a fragile peace process with the Turkish government after a 30-year conflict that claimed over 40,000 lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The group, the People's Defence Forces., said on its website that the attack was in retaliation for "the massacre in Suruc".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It also accused the police of cooperating with jihadis.</td></tr>
