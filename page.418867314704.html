<h3>AP source: Rockies trade SS Troy Tulowitzki to Blue Jays (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DENVER (AP) -- Troy Tulowitzki has been traded by the Colorado Rockies to the Toronto Blue Jays for Jose Reyes and three pitching prospects in a stunning swap of star shortstops, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity early Tuesday because the deal had not yet been announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In addition to Tulowitzki, the Rockies sent 42-year-old reliever LaTroy Hawkins to the Blue Jays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Along with Reyes, the Rockies picked up reliever Miguel Castro and two minor league pitchers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Neither team had confirmed the blockbuster deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>FoxSports.com first reported the sides had agreed to a trade involving Tulowitzki, Reyes and minor leaguers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The talented but oft-injured Tulowitzki is a five-time All-Star who is hitting .300 with 12 homers and 53 RBIs in 87 games this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He was replaced on defense in the bottom of the ninth inning during Colorado's 9-8 loss to the Cubs in Chicago on Monday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After the game, the slugger spent at least 30 minutes in manager Walt Weiss' office at Wrigley Field, but was unavailable to reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The deal gives Toronto another powerful, right-handed bat in a dangerous lineup that includes Jose Bautista, Josh Donaldson, Edwin Encarnacion and Russell Martin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Blue Jays are tied for second place in the AL East, seven games behind the New York Yankees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Reyes is batting .285 with four homers, 34 RBIs and 16 steals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He was acquired by Toronto in a November 2012 trade with Miami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The face of Colorado's franchise, the 30-year-old Tulowitzki has spent his entire career with the Rockies (42-55) but has been the subject of trade speculation for some time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Still, the Blue Jays seemed an unlikely destination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Tulowitzki is in the middle of a $118 million, six-year contract that runs through 2020.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The deal includes a $15 million team option for 2021 with a $4 million buyout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Before the game, Weiss was asked if he's talked to his star shortstop about handling distractions leading up to Friday's non-waiver trade deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''I've talked to these guys as a group about all the distractions that come with the trade deadline,'' Weiss said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''Basically, I told them to control what they can control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The speedy Reyes, a four-time All-Star with the New York Mets, has struggled with injuries throughout his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In 69 games with the Blue Jays this season, he is hitting .285 with a .322 on-base percentage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He has four home runs, 34 RBIs and 16 stolen bases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Reyes is signed through 2017 on a $106 million, six-year contract.</td></tr>
