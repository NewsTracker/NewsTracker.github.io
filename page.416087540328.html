<h3>Tsarnaev guilty on all charges in Boston Marathon bombing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tsarnaev was convicted on multiple charges in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when twin pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the finish line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>BOSTON (AP) - Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on all charges Wednesday in the Boston Marathon bombing by a jury that will now decide whether the 21-year-old should be executed or shown mercy for what his lawyer says was a crime masterminded by his big brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The former college student folded his arms, fidgeted and looked down at the defense table in federal court as he listened to one guilty verdict after another on all 30 counts against him, including conspiracy and deadly use of a weapon of mass destruction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Seventeen of those counts are punishable by death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The verdict, reached after a day and a half of deliberations, was practically a foregone conclusion, given his lawyer's startling admission at the trial's outset that Tsarnaev carried out the terror attack with his now-dead older brother, Tamerlan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line on April 15, 2013, killed three spectators and wounded more than 260 other people, turning the traditionally celebratory home stretch of the world-famous race into a scene of carnage and putting the city on edge for days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tsarnaev was found responsible not only for those deaths but for the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer who was gunned down days later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Guilty like we all knew he would be. Great jurors," said Sydney Corcoran, who nearly bled to death after shrapnel severed a major artery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Karen Brassard, who suffered wounds on her legs, said: "It's not a happy occasion, but it's something. ... One more step behind us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She said Tsarnaev appeared "arrogant" and uninterested during the trial, and she wasn't surprised when she saw no remorse on his face as the verdicts were read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She refused to say whether she believes he deserves the death penalty, but she rejected the defense argument that he was simply following his brother's lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"He was in college. He was a grown man who knew what the consequences would be," Brassard said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I believe he was 'all in' with the brother."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers left the courthouse without commenting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In the trial's next phase, which could begin as early as Monday, the jury will hear evidence on whether he should get the death penalty or spend the rest of his life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In a bid to save him from a death sentence, defense attorney Judy Clarke has argued that Tsarnaev fell under the influence of his radicalized brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She repeatedly referred to Dzhokhar - then 19 - as a "kid" and a "teenager."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened," she told the jury during closing arguments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Prosecutors, however, portrayed the brothers - ethnic Chechens who moved to the United States from Russia more than a decade ago - as full partners in a brutal and coldblooded plan to punish the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Jihadist writings, lectures and videos were found on both their computers, though the defense argued that Tamerlan downloaded the material and sent it to his brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Tamerlan, 26, died when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt days after the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The government called 92 witnesses over 15 days, painting a hellish scene of torn-off limbs, blood-spattered pavement, ghastly screams and the smell of sulfur and burned hair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Survivors gave heartbreaking testimony about losing legs in the blasts or watching people die.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The father of 8-year-old Martin Richard described making the agonizing decision to leave his mortally wounded son so he could get help for their 6-year-old daughter, whose leg had been blown off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In the courtroom Wednesday, Denise Richard, the boy's mother, wiped tears from her face after the verdict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The boy's father, Bill Richard, embraced one of the prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In Russia, Tsarnaev's father, Anzor Tsarnaev, told The Associated Press in recent days that he would have no comment.</td></tr>
