<h3>Thunder match Portland's offer sheet, will keep Kanter (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The Thunder will keep Enes Kanter after matching an offer sheet by the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Oklahoma City acquired the center in a trade with the Utah Jazz last season, and he helped the Thunder while Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka battled injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He averaged 13.8 points and 7.8 rebounds for Utah, but those numbers ballooned to 18.7 points and 11.0 rebounds with the Thunder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kanter entered the offseason as a restricted free agent, and a person with knowledge of the details told The Associated Press that he signed a four-year, $70 million offer sheet with Portland last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Thunder said all along they wanted to keep the 23-year-old Kanter, who scored 20 or more points in 12 of his 26 appearances with the Thunder last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''We traded for Enes last season with the intention of keeping him as a member of the Thunder for several years to come, and we are excited that he will continue with us,'' Thunder general manager Sam Presti said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kanter is a skilled low-post scorer who adds versatility to an offense that features Durant, Ibaka and reigning scoring champion Russell Westbrook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>After the midseason deal with Utah, Kanter proved to instantly have a good rapport with Westbrook, especially on the pick-and-roll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Kanter made it clear during the season that he was much happier in Oklahoma City, and that he considered the Thunder a first-class organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Kanter, the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>3 pick in the 2011 draft, will need to improve defensively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The move could be attractive to Durant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 2014 MVP is entering the final year of his contract after playing just 27 games last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Thunder appear to be all in on trying to get him a title before he has to make a final decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Oklahoma City is well over the salary cap and will pay the luxury tax, a change of direction for the typically cost-conscious franchise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But the league recently had a 10.3 percent increase in the luxury tax number, to $84.7 million, and that number will climb higher the following year when the league's new television deals take effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Oklahoma City already had shaken things up by firing coach Scott Brooks and replacing him with Florida's Billy Donovan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Now, it appears the Thunder will be in position to compete in an improving West that features defending champion Golden State and an improved San Antonio squad that signed LaMarcus Aldridge.</td></tr>
