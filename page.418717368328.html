<tr><td>3</td><td>Stocks will look to corporate earnings on both sides of the Atlantic for direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Meanwhile, the Greek parliament will vote on reforms it must undertake for talks on a multi-billion euro bailout to start this week, which will help determine broader sentiment in Europe.</td></tr>
