<h3>Archer ties Rays record with 15 Ks in 6-1 win over Angels (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ANAHEIM, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(AP) -- Chris Archer was in the zone in more ways than one, toying with the Los Angeles Angels' hitters with his fastball and slider to a point where they didn't know what to swing at.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And when they did, they usually missed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Archer tied a franchise record with 15 strikeouts over eight innings, overcoming another milestone home run by Albert Pujols and leading the Rays to a 6-1 victory Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He didn't realize what he had done until teammate Evan Longoria approached him after he had been taken out of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''I had no clue,'' the 26-year-old right-hander said of his strikeout total.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''Longo told me after I finished the eighth: 'Congrats on tying the franchise record.' I knew that I struck out quite a few people, but my focus was 60 feet, 6 inches away each individual pitch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Archer (6-4) matched the 15 strikeouts James Shields had on Oct. 2, 2012 in a complete-game 1-0 loss to Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He did not walk a batter, throwing 80 of his 105 pitches for strikes and allowing six hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''Getting people out in the big leagues, whether it's a strikeout, popup, ground ball, a missile to the shortstop, it all feels the same,'' said Archer, who fanned reigning AL MVP Mike Trout three times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''If you're out there counting strikeouts, either you're really desperate for them or you're just so out-of-this-planet good that the game is easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I was in the moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''It all stems from fastball command,'' he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''They take bad swings at the slider because you're in the zone with the heater so much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Archer won his third straight decision, becoming the first Ray with at least 12 strikeouts in consecutive outings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Last Wednesday, he pitched eight innings of two-hit ball in his duel with Seattle's Felix Hernandez and wound up with a no-decision in Tampa Bay's 3-0 loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Archer struck out the side on 12 pitches in the second inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He fanned his first two in the third before Johnny Giavotella singled off the pitcher's leg and continued to second when Jake Elmore - making his third career start at first base - dropped the throw from third baseman Longoria on the ricochet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Archer overcame Elmore's error by striking out Erick Aybar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''He was exceptional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He's definitely one of the best pitchers in the game,'' Angels catcher Chris Iannetta said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''He throws a mid-90s fastball that can touch 97 and 98 on some of his good days, and his slider speaks for itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Pujols tied Jimmie Foxx for 17th place on the career home run list with his 534th, putting him two behind Mickey Mantle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>And he did it in his 8,134th big league at-bat - the exact same number that Foxx finished his career with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Pujols' solo shot in the fourth inning was his sixth homer in as many games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It also was the 1,118th extra-base hit for the three-time NL MVP, edging him past Foxx and Ted Williams into sole possession of 16th place in that department and putting him within one of George Brett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>C.J. Wilson (3-4) gave up five runs, four hits and three walks in six innings and struck out seven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The left-hander, coming off a 12-2 win over Detroit last Thursday, hasn't won consecutive starts since last September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Logan Forsythe opened the scoring in the first, driving a 1-0 pitch into the lower seats in the left field corner with two outs after a single by Joey Butler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Forsythe has hit exactly six home runs in each of his last four seasons, none with more than one man on base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The Rays did not get another hit until the sixth, when Elmore drove in two runs with a bases-loaded single after Wilson plunked Brandon Guyer to open the inning and issued two two-out walks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Cabrera capped the rally with an RBI single that increased Tampa Bay's lead to 5-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Rays: RHP Kirby Yates, sidelined because of a strained right pectoral muscle, is expected to pitch one inning in a rehab outing with Single-A Charlotte on Thursday after throwing an inning in an expended string training game on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>... LHP Matt Moore is on tap to throw 50 pitches Wednesday for Charlotte in a rehab game while recovering from Tommy John surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Rays: Rookie RHP Nathan Karns (3-2) pitched six innings of one-hit ball last Friday at Baltimore and left with a 1-0 lead, but had to settle for a no-decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Angels: LHP Hector Santiago (4-3) is 2-0 in his last five starts at home, allowing three earned runs in 31 innings.</td></tr>
