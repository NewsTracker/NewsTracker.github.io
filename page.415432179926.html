<h3>Energy agency sees more oil declines, potential for conflict</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Oil prices have further to drop with no signs of slowing production in the U.S., according to the International Energy Agency, Friday, March 13, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Oil prices have further to drop with few signs of slowing production in the U.S., according to a global energy agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The International Energy Agency, a watchdog group based in Paris that represents the world's main oil-importing nations, said in its monthly report Friday that the recent stabilization in oil prices is "precarious."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Behind the facade of stability, the rebalancing triggered by the price collapse has yet to run its course," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That may be playing out right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Oil prices tumbled 10 percent this week, including a 5 percent drop Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The IEA cautioned that risks of oil supply disruptions are growing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Low prices could raise the risk of social disruption in some countries dependent on oil, the agency said, and the ongoing conflict in Iraq and Libya hasn't slowed down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Drillers are cutting back on spending and taking production offline because of plunging prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Friday, oilfield services company Baker Hughes said that the number of rigs exploring for oil and natural gas in the U.S. fell by another 67 this week to 1,125.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>More than half the rigs taken off line were in Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That hasn't stemmed the glut of oil that is now nearing full capacity at U.S. storage sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The U.S. supply of oil has reached levels not seen in at least 80 years, according to the Energy Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The growth in stored oil might be slowed this spring as refineries idled for maintenance start production again, but it won't stop it, according to the IEA report Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That is setting oil and gasoline prices up for another steep fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The price of oil fell $2.21 Friday to close at $44.84 per barrel in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Prices were more than double that at this time last year.</td></tr>
