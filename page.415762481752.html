<h3>Mexico double-transplant patient eyes US humanitarian entry</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Family and friends raised thousands of dollars to send Jose Chua Lopez to the prestigious Mayo Clinic for an urgently needed heart and liver transplant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But the 20-year-old Mexican born with a heart defect has twice been turned down for a U.S. visa, and relatives and his doctor say his life is in danger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - A young Mexican man who is urgently trying to travel to the Mayo Clinic for a double-organ transplant has filed a third application for entry into the United States after twice being denied a visa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The U.S. Department of State has not explained why, citing visa applications as confidential.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Chua was born with only one ventricle in his heart, causing circulation problems that mean blood reaches only one of the four chambers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His liver has also been damaged and he needs a heart and liver double-transplant, a procedure that is not performed in his home country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Family and friends raised more than $15,000 to defray the initial costs of his treatment at the prestigious Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kevin Forbes, director of the U.S.-based Consejo de Latinos Unidos, which helps uninsured people get access to medical care, said the new application has been expedited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He added that once Chua is allowed to enter the U.S., the group plans to press a formal complaint with the U.S. government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The problem goes beyond Jose. ... The situation has become complicated and raises doubts as to the motives of why a consulate would deny a visa on two occasions and did not directly offer a humanitarian visa," Forbes said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The State Department lists medical need as one reason for granting tourism visas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Chua's mother, Mayra Lopez, said she believed he was denied the visa due to concerns about his ability to support himself financially for the trip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The family is now seeking a humanitarian parole from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Chua, whose father is an Arizona resident, had a U.S. visa until he was 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But when it expired, his family didn't renew it because they didn't have money to pay for more trips.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In correspondence shared by Forbes with The Associated Press, he expressed exasperation at feeling like he was being given the run-around by U.S. officials in his attempts to help Chua.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>One email referred him to a State Department webpage and an automated customer service phone number, a response he called "an absolute abomination."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Officials, including in the State Department, should defend those who seek help, not become apologists for outdated policies and processes," Forbes said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Chua underwent three open-heart surgeries between the ages of 5 months and 12 years, including a cardiac implant that stopped working properly in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The surgery itself could end up costing around $2 million, Chua's family says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Chua, who dreams of becoming a doctor despite his delicate health, said Wednesday that his "world has fallen down" over the visa denials.</td></tr>
