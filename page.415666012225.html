<h3>Netanyahu, Obama rift ratchets up the rhetoric on all sides</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Benjamin Netanyahu's allies acknowledged on Sunday that his election-eve disavowal of a Palestinian state had caused a rift with the White House, but blamed U.S. President Barack Obama's unprecedented criticism on a misunderstanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr. Obama's public condemnation of Mr. Netanyahu came in an interview with The Huffington Post released on the weekend in which the U.S. President said the Israeli leader's remarks in the closing days of his re-election campaign had upended the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and ran counter to the very nature of Israeli democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I indicated to him that given his statements prior to the election, it is going to be hard to find a path where people are seriously believing that negotiations are possible," Mr. Obama said in the interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ignoring Mr. Netanyahu's attempt in postelection interviews to walk back his comments, Mr. Obama made clear - as have senior members of his administration in recent days - that he believes Mr. Netanyahu is opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the United States, where relations with Mr. Netanyahu have become a partisan issue after generations in which support for Israel was a point of bipartisan unity, Republican Senator John McCain said Mr. Obama should get over his "temper tantrum."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Israeli Prime Minister pledged on the eve of his re-election victory last week that there would never be a Palestinian state while he is prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The remarks were widely interpreted as a rejection of the "two-state solution" that has been the basis of decades of talks to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, brokered by successive U.S. Republican and Democratic administrations alike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Since winning re-election, Mr. Netanyahu has tried to row back, arguing that he was not rejecting Palestinian statehood in principle, but responding to a reality in which the Palestinian Authority has a political pact with the Islamist group Hamas, under which statehood would be unacceptable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr. Obama told Mr. Netanyahu on Thursday that Washington would have to "reassess" its policies in the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In Ottawa, Stephen Harper's office released a statement on Sunday saying the Prime Minister reiterated Canada's support for a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians during a phone call with Mr. Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was the first time the two leaders have spoken since Mr. Netanyahu secured a victory on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr. Harper congratulated his counterpart for the re-election, his office said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Israel's Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz, a close Netanyahu ally, acknowledged the problem but pointed the finger at Washington for failing to understand the Prime Minister's position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"If the Americans are finding it difficult to understand or accept our clarifications [on Palestinian statehood], this is certainly worrying and requires tending to," he told Israel Radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"He [Mr. Netanyahu] didn't say this [statehood] is 'unacceptable.' He said reality has changed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr. Steinitz also said that the main reason for tensions with Washington was "the strong disagreement we have with the United States over the Iran issue."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We cannot accept the idea that the whole world - the Iranians, the Europeans, the Americans - are talking about the nuclear agreement with Iran and we have to sit quietly on the side," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Israel's close alliance with the United States has been a fundamental pillar of its security throughout its 67-year history, and Mr. Netanyahu's political foes have accused him of jeopardizing it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr. Netanyahu has long had a difficult relationship with Mr. Obama, and made it worse two weeks before the election by addressing the U.S. Congress at the invitation of opposition Republicans to condemn the administration's nuclear negotiations with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Asked if U.S.-Israel relations were at a dangerous point, Mr. McCain, a leading voice on foreign affairs in the Republican-controlled Congress, said: "I think that's up to the president of the United States."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Get over your temper tantrum, Mr. President," Mr. McCain said on CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The least of your problems is what Bibi Netanyahu said during an election campaign. If every politician were held to everything they say in a political campaign, obviously that would be a topic of long discussion."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Amos Yadlin, a former chief of Israeli military intelligence aligned with the centre-left Zionist Union which lost the vote to Mr. Netanyahu, said Israel would "pay a price" for Mr. Netanyahu's remarks on statehood, which had caused "fury" in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I'm not among those who panic: I don't think the United States will impose sanctions on Israel. But I see places in which it will go much harder for us," said Mr. Yadlin, who returned a day earlier from a visit to the U.S. capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Firstly, they used a word that they haven't used since 1975 - 'reassessment,' a reassessment of relations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Israeli President Reuven Rivlin began the formal process on Sunday of consulting political parties to nominate a candidate to form a governing coalition, largely a foregone conclusion after Mr. Netanyahu's victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mr. Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud party, is likely to be given the nod as early as Wednesday to start what could be up to 42 days of negotiations with potential cabinet partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He is expected to build a coalition with far-right, religious and centrist parties, on course to becoming Israel's longest-serving prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>His comments on a Palestinian state were part of a hard rightward tack that helped deliver the election victory after polls predicted he would lose to the centre-left Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Mr. Obama also took Mr. Netanyahu to task for an Internet post on the day of the election in which the Prime Minister urged right-wing supporters to vote because Arab Israelis were doing so in large numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mr. Netanyahu publicly embraced an independent state for Palestinians in a speech in 2009, but Palestinians have long questioned his sincerity, noting his expansion of Israeli settlements on occupied land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas called Mr. Netanyahu's latest comments "very worrying."</td></tr>
