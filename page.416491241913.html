<h3>Court: Family of teen shot across border can't sue US agent</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A U.S. Border Patrol agent who killed a teenager when he fired across the border from Texas into Mexico cannot be sued in U.S. courts by the Mexican teen's family, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The unanimous ruling was issued by the full 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and reverses most of an earlier 2-1 ruling by a three-judge panel of the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An attorney for the teen's family said they haven't decided whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We leave for others to decide whether this Court has lost its moral bearings," attorney Marion Reilly said in a written statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"On behalf of the parents of an innocent slain teenager - a human being, regardless of his nationality - we simply note that they and we had not expected such a decision from a court of the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There's no dispute that the U.S. Border Patrol agent, Jesus Mesa Jr., shot 15-year-old Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca in June 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At issue is whether the teen's family could sue him in U.S. courts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>With support from the Mexican government, the teen's parents argued that they should be allowed to sue in the U.S. court system because Mesa's actions all occurred on American soil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the 5th Circuit ruled that, among other things, Mesa was entitled to immunity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mesa's attorney, Randolph Ortega, said Friday that "we're very happy" with the ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Noting that the 5th Circuit's ruling was unanimous, Ortega said he doubted the U.S. Supreme Court would take up the case if Hernandez's parents pursued an appel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mesa has said he shot the teen while being attacked by rock throwers as he tried to arrest immigrants who crossed illegally into the U.S. The shooting occurred near a bridge between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua.</td></tr>
