<h3>Justice Dept. opens Baltimore police probe; 1K protest</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Justice Department said Tuesday it has opened a civil rights investigation into the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who suffered a fatal spinal-cord injury under mysterious circumstances after he was handcuffed and put in the back of a police van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After the probe was announced, at least 1,000 people gathered at a previously planned rally at the site of Gray's arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Protesters marched to a police station a couple of blocks away, chanting and holding signs that read "Black Lives Matter" and "No Justice, No Peace" - slogans that have come to embody what demonstrators believe is widespread mistreatment of blacks by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Pricilla Jackson carried a sign reading, "Convict Freddie's killers," that listed the names of the six officers suspended with pay while local authorities and the U.S. Justice Department investigate the death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jackson, who is black, said she wants Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake to know that she and others have been brutalized by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>At least one activist was detained when he jumped past police barriers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gray's mother, Gloria Darden, was overcome with grief and carried away at one point by several men, writhing and sobbing uncontrollably, her face obscured by a hood and dark glasses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The crowd parted to let her through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Another female family member collapsed in tears and was also helped away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As the sun fell, some protesters lit candles and the demonstration peacefully dispersed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>More protests were planned for later in the week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gray, 25, was taken into custody April 12 after police "made eye contact" with him and another man in an area known for drug activity, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Gray was handcuffed and put in a transport van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>At some point during his roughly 30-minute ride, the van was stopped and Gray's legs were shackled when an officer felt he was becoming "irate," police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said that Gray asked for an inhaler, and then several times asked for medical care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He was eventually rushed to a hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Gray died Sunday - a week after his arrest - of what police described as "a significant spinal injury."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Exactly how he was injured and what happened in the van is not known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said investigators are "gathering information to determine whether any prosecutable civil rights violation occurred."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It's not uncommon for federal investigators to look into allegations of excessive police force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Justice Department investigations in the last year include probes into the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri - a case that resulted in no charges against the officer - and an ongoing review of a police chokehold death of a New York City man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>There's a high threshold for bringing federal civil rights charges against police officers in such cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Federal investigators must show an officer willfully deprived a person of his or her civil rights by using more force than the law allows, a standard that's challenging in rapidly unfolding confrontations in which snap judgments are made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The mayor said she welcomed the Justice Department probe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Whenever a police force conducts an internal investigation, there are always appropriate questions of transparency and impartiality," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"My goal has always been to get answers to the questions so many of us are still asking with regards to Mr. Gray's death."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In the Baltimore case, the six suspended officers have been on the force anywhere from three years to 18 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>According to court documents, Officer Garrett Miller accused Gray of carrying a switchblade, which was discovered in Gray's pocket after he was stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>- Lt. Brian Rice, 41, with the department since 1997.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>- Sgt. Alicia White, 30, with the department since 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>- Officer Caesar Goodson, 45, who has been there since 1999.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>- Officers William Porter and Edward Nero, who along with Miller, all joined in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Kim Deachilla, a spokeswoman for the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3, said a law firm that contracts with the union is representing them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The officers' specific roles in the arrest were not released by city officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Bystander video of the arrest shows officers on bicycles, in patrol cars and outside the transport van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The lawyer for Gray's family said he believes the police had no reason to stop him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"Running while black is not probable cause. Felony running doesn't exist, and you can't arrest someone for looking you in the eye," attorney Billy Murphy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Batts said the reason for Gray's stop is "a question we have to dig into."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Harold Perry, 73, a retired small businessman who is nearly blind, said he heard the arrest through his bedroom window.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>A young man was screaming "You're hurting me! Get your knee off my back," Perry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>In the bystander video, Gray is screaming, but it's not clear what he is saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>At a news conference Monday, officials vowed transparency and pledged to hold those found responsible accountable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Batts said the investigation will be completed by May 1 and the results will be sent to the state attorney's office to determine whether criminal charges will be filed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Batts also said he is ordering that police review and rewrite "effective immediately" its policies on moving prisoners and providing them with medical attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>William Stewart, a friend of Freddie Gray, protests outside City Hall in Baltimore, Monday, April 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Baltimore's top police officials, mayor and prosecutor sought to calm a "community on edge" Monday while investigating how Gray suffered a fatal spine injury while under arrest.</td></tr>
