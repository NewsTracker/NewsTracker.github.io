<h3>Sources: Justice asked to consider probing Clinton emails</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal officials say two government inspectors general have asked the Justice Department to determine whether sensitive government information was transmitted on Hillary Rodham Clinton's personal email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Clinton has acknowledged her use of a personal email server as secretary of state but had said she never sent classified information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The New York Times first reported the referral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Clinton campaign said Friday that she "followed appropriate practices in dealing with classified materials."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Spokesman Nick Merrill said emails deemed classified by the administration were done so after the fact, not when they were sent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One U.S. official said it was unclear whether classified information was mishandled and the referral doesn't suggest wrongdoing by Clinton herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The officials were not authorized to discuss the referral by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
