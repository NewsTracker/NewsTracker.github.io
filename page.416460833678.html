<h3>Letters signal Bali Nine execution close</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australian embassy officials will on Saturday be given notice of Indonesia's plans to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, but not the date, the attorney-general's spokesman says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tony Spontana told reporters the date hadn't been decided because there was no decision yet on an application for a judicial review for an Indonesian prisoner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It depends on the Zainal Abidin decision," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Indonesia is required to give at least 72 hours' notice of the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Spontana said the Saturday meeting of all foreign embassies concerned - Australia, Brazil, Nigeria, France and the Philippines - signalled the start of the execution process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A prisoner listed as being from Ghana, Martin Anderson, was actually Nigerian, Mr Spontana said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It can be three days, it can be more," he said of the notice period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We're only telling them that they are entering the stages of execution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Families and consular staff will get as much chance as possible to see the prisoners before execution, Mr Spontana said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Certainly, until the time comes when they're only guarded by prison officers, doctors and psychiatrists," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The spokesman couldn't confirm which prisoners had been moved into isolation conditions, except for Mary Jane Veloso from the Philippines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Veloso was moved to Nusakambangan before dawn on Friday and was in isolation in one of the island's prisons, Mr Spontana said, because it had no special facility for women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For this reason, her transfer from a prison near Jogjakarta was delayed for as long as possible before the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Her two sons, aged six and 12, have arrived in Indonesia and had expected to visit her on Friday afternoon.</td></tr>
