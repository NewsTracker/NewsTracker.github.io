<h3>SA govt backs audit of Islamic schools</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The South Australian government has backed an audit of Islamic schools around Australia, including one in Adelaide where parents have protested against alleged mismanagement and falling standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The move comes as the board chairman of the Islamic College of South Australia hit back at criticism, describing claims he had a "hit list" of staff he wanted sacked as "pure fantasy" and defending the board's handling of college finances and other issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The federal education department will scrutinise all six schools run by the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils to investigate concerns relating to their financial management and governance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Education Minister Christopher Pyne said he was concerned with allegations reported in the media in relation to curriculum, gender segregation, senior staff movements and financial transactions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"These audits will help get to the bottom of these matters and provide resolution for all concerned," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We want to be confident that schools operate in the best interests of their students."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>South Australian Education Minister Susan Close said she supported the audit and would work with the commonwealth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She has also asked her department to conduct a review of funding arrangements with the Islamic college in Adelaide to ensure compliance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But in a letter to parents college chairman Farouk Khan defended management of the school and said recent criticism had damaged the reputation of the college and tarnished the perception of the Muslim community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He also defended staff changes saying the board would offer no apologies for removing those who were not performing.</td></tr>
