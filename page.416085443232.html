<h3>Apple Watch Review: The Smartwatch Finally Makes Sense</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Apple Watch screen is only big enough for the important things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WSJ Personal Tech columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler explains why this means less time on devices, more time in real life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Apple Watch puts the iPhone in its proper place?your pocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>I?ve got a utilitarian view of the year?s most-hyped piece of bling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sapphire crystal and $10,000 gold alloy aren?t what make the Apple Watch the first smartwatch worth buying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>What?s valuable is your time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Apple Watch is a computer built to spend it better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And if you can tolerate single-day battery life, half-baked apps and inevitable obsolescence, you can now wear the future on your wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Smartphones gave us the wondrous ability to take the Internet anywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But they?re not always productive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In fact, they?ve become like cigarettes, leaving us itching for the latest affirmation from Instagram or Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I found I spend 4.3 hours each day looking at my phone?good grief, even on vacation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>So the company that invented the iPhone has a solution: Buy another gadget!</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That irony didn?t escape me a week ago when I began wearing an Apple Watch, on loan before they become available on April 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Do I really need another connected screen blinking, beeping and buzzing all day?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I?ve found the Apple Watch isn?t a replacement for the iPhone, but it?s the right screen for many important things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>I only look at it in blips, for rarely more than five seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It shows me the weather with one finger swipe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It gets physical, gently tapping my wrist when something important needs my attention and lighting up when I lift my arm to look.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It nudges when I?ve been sitting too long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>With an Apple Watch, you can answer incoming calls from your iPhone right on your wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A graph of brightly colored concentric circles reports how much you?ve moved, exercised and stayed on your feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The watch allows you to buy things with Apple Pay, even if your phone isn't around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Wrist-top navigation could be great, though the Apple Watch can?t load maps fast enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Apple Watch doubles as a selfie machine, giving you a remote viewfinder and shutter for the iPhone camera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The 42 mm stainless steel Apple Watch with Link Bracelet?here showing its app launch screen?costs $1,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>On the underside of all Apple Watches is an array of sensors for detecting heart rate and presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>If you?re not wearing the watch, it locks down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>This description may either strike you as helpful or oppressive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>It has made me more present.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>I?m less likely to absent-mindedly reach for my phone, or feel compelled to leave it on the table during supper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>With the Apple Watch, smartwatches finally make sense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The measure of their success shouldn?t be how well they suck you in, but how efficiently they help you get things done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Living on your arm is part of that efficiency?as a convenient display, but also a way to measure your heart rate or pay at a cash register.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>This is a big idea about how we use technology, the kind of idea we expect from Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Which isn?t to say that this first Apple Watch will appeal to all iPhone owners, or even a significant fraction of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Shrinking a computer onto a wrist required many compromises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The Apple Watch turns some of these into opportunities for smart ideas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Others still need refinement?and a reason for many to wait for an Apple Watch 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>One big challenge Apple conquered is making its wrist computer small and stylish enough to wear without a nerdy pocket protector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>My colleague Joanna Stern and I agree the Apple Watch is a fine watch for both men and women?a standard previous smartwatches couldn?t meet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Yet the $1,000 steel 42mm version I tested is still a bit thicker than I?d want, as tall as a stack of six quarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>And you can?t soap it up in a shower, though a little rain won?t hurt it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The battery lives up to its all-day billing, but sometimes just barely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>It?s often nearly drained at bedtime, especially if I?ve used the watch for exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>There?s a power-reserve mode that can make it last a few hours longer, but then it only shows the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The Apple Watch?s screen does an adequate job outdoors, but less so in the direct sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Most of the Apple Watch?s screens feature white text on a black background, which helps some.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>The Apple Watch doesn?t have cellular connection, so you?ll need a companion iPhone nearby for many of its functions to work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Sometimes, though, that arrangement is painfully slow: The maps app, surely the answer to wandering pedestrians?</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>dreams, is so slow it makes me want to pull out my paper Rand McNally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The watch does work (a little) away from the phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>When you?re around a known Wi-Fi network, the watch can tap directly into it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>When the iPhone?s at home, you can still use Apple Watch to track your heart rate and progress during a run or use it for Apple Pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Perhaps the biggest limitation for a wrist computer is us humans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Most of us, save a few yogis, aren?t comfortable holding our arms up for very long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>It?s here that Apple applies its design expertise for its boldest idea: Minimizing the time you spend touching the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Which Watch?</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Cut out the Apple Watch and some of its rivals to try on for size.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>This emphasis on quick interactions requires you to learn a new sign language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Alerts and information appear only when you need them, and then disappear on their own?no need to dismiss them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Instead of pinching to zoom, there?s a digital crown to turn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>And there?s two ways to tap on the screen, regular and ?force touch,?</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>which shows more options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>In return, there are new sensations, such as a mechanism that gently taps your wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>It?s far more discreet than the rattle of a vibrating phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>You can grok all of this in an hour or two, but you?ll definitely want someone to show it to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>? Making sure I don?t miss that email from mom, or another VIP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>? Communicating an emotion, either through a set of cheesy animated icons?I?m talking jazz hands in mime gloves?or tapping with two fingers to literally share a simulation of your heartbeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Maybe we?ll get to blow a kiss in Version 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>? Buying something: Tap twice on the watch?s side button to activate Apple Pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>? Checking on the weather or news through ?glances,?</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>available by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>? Asking virtual assistant Siri a question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>? Controlling music, and sometimes even video, on my phone, Bluetooth headset or Apple TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>? Taking a photo: A wrist app gives a live view of your iPhone?s high-quality rear camera?so you can set the phone up for a better selfie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>? Answering a call: Talking to your wrist might look funny, but it?s a remarkably good speakerphone, and you can switch over to your iPhone mid-call if you?d like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>It?s worth noting that doing much of this around other people calls for new rules of etiquette, or at least new tolerance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>When is it OK to speak to your watch?</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>(People thought I was talking to them when I was actually trying to dictate.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Is it appropriate to peek at a wrist alert during a meeting with your boss?</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>What about on a date?</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>The Apple Watch?s design diligence also includes things it doesn?t attempt to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>The Apple Watch has no Web browser, no keyboard and no way to reply to emails, though you can flag and delete them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>Yet the Apple Watch isn?t quite the gatekeeper to my digital life that I wanted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Take app alerts?there?s a fine line between being in the know and having your wrist jiggle all day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>It never got horrible for me, because Apple lets you assign VIP status to individual contacts and specify which apps can trigger alerts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>But setting up all of this is a tedious?and unfortunately ongoing?chore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>It?s here that I missed some of the intelligence of Google (and its services, all absent) on the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>Google?s Android Wear still floods your wrist with annoying alerts and trails the Apple Watch OS in design.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>But Apple should find out what Gmail knows, and suggest contacts who might be alert-worthy based on how much I?ve connected with them before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>The big reason many people?even many Apple fans?will skip the Apple Watch is that it?s too new.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>There isn?t yet a world of apps and services beyond Apple?s own, with independent developers?</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>sparks of genius showing us all the things a smartwatch can be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>In fact, apps have been the biggest disappointment of my Apple Watch experience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>Apple says more than 1,000 Watch apps have been submitted, but only about three dozen have been available to test.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Aside from some apps that deliver fresh news headlines, including the Journal?s, as well as ones from the New York Times, CNN and Flipboard, not enough felt useful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>Apps?which download to the watch automatically if you?ve installed them on your iPhone?are relegated to a secondary launch screen that?s attractive but harder to use, a cluster of tiny circles that you have to zoom in on and fish out, like some weird game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>Still, in these early sketches of an experience, I can already imagine so much more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>I?d like for the Apple Watch to be my train ticket and my office key, for starters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>For now, the Apple Watch is for pioneers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>I won?t pay the $1,000 it would cost for the model I tested, only to see a significant improvement roll in before too long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>But I plan to pay $400 for the 42mm Sport version once it?s on sale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>That?s worth paying for a front-row seat for what?s next in tech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>Write to Geoffrey A. Fowler at Geoffrey.Fowler@wsj.com or on Twitter @geoffreyfowler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>It is all in the "eyes of the? beholder" like Shakespeare said a few moons ago!?Just like you look at your brother's wife and say, "wow what he must have?seeing in?her" and wonder how your brother married her in the first place.?But, to each its own, I got my own personal reasons for buying and owning an Apple product--it has to do with making all my devices talk to each other, simplification of my?life or structuring it like only Apple knows, image, prestige, and just a "feeling of fulfillment" knowing I am part of a 634 Billion dollars technology behemoth....this is what Apple makes me feel, like Toyota's old car commercial "Ohhh ohhhh what a feeling, Toyota!!!"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>Same with Apple, most of us will buy an iWatch just out of pure customer loyalty and love of brand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>It is all in the "eyes of the? beholder" like Shakespeare said a few moons ago!?</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>Just like you look at your brother's wife and say, "wow what he must have?seeing in?her" and wonder how your brother married her in the first place.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>But, to each its own, I got my own personal reasons for buying and owning an Apple product--it has to do with making all my devices talk to each other, simplification of my?life or structuring it like only Apple knows, image, prestige, and just a "feeling of fulfillment" knowing I am part of a 634 Billion dollars technology behemoth....this is what Apple makes me feel, like Toyota's old car commercial "Ohhh ohhhh what a feeling, Toyota!!!"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>@HECTOR OSEGUERA?..</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>both of you?</td></tr>
<tr><td>113</td><td>@HECTOR OSEGUERA?</td></tr>
<tr><td>114</td><td>I bet you have Tim Cook on your phone as the screen saver, right??</td></tr>
<tr><td>115</td><td>C'mon, don't be shy.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>116</td><td>MAN CRUSH.</td></tr>
<tr><td>117</td><td>It amazes me how many analysts sing praises on Apple's products.If you look at the evolution of smart watches, I believe LG and Motorola's latest watches have much better design, build quality and have similar or better feature set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>118</td><td>Sad to see that analysts are writing based on their vendor bias and not based on facts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>119</td><td>Don't dismiss the Microsoft Band.</td></tr>
<tr><td>120</td><td>I've been using one for a couple of months and love it, even though I'm a bit of a technophobe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>121</td><td>For getting messages, calendar reminders, alarm setting, and all the exercise functions, it's working great.</td></tr>
<tr><td>122</td><td>I'll be interested to know how easily we 50 somethings who need readers/cheaters can read the display.</td></tr>
<tr><td>123</td><td>I went with the 6plus, or Megaphone as my wife teases, mostly so I can see and read what its showing me without having to always reach for my specs.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>124</td><td>Didn't WSJ just post an article earlier in the week that said these devices weren't ready for prime time?</td></tr>
<tr><td>125</td><td>@John Klein?</td></tr>
<tr><td>126</td><td>Things move fast in the tech world.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>127</td><td>The little white envelopes for each of the writers were held up in the mail, but once the payola was delivered the Apple watch moved to the top of the must have list for all good little boys and girls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>128</td><td>I just can't believe the extend people would go to enjoy Apple's Kool-Aid.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>129</td><td>I plan to order mine on Friday.?I think it will allow me to execute some tasks more efficiently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>130</td><td>I wear a watch anyway, so switching to the Apple Watch won't be a big change physically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>131</td><td>I am sure it will improve over time as most tech items do.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>132</td><td>I think the watch can be very useful to deliver alerts.Most people get only 5 to 10 emails to their "Important" Google Inbox- in ?a day.The same is probably even more true for Portfolio and weather alerts.?Intelligent filtering may alert me to potential traffic problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>133</td><td>Off course- reminders is one area where the Watch should excel.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>134</td><td>I am not convinced that Apple ?Watch design is better than Androidware- but I have not seen the watch in person.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>135</td><td>@Elliott Widaski?</td></tr>
<tr><td>136</td><td>Best post of the last week!</td></tr>
<tr><td>137</td><td>Geoffrey..Get a life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>138</td><td>So why exactly were you enticed to buy the latest 'larger' screen IPhone only to keep it in your pocket?</td></tr>
<tr><td>139</td><td>Have we become so self important and so lazy than we need an easier way to ignore everything else that's going on around us?</td></tr>
<tr><td>140</td><td>It's perfect...if you're too lazy or obsessed with self importance that you can't simply look at your phone ?(or look up) to check the weather.?It's great if you can't seem to remember when to work out or to determine on your own, if you've been sitting too long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>141</td><td>The watch, like the gadgets before it, are a waste of time and money and are geared to people who lack self discipline or are so driven by trends, that they must have the latest gadget put out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>142</td><td>You really don't need to be connected to the cyber world every second of every minute of every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>143</td><td>?You really don't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>144</td><td>The major flaw...it's thick and ugly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>145</td><td>I can't wait to see people looking at their wrists every five seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>146</td><td>The i watch is a perfect example of the herd mentality!!</td></tr>
<tr><td>147</td><td>The anti-Apple Watch crowd is kind of funny to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>148</td><td>- "How does an iPod improve my life? I already have a Discman and it works great. Just another gadget to have to manage. I'll pass."</td></tr>
<tr><td>149</td><td>- "How could I possibly use a phone that doesn't have but two buttons? That doesn't even make sense. I'll pass."</td></tr>
<tr><td>150</td><td>- "The iPad will be an abject failure. It's not a computer. It's not a phone. Who has a use for that?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>151</td><td>Why don't we just wait and watch history repeat itself?</td></tr>
<tr><td>152</td><td>Apple, somehow, someway always seems to break the barrier with a take on a product that previously couldn't gain mass acceptance or by putting out a product that people didn't realize they "need."</td></tr>
<tr><td>153</td><td>The iPhone, iPad, and now Apple Watch weren't/aren't new concepts at launch, but Apple (whether you like it or not) just has a way of doing things right for most consumers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>154</td><td>@Trey Gunn I'm bullish on Apple too, and think eventually Apple Watch will be a winning product, but for now, I'm passing on it, as I passed on the iPhone until the 3GS and the iPad, until the 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>155</td><td>I buy based on the product itself, not the brand name on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>156</td><td>I won't be purchasing an Apple Watch despite being a fan, not a fanboy, of Apple products, with this, the first iteration of the product.</td></tr>
<tr><td>157</td><td>Sure I can look like Dick Tracy (showing my age I guess) wearing and using the watch, and it is a good looking watch (so is the one I wear daily).</td></tr>
<tr><td>158</td><td>It would make using Apple Pay easier for many and more convenient, but most of the list of uses above is handled just as well, likely better, via my Bluetooth headset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>159</td><td>Moreover, for a frequent traveler, the 18 hour battery life of the watch is a major non-starter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>160</td><td>I think it was a major blunder on Apple's part to underestimate the need to have this watch last 36-48 hours between charges, under normal use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>161</td><td>My suspicion is, by the time they get to Apple Watch 3, the watch will be physically much improved and have some really well designed apps which will make it worthwhile to purchase at that point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>162</td><td>Good points.all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>163</td><td>By gen 3 the Watch will BE the phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>164</td><td>Stay long!</td></tr>
<tr><td>165</td><td>@Ned Levi Remember the GREAT new watch you didn't have to wind?</td></tr>
<tr><td>166</td><td>Enough with these apple watch stories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>167</td><td>Who cares?</td></tr>
<tr><td>168</td><td>@Sean DeGabriel Many care, including Apple stockholders, and Apple competitors, and they care a great deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>169</td><td>There is potentially a lot riding on this product.</td></tr>
<tr><td>170</td><td>"And if you can tolerate single-day battery life, half-baked apps and inevitable obsolescence".</td></tr>
<tr><td>171</td><td>Sounds like just the thing one needs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>172</td><td>@Mark Norato I wonder what happens to it when your get caught in a hard rain, forget you have it on and hop in the shower, etc?</td></tr>
<tr><td>173</td><td>Is it so hard to pull out an iPhone from it's holster and look at it?</td></tr>
<tr><td>174</td><td>Well if you already need to wear a iPhone with the watch then wearing another big chunk battery pack will not make a deference either.</td></tr>
<tr><td>175</td><td>It's not beam me up Scotty yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>176</td><td>I'll let the hipsters have this one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>177</td><td>@Heath Anderson?The hipsters don't want it.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>178</td><td>Today's hipsters have never worn watches.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>179</td><td>They don't see the point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>180</td><td>A "Watch" offers two things:?</td></tr>
<tr><td>181</td><td>a convenient I/O and health data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>182</td><td>Here's how you can eventually interact with your watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>183</td><td>Siri:?</td></tr>
<tr><td>184</td><td>Mike, it's your mom's birthday this week, do you want me to send the same flowers as last year?</td></tr>
<tr><td>185</td><td>Mike:?</td></tr>
<tr><td>186</td><td>No I was thinking about a printer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>187</td><td>Siri: The same one you bought from Amazon?</td></tr>
<tr><td>188</td><td>Mike: Yes please.</td></tr>
<tr><td>189</td><td>Siri: It's cheaper at Target.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>190</td><td>Do you want to order it from there?</td></tr>
<tr><td>191</td><td>Siri: Mike, your Mom's watch is showing an elevated and irregular heartbeat.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>192</td><td>She hasn't responded to her watch's voice prompts asking if she is okay??</td></tr>
<tr><td>193</td><td>Do you want to call her?</td></tr>
<tr><td>194</td><td>Mike: No, She hated the printer I sent her.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>195</td><td>Let her fend for herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>196</td><td>I'm calling 911.</td></tr>
<tr><td>197</td><td>Sure it's a gimmick now, but tech evolves fast, and it's coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>198</td><td>@mike pavulack?..key point in your statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>199</td><td>I'll let the Apple fanbois and tech geeks spend the thousands to play with the stuff until eventually finally gets here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>200</td><td>Im 21 and I will most likely get one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>201</td><td>Its not because I think it's the future, and it's not because I want to be cool either.</td></tr>
<tr><td>202</td><td>I would like a watch, a nice watch, but don't have the money to buy one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>203</td><td>I could buy a designer watch, but those are roughly $500-$700, and almost all have less than positive reviews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>204</td><td>I already have and iPhone and know what to expect from an Apple product.</td></tr>
<tr><td>205</td><td>So why not spend the money on an iWatch?</td></tr>
<tr><td>206</td><td>We already buy $1200 computers and spend $300 on headphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>207</td><td>When I buy mine I will almost surely buy one for my mother for the heart beat feature, just to make sure she is alive.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>208</td><td>@Jim Jirsa You are making a whole lot more at 21 than I was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>209</td><td>?Kudos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>210</td><td>@Jim Jirsa "So why not spend the money on an iWatch?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>211</td><td>Why not save the money instead of blowing it on something you'll be bored with in a month?</td></tr>
<tr><td>212</td><td>@Charleen Larson?That's a good point, but I plan on getting a watch anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>213</td><td>I'm hoping I will be less bored with the iWatch than with a designer watch!</td></tr>
<tr><td>214</td><td>The Apple watch does not have a cellular connection and it needs the i phone.Therefore the cost of owning both the phone and watch is ridiculously high.What a dumb idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>215</td><td>In three years the Watch will be as ubiquitous as their Iphone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>216</td><td>They will be sold as a package and will be the greatest idea Apple ever had.</td></tr>
<tr><td>217</td><td>Eventually the Watch will supplant both the smart phone and tablet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>218</td><td>It will be so convenient and efficient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>219</td><td>Buy the stock!</td></tr>
<tr><td>220</td><td>Typical of the Luddite WSJ crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>221</td><td>?I remember all the negative tablet talk when the iPad launched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>222</td><td>Another stupid e-product with no battery life, that serves no useful purpose: this one is little more than jewelry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>223</td><td>?Then again, people will wear ridiculous ear pieces to avoid picking up their phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>224</td><td>?And still everyone talking to "the air" in public, totally oblivious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>225</td><td>?Ugh!</td></tr>
<tr><td>226</td><td>This thing is ridiculous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>227</td><td>But many will waste their money and time just to think they are "cool".</td></tr>
<tr><td>228</td><td>@jack witty?Give it a few years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>229</td><td>Wearable tech is the future.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>230</td><td>@Neil MacMillan?@jack witty Some e-geeks are so addicted, only "injectable-tech" will give them the high they seek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>231</td><td>The reason this Apple fan will skip the Dick Tracy watch is because it adds complexity without usefulness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>232</td><td>I don't have any problem the Apple Watch would solve, having long since given up on looking hip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>233</td><td>And, I admit, I'm a little annoyed that Yosemite on our two iMac Retina 5ks continues to drop wifi on a daily basis.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>234</td><td>Apple hasn't earned further business from us.</td></tr>
