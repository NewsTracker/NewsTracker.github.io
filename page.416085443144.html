<tr><td>4</td><td>BAGHDAD (AP) - The Islamic State group released more than 200 Yazidis on Wednesday after holding them for eight months, the latest mass release of captives by the extremists targeted by U.S.-led airstrikes and an Iraqi ground offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Gen. Hiwa Abdullah, a peshmerga commander in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, said most of the freed 216 prisoners were in poor health and bore signs of abuse and neglect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He added that about 40 children are among those released, while the rest were elderly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>No reason was given for the release of the prisoners who were originally abducted from the area around Sinjar in the country's north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The handover took place in Himera just southwest of Kirkuk, 290 kilometers (180 miles) north of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The freed captives wept and called out to God when greeted by their families, some so weak they lay on the arid ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Women wiped away tears with their long headscarves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We are very happy now," said Mahmoud Haji, one of the released Yazidis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We were worried that they were taking us to Syria and Raqqa," the Islamic State group's de facto capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Also among those released was Jar-Allah Frensis, a 88-year-old Christian farmer, and his wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Frensis said the militants broke into his house in Sinjar and arrested him along with his wife and son.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Then, the family was separated and the son was taken away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said he still doesn't know what happened to his son.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The militants took all of our money and jewelry. We have been living under constant fear till our release," Frensis told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the release, his spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Obviously, any release of innocent civilians is to be welcomed and I think one couldn't help but being moved by the pictures" of the Yazidis after they were freed, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled in August when the Islamic State group captured the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar, near the Syrian border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But hundreds were taken captive by the group, with some Yazidi women forced into slavery, according to international rights groups and Iraqi officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In January, the Islamic State group released some 200 Yazidi prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>At the time, Kurdish military officials said they believed the extremists released the prisoners as they were too much of a burden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>This latest release comes after Iraqi ground forces, backed by U.S.-led airstrikes, retook the city of Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Islamic State group still holds about a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in its self-declared caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The U.S. launched the airstrikes and humanitarian aid drops in Iraq on Aug. 8, partly in response to the Yazidi crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Sunni militant group views Yazidis and Shiite Muslims as apostates deserving of death, and has demanded Christians either convert to Islam or pay a special tax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The group has massacred hundreds of captive soldiers and tribal fighters who have risen up against it, publicizing the killings in sleek online photos and videos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In other violence Wednesday in Iraq, police and hospital officials said a bomb exploded near an outdoor market in Baghdad's southeastern suburb of Nahrwan, killing four people and wounding 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Associated Press writers Ahmed Sami in Baghdad, Imad Matti in Kirkuk, Iraq, and Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations contributed to this report.</td></tr>
