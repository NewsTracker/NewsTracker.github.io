<h3>Baltimore finds fragile calm while awaiting answers to man's death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE (Reuters) - Reeling from its worst civil unrest in decades, Baltimore found a semblance of calm on Wednesday, but police dashed expectations they would release a report this week on the death of a 25-year-old black man that set off rioting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Citizens await answers about the fate of Freddie Gray, who died after suffering spinal injuries while in police custody, while also highlighting the need to reform policing practices in the largely black city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The violence in Baltimore prompted national figures - from the new U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton - to weigh in on Wednesday and vow to work on improving law enforcement and criminal justice in minority communities nationwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Baltimore is the latest flashpoint in the reignited debate about race relations in the United States, stoked by the deaths of black men over the past year at the hands of police in New York, Ferguson, Missouri; Cleveland, Ohio, and elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Police have said they would conclude their investigation into Gray's death by Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>At a news briefing on Wednesday afternoon, police spokesman Captain Eric Kowalczyk said the conclusions would not be made public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We cannot release all of the information from this investigation to the public because if there is a decision to charge in any event by the state's attorney's office, the integrity of that investigation has to be protected," Kowalczyk said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a separate probe into possible civil rights violations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>With police and National Guard troops patrolling Baltimore's streets, schools reopened and business resumed in the city of 620,000 two days after rioting, looting and arson that injured 20 officers and led to more than 250 arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A week-long curfew that began Tuesday helped police thwart violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Police said 35 people have been arrested since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Crowds gathered on Wednesday afternoon for a march on city hall and police appealed for calm, saying they expected a large group of demonstrators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Solidarity demonstrations were planned in New York City and also in Cleveland and Minneapolis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Baltimore's Major League Baseball team, the Orioles, played the Chicago White Sox in an empty stadium, a sign of the tenuous security situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Baltimore's Symphony Orchestra staged an impromptu concert for a gathering of several hundred people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>While the city was returning to normalcy, residents in the most affected neighborhoods vented their frustration with police and expressed a desire to see at least some of the officers who arrested Gray, held accountable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It doesn't have to be all of them, we don't want to be told some story. We want to know the truth," said Kevin Eaton, a 52-year-old musician.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Eaton, who lived through the Los Angeles riots in 1992, said the city would need to repair relations between the police and the community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Will Jackson, 46, remembered police harassment when he was a teen in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He has moved out of the city but returned on Tuesday to help clean up and to protect young protesters from riot-gear-clad police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said he expected to see the city take legal action against the officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The decision has to be that the police did wrong. All six, not one or two, all six. The city is very angry right now, they are tired of all the police brutality," Jackson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"If that's not the decision, I worry there will be more riots."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Gray had been arrested on April 12 after fleeing from police in a high-crime area and was carrying a switchblade knife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He died a week later and after his funeral on Monday, rioters went on a rampage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Lynch, who was sworn in as attorney general on Monday, called Baltimore's riots "senseless acts of violence" that are counterproductive to the ultimate goal of "developing a respectful conversation within the Baltimore community and across the nation about the way our law enforcement officers interact" with residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Clinton on Wednesday urged police departments throughout the country to use body cameras and called for an end to excessive prison sentences that burden black communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"There is something wrong when a third of all black men face the prospect of prison during their lifetimes," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Some residents of Baltimore - where a quarter of the people live in poverty - echoed that view.</td></tr>
