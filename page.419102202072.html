<h3>Sierra Leone Ebola head says country has 4 cases</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sierra Leone has only four recorded cases of Ebola, the West African nation's head of Ebola said Thursday, adding that he is hopeful the countdown to zero can soon begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Two of the cases have proven negative after treatments, and the other two, in the north Tonkolili district, are in treatment, said National Emergency Response Center chief Alfred Palo Conteh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The end of this virus is in sight," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Tonkolili district remains a worry, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Authorities last week quarantined 500 people after a man died from Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The district had not had a single case of Ebola in five months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The victim contracted the disease in the capital, traveled to his home village, and was treated for a fever at the local hospital but authorities didn't call the Ebola emergency number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He didn't have a burial that followed special procedures required for Ebola victims, and the man's mother and brother contracted the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This could happen again in any of the silent districts and we must all do what it takes to prevent a recurrence elsewhere," Palo Conteh said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The World Health Organization on Wednesday said nearly 2,000 contacts are being monitored across Guinea and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It also warned that the rainy season in the three countries hit hardest by the Ebola outbreak - Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia - will prove a challenge for slowing the spread of the deadly virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This Ebola outbreak has killed more than 11,200 people, mostly in West Africa.</td></tr>
