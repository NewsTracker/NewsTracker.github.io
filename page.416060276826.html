<h3>Greek Syriza party demands ?200bn from Germany for Nazi reparations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece has demanded more than 200billion in compensation from Germany for Nazi atrocities during the Second World War.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The government yesterday unveiled its final calculation for the war reparations stemming from occupation by the Third Reich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The radical left Syriza party says Germany owes Greece nearly 279billion euros, or 204billion to compensate it for looting and war crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The German government says the issue was resolved legally years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The demand comes just days before Greece is obliged to pay 450million euros of its debt to the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, has said the country 'intends to meet all obligations to all its creditors, ad infinitum'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greece suffered a brutal occupation at the hands Adolf Hitler's forces in 1941.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>More than 40,000 people are believed to have starved to death in Athens alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Yesterday a parliamentary committee established by Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras for the first time put an official number on the reparations claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It includes the cost of a 10billion euro forced Nazi loan made by the Bank of Greece and the return of archaeological treasures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The revised figures amount to nearly 10 per cent of Germany's GDP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Tsipras raised the reparations issue when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He has called the reparations question a 'moral and ethical' issue for his country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The new figure was revealed yesterday by Greek deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'According to our calculations, the debt linked to German reparations is 278.7bn euros,' he told a parliamentary committee investigating responsibility for Greece's debt crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Mardas said the reparations calculation had been made by Greece's state general accounting office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Berlin paid 115m deutschmarks to Athens in 1960 in compensation - a fraction of the Greek demand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Greece says this did not cover payments for damaged infrastructure, war crimes and the return of the forced loan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Germany insists the reparations issue was settled in 1990 legally and politically before Germany reunified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Syriza politicians have frequently blamed Germany for the hardship suffered by Greeks under the tough bailout conditions imposed by international lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ministers have floated the idea of seizing German assets in the country to compensate the families of victims of Nazi war crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A poll carried for Greek radio found more than 80 per cent of Greeks agreed with the pusuit of Nazi war debt claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Yesterday Greek MPs also voted to establish a committee examining the circumstances of its 2010 bail-out by eurozone creditors and the IMF to the tune of 240billion euros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>'After five years of parliamentary silence on the major issues that caused the bailout catastrophe, today we commence a procedure that will give answers to the questions concerning the Greek people,' Mr Tsipras said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has claimed the economy was unfairly lumbered with the liabilities that it is now struggling to pay off as its coffers run empty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He has claimed Europe dealt with his country's bankruptcy by 'loading the largest loan in human history on the weakest of shoulders - the Greek taxpayer'.</td></tr>
