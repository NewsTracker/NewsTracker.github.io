<h3>Chung Mong-Joon announces bid to run for FIFA president</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>South Korea's Chung Mong-Joon gestures during a press conference in Paris, France, Monday Aug.17, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Chung Mong-Joon announced his candidacy for the upcoming FIFA presidential elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Announcing his bid to run for FIFA president, Chung Mong-Joon pledged to help the governing body clean itself up if he gets elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Speaking at a news conference in Paris on Monday, the South Korea said "it is my privilege and honor to announce my candidacy," before quickly turning his sights on long-serving president Sepp Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After 17 years as FIFA president, Blatter said on June 2 he was standing down, under pressure from American and Swiss federal investigations of widespread corruption implicating senior FIFA officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The real reason FIFA has become such a corrupt organization is because the same person and his cronies have been running it for 40 years. Absolute power corrupts absolutely," Chung said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On May 27, a United States federal investigation of corruption in world soccer was unleashed on FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Though Blatter won re-election two days later, it took only four more days before he decided to step down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Chung, a FIFA honorary vice president, promised change if he wins the election on Feb. 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Under these circumstances, the FIFA president must be a crisis manager and a reformer. He must be more than just a head of the technical department," the 63-year-old South Korean Chung said at a Paris hotel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"After decades of an ever-widening circle of corruption, FIFA needs a leader who can bring back common sense, transparency and accountability."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>UEFA President Michel Platini has already declared his candidacy and is widely favored to replace Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The former France midfielder, a FIFA insider after 13 years as an executive committee member, has taken advantage of his access to soccer powerbrokers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>At the Champions League final in Berlin and FIFA meetings in Zurich and St. Petersburg, Russia, he outlined his plans and gained early support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Michel was a great football player. I played golf twice with Michel, his swing is not that great, it's lucky he chose football instead of golf," Chung said, who criticized Platini for having a "father and son" and "mentor-student" relationship with Blatter over the years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Platini was formerly a supporter of Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Would-be candidates must apply by Oct. 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>FIFA members from the 209 national federations elect the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, who lost the last FIFA election vote 133-73 to Blatter on May 29, is also touted to stand again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Former Brazil great Zico, who scored 48 goals in 71 games for his country, and Liberian soccer federation president Musa Bility are also among those reportedly planning to run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Chung was a member of FIFA's executive committee from the mid-1990s until 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>During that time, he was an opponent of Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In a clear swipe at Platini, who is now an outspoken opponent of Blatter, Chung said "it has suddenly become very fashionable to be Blatter's enemy, this is too convenient."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A former equestrian rider and cross-country skier and president of the Korean Football Association, Chung failed in his bid to become mayor of Seoul last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Chung launched his campaign despite having little obvious support in Asia, where South Korea's influence has weakened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Asian Football Confederation leaders have welcomed Platini's bid and FIFA executive committee member Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah of Kuwait, an influential Olympic powerbroker, is seen to have presidential ambitions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Chung's cousin, Korean FA president Chung Mong-gyu, was defeated in April standing for one of Asia's four FIFA executive seats.</td></tr>
