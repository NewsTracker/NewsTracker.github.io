<h3>Katter questions fight for Bali Nine duo</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The outspoken north Queenslander is still smarting over a decision by the Gillard government to suspend the live cattle trade to Indonesia over animal cruelty claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In parliament on Wednesday, he asked Foreign Minister Julie Bishop about government attempts to save convicted drug traffickers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan from execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Katter cited comments from former domestic spy chief David Irvine who called for Australia to do more to create a relationship with Jakarta that was meaningful to Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>You only had to look at the Indonesian parliament to see the level of dislike of Australia, Mr Irvine said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ms Bishop conceded the coalition had inherited a number of tensions in its relationship with Indonesia, nominating border protection, a spying scandal and the live cattle ban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There will be challenges in the relationship as there are with any relationships, but Australia is determined to ensure that this is a strong relationship that endures," she said, insisting the government had made respectful representations for the lives of Sukumaran and Chan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some Liberal MPs reportedly are also concerned about the government's focus on the Bali Nine ringleaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>West Australian MP Luke Simpkins raised the issue during a partyroom meeting on Tuesday, the ABC said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He suggested the government had "exhausted all avenues" and needed to shift its focus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Later in a statement, Mr Katter urged the government not to "play with fire" with Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The member for Kennedy said he and northern cattlemen had been pushing to repair relations with the country since the live cattle ban, including numerous meetings with the ambassador.</td></tr>
