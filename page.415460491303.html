<h3>Al Qaeda got $1million in CIA money from fund to free Afghan diplomat</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Abdul Khaliq Farahi was the Afghan consul general in Peshawar, Pakistan, when he was kidnapped in 2008 and handed over to Al Qaeda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was released two years later after Afghanistan paid the terrorist group a $5million ransom, a fifth of which was from the CIA, the New York Times reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The money came from an Afghan government fund that received secret monthly cash deliveries from the CIA, the Times reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The deliveries were made to the presidential palace in Kabul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Letters about the ransom payment were found during the 2011 raid by US Navy SEALS that killed Osama Bin Laden at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a June 2010 letter to Bin Laden, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, Al Qaeda's general manager, wrote: 'God blessed us with a good amount of money this month'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He wrote the money would be used for weapons, operational needs and payments to families of Al Qaeda fighters held in Afghanistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The communications were submitted as evidence in the trial of Abid Naseer, who was convicted this month in New York of supporting terrorism and plotting to bomb a shopping center in Manchester, England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bin Laden had at first been concerned about the ransom payment, fearing the CIA knew how the money would be used and had tainted it with poison, radiation or a tracking device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He suggested the money be converted to another currency to 'be on the safe side'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The money the CIA delivered while President Hamid Karzai was in charge was used to buy the support of warlords, legislators and others, as well as expenses for clandestine diplomatic trips and housing for senior officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Afghan officials reportedly said the payments have slowed since Ashraf Ghani became president in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The CIA declined to comment on the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In addition to the Al Qaeda correspondence, the story was based on conversations with Afghan and Western officials.</td></tr>
