<h3>Harper says his government will ask for ?extension and expansion? of mission against Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The federal government's current six-month mission in Iraq against Islamic State militants - part of an international effort - is set to expire April 7 and there has been mounting expectation the government will prolong the mission until possibly after a federal election scheduled for Oct. 19, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Several dozen special forces troops have been deployed to northern Iraq since September, while six fighter jets, two surveillance aircraft, a refuelling plane and around 600 support personnel have been based in Kuwait since October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Harper said Wednesday that his government is now prepared to officially request another mandate from Parliament to extend and expand the military mission that has seen Canadian soldiers on the front lines and has led to a death of one Canadian soldier and three others injured in a friendly fire accident with Kurdish soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The current mission was authorized in the fall and that authority comes due fairly shortly. Next week it is the government's plan to move forward with a request from Parliament for extension and expansion of the mission. And I will obviously give more details when we do that," Harper told reporters at an event in Mississauga, Ont.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Asked whether the expansion of the mission could include going into Syria, where the Islamic State has a strong presence, Harper didn't rule it out, saying instead that he will provide more details next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Let me just say the current authorization laid open the possibility of going to Syria, although we have not done that, but we'll address issues like that next week when I make a proposal to the House of Commons."</td></tr>

<h3>Will Windows 10 be the start of the end for computer passwords?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For the frequently forgetful, it could prove to be a lifeline: Microsoft has announced what could lead to the phasing out of computer passwords.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Computers running the new Windows 10 operating system will be unlocked using face, iris or fingerprint recognition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Once logged-in the device will then authenticate on the users' behalf for websites and applications, say Microsoft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The technology giant claims using biometric data is safer than passwords and that it has included "anti-spoofing capabilities" that stops would-be hackers from logging in to a device using a photo or selfie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A survey for technology firm Centrify claimed businesses lost more than 394 euros each year because of employees grappling with forgotten passwords.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Microsoft, promoting its new Windows Hello technology, said in a blog post: "Today, passwords are the primary method most of us use to protect our personal information, but they are inconvenient and insecure. They are easily hackable and even when complex they are not effective, but most of us want something easy to remember, so we either choose a simple password or end up noting it down somewhere making it less secure. And, to be truly secure, you need to remember dozens of passwords to login to your many devices and services."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Windows 10 will be released this summer, but no exact date has been fixed, the corporation added.</td></tr>
