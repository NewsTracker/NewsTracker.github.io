<h3>Will the Apple Watch Eclipse the Classics?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BRAINY SEASON | The era of the luxe smartwatch is dawning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple Watch Edition 42MM 18K Gold Case with Classic Buckle, $15,000, preorder at apple.com Photo: Photo Illustration by F.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lately, I've been thinking about how my daughter will react when I eventually give her one of my impressively fancy mechanical watches, the first of which I received from my parents when I graduated from college.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She's only two-and-a-half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>So we've got some time before she hits a milestone deserving of an heirloom Cartier or an IWC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the Apple Watch, which after several months of buildup and anticipation will finally be available to the public on April 24, feels like a looming force that may well change her generation's idea of what a luxury watch is.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Like many smartwatches, Apple's is designed to let you quickly dictate responses to text messages, check the weather, find a child-friendly Ethiopian restaurant-things you'd normally rely on your smartphone to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>(Caveat: It doesn't have cellular capabilities so many of its functions aren't available if it isn't paired wirelessly with an iPhone.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But while several smartwatches-also known as "connected watches" and "wearables"-have entered the market, none has so directly and deftly taken aim at both the male and female luxury and fashion consumer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>To wit, the company invited an international crew of fashion editors out to its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., for the announcement of the watch last September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Soon afterward, the watch made an appearance at Paris fashion week, where Apple's design gurus Jonathan Ive and Marc Newson showed it to the likes of Vogue editor Anna Wintour and Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Strapped to a model in a Celine dress, the watch graced the cover of Vogue China's November issue, its first major fashion-magazine outing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But perhaps most important is that, while entry-level Apple Watches start at $349 and go up to $1,099, with an array of bands that range from sporty rubber to steel links, the company is offering a provocatively high-end version called the Edition, which starts at $10,000 and goes up to $17,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>These are made of 18 karat rose gold or yellow gold with a variety of straps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>To try one on, you have to make an appointment at an Apple store that carries them (not all do).</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>And appointments are currently nearly impossible to land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>(Should you find owning a rose-gold model too pedestrian, a number of fine jewelers have been devising methods to pave the case with diamonds and engrave it, among other upgrades.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In other words, the Apple Watch is clearly being positioned as a luxury good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>This all raises the question-what do the boys in Geneva and Paris think?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Will Apple Watch dominance some day force them to abandon their craft and jump into the smartwatch business to stay afloat?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In many ways, their reaction amounts to little more than the brushing away of a mildly bothersome fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I don't believe [the Apple Watch] will affect the Hublots and Breitlings and Pateks," said Jean-Claude Biver, who is president of LVMH's watch division and CEO of its brand Tag Heuer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"You don't buy a $20,000 watch to tell you what time it is. Time is everywhere. You buy it because it is a piece of art. And art is eternity."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Which brings up the big ticking elephant in the room: Apple Watches will almost certainly never be heirloom pieces, no matter how much gold they are carved from, because, like your iPhone and MacBook, they will inevitably become obsolete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Meanwhile, mechanical watches can, with regular maintenance, last for decades if not centuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>This is a sentiment echoed by nearly everyone I talked to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>(Apple declined to comment on the longevity of its watches.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But the excitement around the Apple Watch and smartwatches in general can't be ignored; people are talking again about watches, which at one point seemed at risk of total irrelevance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It's no coincidence that last month at Baselworld, the luxury-watch world's biggest convention, Tag Heuer announced a partnership with Silicon Valley stalwarts Google and Intel to collaborate on a smartwatch that will be unveiled later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Mr. Biver said that Tag Heuer decided to make a connected timepiece to offer consumers a luxe option that will be significantly less expensive than the Apple Edition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"If I were to sell you a $10,000 or $20,000 smartwatch, my conscience would have a problem," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Maybe it should have a label, like on cigarettes. Warning: This watch is not eternal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Tag's as-yet-unnamed smartwatch will likely start at just under $1,000, said Mr. Biver, while models in ultralight magnesium or titanium could go up to $2,500.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Tag isn't alone among traditional watchmakers in getting into the smart game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In January, Montblanc announced the Montblanc TimeWalker Urban Speed e-Strap, which comes out in June and will be around $400.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It's an innovative solution: All of the gadgetry is in the strap itself (you can connect it to almost any timepiece, not just a Montblanc), meaning that the watch won't end up in the recycling bin once the technology becomes outdated or the next big thing comes along.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Still, Alexander Schmiedt, director of watches at Montblanc, sees this move as a small nod to smart that won't really affect their bread and butter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"The more we have interconnected technologies, the more people will appreciate exactly the opposite," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>So perhaps smartwatches and traditional luxury can ultimately coexist peacefully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Aurel Bacs, head of the new watch department at Phillips auction house thinks so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"Luxury smartwatches could be like a Porsche with a hybrid engine," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"We can have the modern and sensible with the traditional and luxurious. But if there are two camps of watches, that's OK. The guy who drinks a $1,000 Bordeaux at dinner can still have an energy drink the next morning."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>There's only space on a man's left wrist for one watch at a time; everyone will have choices to make.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Club Monaco menswear designer Aaron Levine falls into the mechanical-only camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"When I wear a mechanical watch, I think of the precision required to make it work on such a micro scale. That's pretty awesome as opposed to just a chip," said Mr. Levine, who owns several vintage Rolexes and a Bulova Tank inherited from his father.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"[A watch] is the only piece of jewelry I wear besides a wedding ring. I'm not going to give that up easily."</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Many are simply going with the two-watch solution Mr. Bacs proposes-a little Chateau Margaux, a little Red Bull.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"I'm probably going to wear an Apple Watch during the day, but if I'm going out at night, I'll switch to a more classic watch," said Tony King, CEO of King & Partners, a digital agency whose clients are mainly fashion and luxury brands like Bentley and Akris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>To accompany the Panerai Radiomir he owns, Mr. King said he'd most likely buy the steel-case Apple Watch with a black leather band.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Christopher O'Neill, a New York-based banker and avid collector of Rolexes (he owns about 20) intends to buy the Apple Watch Sport to use at the gym.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"I come from a pretty archaic group of guys who love collecting mechanical watches-nothing is going to disrupt that," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>"The Apple Watch is a gimmicky thing on the side that's kind of useful."</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>For the more digitally savvy watch wearer who grew up with smartphones or is entrenched in the digital world, however, the gold Apple Watch Edition represents a different kind of luxury that's more than a gimmick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Sky Gellatly, a managing partner of consumer marketing agency Team Epiphany, said he'd consider buying an Edition watch, even if it couldn't ever replace his treasured Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>But what about the prospect of his $10,000 smartwatch becoming obsolete in a few years?</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>"It doesn't bother me too much," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>"That's the opportunity cost for living at the speed of innovation, isn't it? It's like paying tens of thousands to sit on the first SpaceX flight. Those who buy the watch are choosing to be at the front of the pack where technology, utility and design all converge."</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>He added, "After all, we're here for a good time, not a long time, right?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Unlike my old Casio Data Bank and other cheap plastic electronics, the cases and bands of the higher end watches should have a much longer useful life than the electronics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>I wonder if Apple might deviate from the historical approach to obsolescence for electronics by making the watch internals replaceable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Even if it required a round trip to a repair depot, that would be a way to ensure the electronics could evolve, without tossing the more durable parts of the watch away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>The Apple Watch is an electronic device, and like all electronic devices before it, will be obsolete and perferred over by the next one that crams more features inside it within a few years' time.After all, it is still a piece of silicon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>The Apple Watch is an electronic device, and like all electronic devices before it, will be obsolete and perferred over by the next one that crams more features inside it within a few years' time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>After all, it is still a piece of silicon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>The mechanical watch, on the other hand, has captured the admiration of generations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Simply watching the Tourbillon mechanism spin and turn and marvelling at the precision and accuracy of something that is, by and large, handmade, is enough to generate the oohs and the ahs over and over again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>That's a fairly boring list of Swiss automatics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Breguet, for one, has far more style for the money, as do some TAG Heuer and Baume & Mercier watches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Apple Watch?</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>You've gotta be kidding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>"You are certainly an iSheep. Apple certainly did get to be successful by getting people to buy the latest version of something they don't really need."</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>I have not bought anything from Apple in more than 20 years that I did not need, period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>I am not a "fashion" buyer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>"Its ok if you buy iPhone, Apple watch, etc. But if you consider yourself a mature adult you should be able to see it is all about crass commercialization and fulfilling a keep up with the latest gadget desire."</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>Nonsense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>You are truly underscoring your ignorance and naivete, which is true of most Windows users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>"And I have no intention of 'eating' my words because they are 100% accurate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Nope.9 months from now, hundreds of thousands of Apple Watches will be in second hand stores when the Watch 2 rolls around.No one dumped a Patek into the trash when the newer version came out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>Fashion dies every few months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>Style remains forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Apple is a fashion company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>I guess I am living in the past given that I just cannot get serious with all of the hype for the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>My Rolex has served me in a very timely manner for 35 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>It is a thing of beauty and a joy forever, as is the 1990 Honda Accord I drive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>@Lee Gaffrey Do you really think an apple watch will appreciate in value like a Rolex does?</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Not a chance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>@Jim Heinken @Lee Gaffrey My trusty Rolex is of the classic Submariner style that, if memory serves, cost $1000 in 1980.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>On more than one occasion I have been offered much more than that in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>Apple has lots of highly paid people, they have to do something.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>So they are pushing the 'watch'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>Steve Jobs had many such failure products, this is nothing new for Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>The success or failure of a product is not always based on the wishes of the creator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>Sometimes other forces are in play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>Facebook gave women a reason to use computers, ... and the iPhone lets them gossip on the phone, -so Facebook and iPhone/mac complement each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>One without the other may not have been as big a success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>The 'watch' does not satisfy any unsatisfied need for women, nor is it functional enough for techies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>But the watch has been a blessing for journalists/editors,..</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>they got some hard cash from Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>Why does anyone care what anyone else buys?</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>If you've ever had a non-Apple branded laptop open in a university common area, you'll get plenty of people who care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>They said the same thing about quartz and digital watches in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>A serious collector or horologist is not going to dump their Swiss time pieces for the newest fad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>I'll keep my dumb Rolex, Girard Perragaux, Omega, etc. on my wrist, and my iPod on my arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>There is not the slightest possibility of smart watches replacing Swiss watches as status symbols, unless they make a smart watch that can be regularly updated to contain the latest and greatest software.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>But throw-away watches?</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>The apple watch has it's place, but a mechanical watch is so much more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>I like gadgets as much as the next guy, but mechanical watches are timeless pieces of art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>I think both have there place, but know an apple watch is going to be obsolete in 5 years, and a new one is already in development.</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>It's not a replacement but just a companion, with a limited life span.</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>To spend 10K or 17K on a throwaway watch, well....that's insane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>It's not the $80K Patek Phillipe that has to worry about the $15K Apple Watch; rather, it's the $1500 Tag Huer that has to worry about the $350-$600 Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>"Will the Apple Watch Eclipse the Classics?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>113</td><td>The so-called classics are a piece of fashion jewelry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>114</td><td>The Apple watch is utilitarian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>115</td><td>Sorry, but a digital screen just can't compare to clock hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>116</td><td>The Classics are heirlooms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>117</td><td>Give one to your kid and watch him stuff it in a drawer while he reaches for his Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>118</td><td>and then do the same thing with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>119</td><td>Welcome to this century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>120</td><td>"No, not if he/she has any class and/or sense of style..."</td></tr>
<tr><td>121</td><td>A subjective, arrogant statement that says more about you than anything else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>122</td><td>@Gary J. Rhine @Carl Castrogiovanni "Give one to your kid and watch him stuff it in a drawer while he reaches for his Apple Watch."</td></tr>
<tr><td>123</td><td>Well, yeah, but then watch that same "kid" as an adult later in life pull that heirloom out of the drawer and realize how lovely it is (as art, jewelry, statement piece, etc.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>124</td><td>And I have no problem with art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>125</td><td>Especially 20th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>126</td><td>@Gary J. Rhine @Carl Castrogiovanni "A subjective, arrogant statement that says more about you than anything else."</td></tr>
<tr><td>127</td><td>Yeah, unlike your entirely classy, "Welcome to this century"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>128</td><td>Sorry, but mechanical watches *are* art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>129</td><td>@Gary J. Rhine @Carl Castrogiovanni "... and then do the same thing with it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>130</td><td>The bottom line is that mechanical watches and small computers worn on the body are such different things that they really don't have any bearing on one another, and articles like this are indeed silly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>131</td><td>Watch wearing has been declining for a while (due in large part to cell phones as time pieces).</td></tr>
<tr><td>132</td><td>@Gary J. Rhine @Carl Castrogiovanni Or put the watch on, go to an interview, meet clients, and get taken more seriously than someone with a smart watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>133</td><td>Utility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>134</td><td>You get it with the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>135</td><td>The others?</td></tr>
<tr><td>136</td><td>Forget it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>137</td><td>I'm amazed at how many comment here about how useless the watch is, or what its long term value is?Many say it just won't succeed or that they won't need or use one?Many say that the old technology (mechanical timepieces) will last forever.Sure, there is always a collector out there for EVERYTHING.Funny thing is MOST of you are NOT riding to work on your horse.Using your rotary dial phone and snapping pictures with your old Kodak film camera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>138</td><td>Technology and the world changes, and that is a good thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>139</td><td>New generations use new technologies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>140</td><td>That is history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>141</td><td>Apple's first generation watch is only the beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>142</td><td>Put your old Blackberry Curve away and join the party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>143</td><td>You don't have to be a "Fan Boy" to like new tech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>144</td><td>The lack of foresight from many here is astounding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>145</td><td>No wonder so many are left behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>146</td><td>Older devices from Apple, despite being obsolete, are quite expensive are not they?</td></tr>
<tr><td>147</td><td>"I have been wearing my Rolex since 1967 when it was my dive watch. With a few tune-ups it has been on my wrist for almost 50 years and is still ticking. I must have strong wrists to bear the pain!! Eventually, my grandsons will inherit it along with my Seamaster and I expect they will pass them on. In a year, the Apple watches will be in the technology trash can and the iSheep will be buying the next need to be cool iThingy!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>148</td><td>Don't count on your heirs to wear them after you are gone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>149</td><td>You cannot control their actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>150</td><td>Also, your anti-Apple comments are similar to what I have heard for many years after buying my first Apple laptop more than 20 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>151</td><td>Most people have "eaten" such words as Apple has climbed to be the world's largest company by market capitalization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>152</td><td>It did not attain that lofty perch by relying on "iSheep."</td></tr>
<tr><td>153</td><td>If it helps the stock price I'm all for "crass commercialization and fulfilling".</td></tr>
<tr><td>154</td><td>@Timothy D. Naegele I'm an information security professional who has had more than a few tech and engineering jobs in the past.I work with many Apple products and have a few for home, but I'm comfortable with PCs running Linux and Windows, servers, network gear, etc. I'm not a technophobe or a schlub.</td></tr>
<tr><td>155</td><td>That said, I wouldn't even give up my TAG for an Apple Watch, let alone my Omega -- not at any price point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>156</td><td>Not the cheaper ones that are in the same price range as a cell phone, and certainly not for $15k.</td></tr>
<tr><td>157</td><td>At that price, is Apple committing to supporting software updates on the initial hardware version for the next 10-20 years?</td></tr>
<tr><td>158</td><td>Didn't think so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>159</td><td>Other than Saudi princes and the people on Sprint's "Stupid Rich" commercials, who is going to sink $15k into something that's going to be unsupported in 4-5 years?</td></tr>
<tr><td>160</td><td>It's ridiculous, no matter what it can do now, but I guess if I had a garage full gold-plated Mercedes then I'd probably get one of these, too, just because why not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>161</td><td>@Timothy D. Naegele You are certainly an iSheep.Apple certainly did get to be successful by getting people to buy the latest version of something they don't really need.</td></tr>
<tr><td>162</td><td>@Timothy D. Naegele You are certainly an iSheep.</td></tr>

<tr><td>166</td><td>I am sure the sheep will line up in droves for this worthless piece of technology and they will go to the ends of the earth to justify their purchase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>167</td><td>I'll keep my mechanical time piece that doesn't require a nightly recharge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>168</td><td>@Robert Ragan , I agree, mechanical watches are timeless.Apple Watch has a five year life cycle.It will be worthless in five years, a mechanical watch will still be ticking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>169</td><td>@Robert Ragan , I agree, mechanical watches are timeless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>170</td><td>Apple Watch has a five year life cycle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>171</td><td>It will be worthless in five years, a mechanical watch will still be ticking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>172</td><td>I don't see this is an replacement to mechanical watch, just a gadget to use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>173</td><td>If watch is a piece of art, I don't understand the logic why men cannot wear two watches (like any jewelries) at a time like multiple paintings in home or office.Afterall, human has two limps and two ears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>174</td><td>Feel free to wear two watches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>175</td><td>Free free also to put ketchup on your hot dog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>176</td><td>Is it possible that telling time in an elegant way is more important than the collection of things that the Apple watch does in a half-baked way?</td></tr>
<tr><td>177</td><td>(I guess I know the answer among those who never use their telephones to make a call.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>178</td><td>Another silly piece written by someone who really hasn't lived his life yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>179</td><td>Back when photography became available many people said that that spelled the end of painting as a way to capture an image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>180</td><td>How foolish that was then, and how foolish now to contemplate that an electronic watch (again) will make a hand crafted, finished mechanical watch obsolete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>181</td><td>They will coexist and I believe it may actually help the mechanical watch industry as people who have never worn a watch get used to having one on their wrist, and when they move up in the world start admiring what a true hand finished mechanical watch can do for their enjoyment of the finer things in life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>182</td><td>Reading the comments reminds me of the debate when golden-eared audiophiles poo-poo'd the notion of buying CDs over vinyl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>183</td><td>There will always be those aficionados who only buy the best or most expensive, they'll never go extinct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>184</td><td>However, as an antique collector, who sees lots of Pateks and other very fine old watches go up for auction, I can assure you those watches you revere are not "eternal" as Mr. Biver, keeps saying, otherwise they wouldn't be up for auction, nor would you have to see if the timepiece worked, and whether it could be brought back to life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>185</td><td>And, as one of the collectors at the end of the article noted, they'll probably get an Apple Watch too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>186</td><td>When you have a dozen or more high-end watches, another pricy watch is not such a big deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>187</td><td>""I don't believe [the Apple Watch] will affect the Hublots and Breitlings and Pateks," said Jean-Claude Biver, who is president of LVMH's watch division and CEO of its brand Tag Heuer. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>188</td><td>He's right, the Apple Watch won't affect the top of the market like Pateks, but it will affect the level right below, like the brand Biver is in charge of, Tag Heuers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>189</td><td>"Apple Watches will almost certainly never be heirloom pieces, no matter how much gold they are carved from, because, like your iPhone and MacBook, they will inevitably become obsolete."</td></tr>
<tr><td>190</td><td>Interestingly, we don't know that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>191</td><td>The SOC is modular, and there's only one reason for doing that, easy replaceability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>192</td><td>It doesn't take too much imagining to realize that the Watch is upgradeable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>193</td><td>" Tag Heuer announced a partnership with Silicon Valley stalwarts Google and Intel to collaborate on a smartwatch that will be unveiled later this year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>194</td><td>Frankenwatch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>195</td><td>So a rich person is going to have an Android phone to partner with their Tag?</td></tr>
<tr><td>196</td><td>Have you seen one?</td></tr>
<tr><td>197</td><td>@Bryan Lopez @Ken Cheng Stand in line?What for?I ordered two already and they'll be delivered on April 24th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>198</td><td>You know, I've been buying Apple products since 1987, back when it was not popular at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>199</td><td>And, I'd rather people like you buy the Apple Watch, as I'd like to see my 20,000 shares go up some more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>200</td><td>@Ken Cheng Stand in line Ken - Apple wants and needs people like you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>201</td><td>At the moment Apple have millions of iSheep - like you - that will happily pay big dollars for anything with an Apple logo to be part of the "in crowd" as well as champion their cause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>202</td><td>@Ken Cheng 20,000 shares eh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>203</td><td>Where is your hand Ken?</td></tr>
<tr><td>204</td><td>Apple watch,limited resale value( if any).</td></tr>
<tr><td>205</td><td>compared to a good Swiss watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>206</td><td>People who buy fine watches do so to reflect their personality, enjoy the craftsmanship and as a mark of their success in life, not for its resale value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>207</td><td>I don't think you can separate the two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>208</td><td>The resale value is driven by the personality and craftsmanship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>209</td><td>If the Apple Watch does what it is supposed to do, allow me to keep in touch with text, emails, phone calls, etc... without constantly pulling out a smartphone and reading it while walking down the street, waiting for the subway, or riding the subway for that matter, like a great many of the people who live and work in the major metro areas I live, work, and visit, it won't be too long before I pick up an affordable version of the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>210</td><td>As for spending more than $500 for any watch or piece of jewlery I wear, well I will wait until President Hillary enacts a minimum $70,000 annual wage before I shell out that type of cash for me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>211</td><td>Technology is not for technology's sake.It is about return on investment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>212</td><td>after buying the watch: You could have opted for a real investment-- a remote control deadbolt smart lock.</td></tr>
