<h3>Netanyahu: There?s ?huge, worldwide effort? to defeat me in election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Army Radio, which aired what it said were comments he made on Monday to activists of his right-wing Likud party, interpreted them as referring to foreign funding for advocacy groups campaigning for a change of government in Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Political parties in Israel are banned from accepting money directly from overseas donors during an election campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But such funding is allowed under Israeli law for non-profit organizations espousing political viewpoints, and US consultants have advised Israeli candidates for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It is a very tight race. Nothing is guaranteed because there is a huge, worldwide effort to topple the Likud government," said Netanyahu, who received rousing applause in the US Congress last week during a speech against a potential nuclear deal with Iran sought by the administration of President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The visit came at the invitation of the Republican leadership of Congress, angering the White House and Democratic legislators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Critics accused Netanyahu of intervening in US politics, and the Republicans of trying to boost his re-election prospects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Likud and the center-left Zionist Union are running neck and neck in opinion polls ahead of the March 17 ballot, with Netanyahu widely seen by political commentators as having a better chance of forming a governing coalition after the vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As election day approaches, "Netanyahu is feeling the pressure & he is shooting in all directions," Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog told Israel Radio.</td></tr>
