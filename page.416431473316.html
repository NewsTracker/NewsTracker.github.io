<h3>Morrison's 'God Help the Child' excavates characters' self-image with a touch of magical realism</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In 1970 Toni Morrison detonated a beautiful atom bomb of a debut novel called"The Bluest Eye."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In telling the story of Pecola Breedlove, a little Ohio girl taught to hate her black skin, Morrison laid bare society's poisonous obsession with racial appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She also introduced a theme that would run throughout her body of work, including her latest short novel,"God Help the Child": the combustive combination of love and hate so integral to African-American self-image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Morrison is now 84, and apparently drinking from the same fountain of youth that sustained her only rival for the title of Greatest Living American Writer, Philip Roth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"God Help the Child," her 11th novel, bristles with the high colloquial style that infused her first several novels, before her work took a decidedly modernist (and often challenging) turn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It reads more like"Sula"and"Song of Solomon"than"Jazz"or"Paradise"(or her crowning masterpiece,"Beloved").</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Like"Bluest Eye"'sPecola,"Child"'sBride is made to feel ashamed of her pitch-black skin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Bride's mother, Sweetness, sounds the alarm on the novel's first page: "She was so black she scared me. Midnight black, Sudanese black ... tar is the closest I can think of yet her hair don't go with the skin. It's different - straight but curly like those naked tribes in Australia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Sweetness is one of five first-person narrators (plus a third-person omniscient voice) guiding this vessel, each of them identified at the top of each chapter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Morrison knows her Faulkner and her"As I Lay Dying."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bride, however, flips the"Bluest Eye"script.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A rising manager for a boutique cosmetics company, she wears white to set off the beauty of her blackness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Every feature," thinks her lover, "the ledge of her cheekbones, her invitational mouth, her nose, her forehead, chin, as well as those eyes - was more aesthetically pleasing because of her obsidian-midnight skin."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Bride still has her crosses to bear, chiefly a lie she told as a little girl that destroyed a woman's life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>And she still suffers from an inability to love healthily, a theme that haunts other characters here and in Morrison's body of work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It's as hard as ever to pick nits in Morrison's writing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Every page contains at least one passage of breathtaking prose, a lyrical flow accentuated by stark imagery and laden with poetic contrasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Here's Bride's lover, the peripatetic Booker, identifying the remains of his brother as a child: "Filthy, rat-gnawed, with a single open eye socket. The maggots, overfed and bursting with glee, had gone home leaving fastidiously clean bones under the strips of his mud-caked yellow T-shirt."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Morrison has always had the command to render the most horrific scenes with uncompromising splendor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>To her, it's all part of life and death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>You'll also find a touch of what could be called Morrison's magical realism, a term that has always felt a little trite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>There's no reincarnation, as in"Beloved," or humans taking "Song of Solomonflight."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Instead, as Bride finds herself reckoning with her past, she physically reverts to childhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Morrison remains deeply imaginative in depicting the historical ravaging of the black body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In her work this is never merely a physical matter, but a symptom and reminder of the country's bloodstained past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The protest novel, of course, has never been Morrison's thing; she's more interested in excavating her characters' interior lives, and their ancestral connections to the worlds of history and myth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Her heroes and villains, separated by a thin membrane, follow Joan Didion's dictum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>They tell themselves stories in order to live, to make better sense of past pains, and their urgency gives their tales a sense of brave desperation undercut with shame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In Morrison's universe, shame is never far away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>My only complaint with"God Help the Child"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>I wish there were more of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Like her previous novel,"Home"in 2013,"God Help the Child"checks in under 200 pages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>If it were anyone else we'd just call it a novella, but the word seems to belittle Morrison's stature and gift.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The writing is crisp, the narrative economical, and a new Morrison book is always cause for celebration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>But some of the late-breaking plot developments feel orphaned by the novel's brevity and eagerness to bring Bride's denouement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Then again, the last word, which goes to Sweetness, will ring in your ears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>It carries echoes of"Beloved"and the potent brew of burden, fear and pride that goes into motherhood, and bringing another being into this most imperfect of worlds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>God help the child, indeed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>By all accounts Morrison is in fine health, and the words are clearly still there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Yet we know she's closer to the end than the beginning, and"God Help the Child"feels a bit like the closing of a circle begun with Pecola and that first novel 45 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>This time the sadness and unflagging wisdom is cut with hope - not the promise that anything will be easy, but the suggestion that it will at least be all right.</td></tr>
