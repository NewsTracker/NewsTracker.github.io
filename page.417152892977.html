<h3>Smith, James lead Cavs past Hawks 97-89 in Game 1 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATLANTA (AP) -- J.R. Smith knocked down a tough 3-pointer, then another.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Turning toward the fans, their heckling transformed to groans, he blew off his right index finger and motioned toward his side, like he was holstering his pistol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yep, Smith was that hot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While LeBron James led Cleveland with 31 points, it was Smith who ignited the Cavaliers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He made eight 3-pointers and scored 28 points in a 97-89 victory over the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Intent on bringing Cleveland its first NBA title, James sealed the victory with a soaring dunk in the final minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For the Hawks, it was the second straight series in which they've lost the opening game at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cleveland will look to take command of the series in Game 2 Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Making matters worse for Atlanta, DeMarre Carroll went down with a knee injury driving to the basket with 4:59 remaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was helped to the locker room, not putting any weight on his left leg, and will undergo an MRI on Thursday to determine the seriousness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Besides being the main defender on James, Carroll had been the Hawks' leading scorer in the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He was averaging more than 17 points coming into Atlanta's first conference final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''DeMarre is a complete player,'' Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Jeff Teague led Atlanta with 27 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But Atlanta didn't produce its usual balanced scoring, as two starters - Kyle Korver and Carroll - failed to reach double figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>With Smith doing most of the damage, Cleveland outscored the Hawks 22-4 over the final 5 minutes of the third quarter and the first 2 minutes of the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>During that span, he made five 3-pointers and another jumper from just inside the arc, as well as throwing up a lob that Tristan Thompson dunked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Smith has been a huge addition for the Cavaliers since he was acquired in January as part of a three-team trade with New York and Oklahoma City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A player once known for his selfishness, he had learned to work with within the confines of a team led by James.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>When the Cavaliers really needed Smith in Game 1, he seemed to make every shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Cleveland scored the first 11 points of the final period - all but two on 3s by Smith - for its biggest lead, 85-67.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Carroll's injury silenced the raucous crowd and would be a tough blow for the Hawks to overcome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>While he was being taken off, James came over to say a few words and pat the injured player on the head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''We're all a brotherhood,'' James said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Even without Carroll, Atlanta closed to 91-87 with about a minute remaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But James got loose from Paul Millsap out near the arc, took off down the lane uncontested and slammed home a dunk that finished off the Hawks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Having made their deepest run in the playoffs since 1970, the Hawks carried that momentum to a nine-point lead in the opening quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Atlanta shot 61 percent and James went to the bench with about 3 minutes remaining in the period after picking up his second foul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Cleveland's dominance on the boards kept Atlanta from pulling away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Cleveland outrebounded the Hawks 15-6 over the first 12 minutes, actually yanking down more offensive rebounds (seven) than Atlanta's total output.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>James returned in the second quarter and began to take control of the Cleveland offense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He scored 14 points in the period on 7-of-9 shooting, taking advantage when the Hawks tried to bait him into a third foul by guarding him with smaller players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The game was tied 51-all at the half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Cavaliers finished with a 49-37 rebounding edge, exposing Atlanta's major weakness during the regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Timofey Mozgov led with 11 rebounds, while Thompson chipped in with 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>James also had eight rebounds, giving the Cavaliers three players who had more than anyone on the Hawks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Millsap, Kyle Korver and Al Horford each had seven for Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Cavaliers: This was the first time in franchise history that Cleveland won Game 1 of a playoff series on the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The Cavs had been 0-14.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>... Thompson had 14 points, while Mozgov and Iman Shumpert added 10 apiece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Hawks: Horford had 16 points, Millsap 13 and Kent Bazemore 10, including a massive dunk in the second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>... Bazemore figures to get even more playing time if Carroll is sidelined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>... Floyd Mayweather Jr. was sitting courtside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>When he was shown on the video board, most of the crowd booed.</td></tr>
