<h3>The Reason Behind the Subtle Facebook Icon Change</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Caitlin Winner, a design manager at Facebook, was inspired to update some of the icons used on the website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Facebook has found another way for women to lean in with a subtle redesign of its friends icons, bringing the female silhouette to the forefront.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Caitlin Winner, a design manager at Facebook, said she was struck by how the female was in the background on both the friends and groups icons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She also noticed the woman had a chip on her shoulder -- an area where the male icon was placed in front of her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"As a woman, educated at a women's college, it was hard not to read into the symbolism of the current icon; the woman was quite literally in the shadow of the man, she was not in a position to lean in," Winner wrote in a post on Medium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And so she got to work, playing with a few ideas, including a double silhouette and another with two equally sized people appearing to be side by side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Dozens of iterations later, I abandoned this approach after failing to make an icon that didn't look like a two headed mythical beast," she said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>Finally she decided to place the woman, whose silhouette is slightly smaller, in front of the man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She didn't stop there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The woman's "Darth Vader-like helmet" hairstyle was replaced with a more "shapely bob."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The man wasn't left out either, though and received a modern makeover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Winner said she "smoothed down his hair and added a slight slope to his shoulders."</td></tr>
