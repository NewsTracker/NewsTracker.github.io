<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple says some customers will be getting the new Apple Watch sooner than expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Many who ordered the new smartwatch online earlier this month were told that delivery could take a month or longer, although Apple has promised to begin deliveries Friday to those who were among the first to place orders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Apple Inc. is now contacting some customers who were originally told to expect a lengthy wait time and letting them know their watches could arrive sooner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Customers who place new orders are still facing a wait of several weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple hasn't said how many watches have been sold since it began taking orders April 10, but it's filling orders in the order they were received.</td></tr>
