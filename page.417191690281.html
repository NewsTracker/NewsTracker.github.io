<h3>Clinton emails show concern about image after Benghazi</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clinton emails show concern about image after Benghazi Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Top aides to former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton fretted over how she would be portrayed after the 2012 Benghazi attacks that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, emails released on Friday showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The emails from Clinton's personal email account made public by the State Department do not appear to contain any revelations that could badly damage her bid for the presidency in 2016 or provide fodder for Republicans who accuse her of being negligent before the Benghazi attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But they offer a glimpse into how Clinton's team was concerned about her image immediately afterward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A senior adviser to Clinton forwarded a fawning email from a State Department official about positive media coverage of a statement she gave on Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>12, 2012, the day after the killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Really nice work guys," State Department official Matthew Walsh said in the email to other staffers, which linked to a story on the Slate news site praising Clinton's comments about Benghazi as "eloquent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He forwarded the email to Clinton with the letters "FYI."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In another email from September 2012, Sullivan assured the secretary of state that she had used the correct language to describe the lead-up to the Benghazi attack by Islamist militants on a U.S. diplomatic compound and CIA base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>U.S. officials' exact wording of the attacker's motivation had become important because the Obama administration initially said the assaults were a spontaneous protest against an anti-Islamic film posted on the Internet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations at the time, Susan Rice, drew heavy criticism from Republicans for defending this view on Sunday TV shows, even though intelligence indicated within hours that the attacks were the carefully planned work of Islamist militia members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sullivan assured Clinton that her language when discussing the attacks in public had been correct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"You never said spontaneous or characterized the motives, in fact you were careful in your first statement to say we were assessing motive and method," he wrote in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Long a focus of Republican investigators in Congress, accusations that Clinton was negligent on Benghazi are putting her under more intense scrutiny now that she is running for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2016 presidential election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Republicans say the Obama administration was lax about the security of U.S. personnel in Libya and then misled the public about the nature of the attacks, but various congressional probes have produced little damaging evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The 296 pages of Clinton emails from her time as secretary of state between 2009 and 2013 that were released on Friday were the first installment of a rolling release of 55,000 pages of emails ordered by a federal judge on Tuesday.</td></tr>
