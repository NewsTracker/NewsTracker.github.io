<h3>Boko Haram Attacks Nigerian Town, Kills 11</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Resident Mohammed Umara said Cameroonian forces immediately crossed the border when gunfire erupted Wednesday evening and drove the militants from Gamboru-Ngala.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We were terrified when we started hearing gunshots echoing ... but everywhere became calm about an hour later. The soldiers informed us that it was the Boko Haram terrorists that came back", said Aji Kaumi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He and Mohammed Umara said 11 civilians were killed on the outskirts of Gamboru.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They and other fearful residents have crossed back to the relative safety of the Cameroonian town of Fotokol, from which they spoke to The Associated Press by telephone Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was the first reported attack on a town previously occupied by Boko Haram since a regional offensive was launched by troops from Chad seven weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nigerian officials this week said they have taken back 38 northeastern towns and forced Boko Haram out of two of three states and freed most of Borno state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The extremists had seized Gamboru in November and were dislodged Feb. 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The offensive comes as Nigerians prepare for a closely contested March 28 presidential election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nigeria says the multinational push aims to eradicate Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But a French diplomat says a more realistic goal is to reduce Boko Haram to what it used to be - an extremist group holding no territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The high-ranking diplomatic briefed journalists in Paris on condition of anonymity earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>France brought about the regional cooperation with a summit in Paris last year that eased strained relations between Nigeria and its smaller, francophone neighbors amid growing concern as Boko Haram began launching attacks across Nigeria's borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>France has sent military advisers to Niger and its Chadian-based aircraft are on scouting missions to help the effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The death toll from the nearly six-year Islamic uprising mounted exponentially last year with some 10,000 people killed and more than 1.5 million driven from their homes, according to the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations.</td></tr>

<h3>Tunis gunmen trained with Libyan militia, says security chief</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"They left the country illegally last December for Libya and they were able to train with weapons there," Rafik Chelly told the private Al Hiwar Ettounsi television channel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The gunmen, killed by security forces, were named by officials as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaoui.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chelly said Laabidi had been arrested before he went to Libya, without providing details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Wednesday's attack on the Bardo museum in the centre of the capital was the country's worst since the 2011 uprising that toppled the then president, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The security secretary said the gunmen were from sleeper cells that were present in several areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We know they can launch operations but we must piece together clues in order to conduct an arrest," Chelly said late on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He named the locations of several suspected training camps for Tunisians in Libya, including Benghazi and the coastal town of Derna, which has become a stronghold for jihadis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In an audio statement posted online on Thursday, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, describing the museum, which houses a world-famous collection of Roman mosaics, as a "den of infidels and vice".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The attack was just "the first drop of rain", the Associated Press quoted the group as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The gunmen were feted as "knights" armed with assault rifles and grenades and the group seemed to suggest that further strikes would follow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Although Tunisia is often described as the only success story of the Arab spring, up to 3,000 Tunisians have gone to Syria to fight, more than from any other Arab nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Several thousand more have been prevented from making the same journey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Al-Qaida has been around for more than a decade, using different names, and the appeal of Isis has been growing recently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There is no information yet on what type of contacts Laabidi and Khachnaoui had with Isis, or how the group came to claim responsibility for the attack; none of the group's statements are direct messages from the gunmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Facing the prospect of a collapse in tourism, a pillar of Tunisia's troubled economy, President Beji Caid Essebsi ordered troops on to the streets on Thursday - the first time since the 2011 revolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Armoured cars and roadblocks appeared across Tunis, while security forces announced nine arrests in a sweep of terror suspects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, was travelling to Tunis on a pre-scheduled visit on Friday to coincide with the country's Independence Day holiday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Witnesses said Wednesday's attack came without warning, as two buses bringing Italian tourists to the museum stopped by the main entrance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The gunmen, who had been waiting in the forecourt near the front gates, opened fire on the buses with machine guns, then sprinted for the glass doors of the museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While the adjacent military base and national parliament are the most heavily guarded sites in Tunisia, there was no police presence in the museum itself, and the gunmen began shooting as they entered the large foyer.</td></tr>
