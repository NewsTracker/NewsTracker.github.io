<h3>Duke guard Tyus Jones latest Blue Devil to enter NBA draft (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Coach Mike Krzyzewski announced the guard's decision Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was selected as the most outstanding player at the Final Four after averaging 13 points and 4.5 assists in six NCAA Tournament games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He led all scorers with 23 in the national championship matchup against Wisconsin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It's been a busy week for freshmen heading to the pros: In the past seven days, Jones' Duke classmates Jahlil Okafor and Justise Winslow declared themselves draft-eligible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Seven Kentucky players also have entered the draft and three of them were freshmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>None of the departures from Duke was much of a surprise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jones is the eighth Duke player to head to the pros after his freshman season and the sixth since 2011 - joining a group that includes Kyrie Irving, Austin Rivers and Jabari Parker in addition to his two teammates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Among the most prominent freshmen entering the June 25 draft were those trios from Duke and Kentucky - which had freshmen forwards Karl-Anthony Towns and Trey Lyles and backup guard Devin Booker jump to the pros - plus Texas center Myles Turner and Kansas forwards Kelly Oubre and Cliff Alexander.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Childhood friends Jones and Okafor were among the nation's highest-rated high school players at their positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They held a nationally televised joint ceremony in November 2013 from their respective schools in Minnesota and Chicago to announced their decisions to play for the Blue Devils.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One of the big questions before this season was how Jones and senior Quinn Cook would coexist in the backcourt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Jones became just the second Duke freshman with 400 points and 200 assists, finishing with averages of 11.5 points and 5.7 assists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>His assist-to-turnover ratio of 2.86 to 1 was a school record for freshmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Krzyzewski said Jones projects as a first-round pick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''He's going to get a lot better, but people have already seen him and know how he handles himself, especially in pressure situations and in the biggest games,'' Krzyzewski said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''He comes through like a champion!</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>I loved coaching him, and I believe he'll be an outstanding professional.</td></tr>
