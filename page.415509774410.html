<h3>Jodi Arias ?Juror 17? fires back at critics after mistrial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The infamous "Juror 17" claimed in her first televised interview the death threats are rolling in and she's under 24-hour police protection after casting the lone vote to save the life of Arizona boyfriend killer Jodi Arias.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Enraged case watchers turned on the 33-year-old holdout, spewing conspiracy theories, as soon as the 11-1 vote was announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I feel like I'm being judged," the woman told NBC News 12 in an exclusive interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I didn't ask for this. I just showed up for jury duty."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The juror, whose face was obscured on camera, claims she lives in fear of obsessives who wanted to see Arias put to death for the 2008 murder of ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The unpopular decision resulted in a second mistrial in the penalty phase of the high-profile case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Arias - who stabbed Alexander, slit his throat and shot him in the head - was convicted in 2013 of first-degree murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She's now facing life in prison after two juries couldn't agree on the death penalty for the diminutive butcher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Other jurors tried to boot Juror 17 off the second panel, alleging she was "ineffective in deliberating" and had watched a made-for-TV drama about the murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Prosecutor Juan Martinez also lobbied against the woman because she'd followed Facebook pages of news stations and firebrand commentator Nancy Grace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Conspiracy theories raged online when web sleuths unearthed her name and learned Martinez had prosecuted her ex-husband for robbery 15 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Theorists suspected the woman was a "stealth juror" who took revenge on Martinez by blocking his bid to put Arias to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The woman had previously disclosed her ex-husband's troubles and the criminal history of her current husband, who'd served time before they were together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She now claims she didn't remember Martinez from the earlier case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Even if she had, she only blames her ex for her past trouble, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"My struggles and my frustrations were always directed towards him," the woman told News 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It's preposterous to me to hold a grudge or to blame somebody for doing their job."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As for Arias, she claimed she never had much interest in the trial until she was called to serve on the jury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It didn't really hit her until the first day when she saw the 34-year-old killer in the courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"From that very moment I was like, 'Oh my God," she told News 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I want to say that I was shaking even. The seriousness of the matter hit me right away."</td></tr>

<h3>Americans exposed to Ebola return for monitoring</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>None is known to be infected with the disease, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman Tom Skinner said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The returning workers are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They all had contact with a colleague who's been diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The heath care worker with Ebola was in critical condition Monday, the NIH said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That changed from the NIH saying on Friday that the patient was in serious condition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Details about the patient's identity weren't released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While in West Africa, the workers "came to the aid of their ailing colleague," according to a Partners in Health statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As the CDC investigates who else might have had contact with the Ebola patient, more workers might be flown back to the United States, according to Skinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The workers are being housed near hospitals that specialize in treating Ebola patients, and if they show signs of the disease, they'll be admitted as patients -- as was the case with one worker in Nebraska.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The person developed symptoms Sunday evening and "out of an abundance of caution" was taken to the biocontainment unit at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"At this point, this person has not tested positive for the Ebola virus," Phil Smith, M.D., medical director of the unit, said in a statement Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"However, because of a change in symptoms, we decided the most prudent course of action was to bring the individual to the Biocontainment Unit, where we can better monitor symptoms and safely perform testing. However, some of the symptoms which prompted the move to the Biocontainment Unit have resolved this morning."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The first of these workers arrived Friday night in Atlanta showing possible signs of Ebola, but testing over the weekend came back negative, according to a government official who did not want to be named.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The worker is being isolated in housing near Emory University Hospital for 21 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Twice a day, we'll have visual monitoring, either face to face or we'll Skype with them, or do FaceTime," said Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"And if it's Skype or FaceTime, they'll have to be in a place where we can clearly identify that they are where they're supposed to be."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The next set of aid workers returned back to the United States on Saturday evening and went into isolation in housing on the campus of the University of Nebraska Medical Center, according to spokesman Taylor Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As in Atlanta, these workers have voluntarily agreed not to leave their housing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"They will be monitored so they'll stay there," Wilson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Another set of three workers arrived Sunday morning at housing near the National Institutes of Health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>These workers will have more freedom to move around than the ones in Georgia and Nebraska.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>According to Christopher Garrett, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Health, his state will follow the CDC's guidelines, which forbid monitored individuals from getting on public transportation but allow them to go outside as long as they stay at least 3 feet away from other people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>More workers arrived Monday morning in Atlanta and were isolated in housing near Emory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The patient now at NIH is the second with Ebola admitted to the NIH hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Nina Pham, a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, was admitted to NIH in October after she contracted the disease while treating Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Pham recovered and was released free of disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Duncan died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Emory, the NIH and Nebraska are three of only four hospitals in the United States that have biocontainment units to deal with a highly infectious disease such as Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>More than 10,000 people have died in a West African epidemic of Ebola that dates back to December 2013, according to the World Health Organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Almost all of the deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.</td></tr>
