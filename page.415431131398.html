<h3>NYSE ex-manager sues over firing after 'Daily Show' appearance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a lawsuit filed Thursday in California state court, Todd Wilemon says his supervisors at Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE), which owns NYSE and other financial exchanges, had allowed him to appear on Fox News, Al Jazeera and other television stations without receiving permission in each instance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After appearing in a 2014 segment about the Affordable Care Act on the popular Comedy Central show without permission, however, Wilemon was promptly fired, the suit says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He claims that while he knew the interview would be edited to poke fun at his opposition to "Obamacare," he thought it would be an effective way to draw attention to controversies surrounding the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An ICE representative, also speaking for the New York Stock Exchange, declined to comment on the suit on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The March 6, 2014 segment of "The Daily Show" challenged the notion that the U.S. has the best health care system in the world, with Wilemon, a managing director for ICE from 2009 to 2014, playing the foil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His comments, particularly his exhortation that "if you're poor, stop being poor," were widely criticized by left-leaning websites and news outlets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The popular website AlterNet, for example, placed Wilemon at the top of a list of "8 colossal jackasses from the right-wing fringe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Before he was fired, Wilemon provided information to investors and firms listed on the NYSE's exchanges, as well as making regular television appearances to discuss investing and politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Days after the segment aired, Wilemon's supervisors chided him for "mocking the one percent," according to the suit, and he was fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The suit says his termination violated a California labor law that prohibits employers from curbing workers' participation in politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>His firing was "due to defendants' own antipathy for the political message of The Daily Show, which is widely regarded as an influential progressive political platform," Wilemon's suit says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Wilemon is seeking at least $150,000 in damages under California law, but not reinstatement to his job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Wilemon's lawyer, Richard Levine, didn't immediately return a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The case is Wilemon v.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Intercontinental Exchange Inc, California Superior Court, San Francisco County, No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>15-544667.</td></tr>

<h3>Pope Francis: Devil is punishing Mexico with violence</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY - The devil is punishing Mexico with criminal violence, Pope Francis said, just a few weeks after the Mexican government complained that the Pontiff had stigmatized the country as a breeding ground for gangland chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I think the devil is punishing Mexico with great fury," the 78-year-old Francis told Mexican television in an interview broadcast late on Thursday when discussing the disappearance and apparent massacre of 43 Mexican students last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Arguing that the devil was angry with Mexico for its Christian faith, Francis said "everyone had to put their back into resolving" the criminal malaise afflicting the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mexico, a strongly Roman Catholic nation, has been wracked by drug violence in the past decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>More than 100,000 people have died in clashes between Mexican drug gangs and their battles with security forces over the last eight years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Last month, a spat flared up when a private email sent by the Pope was published in which he expressed concern about the "Mexicanization" of Argentina with drug gang violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mexico quickly sent a letter of protest to the Vatican, which said it had not meant to offend the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Clearly it is a technical term. It has nothing to do with the dignity of Mexico. Like when we talk about Balkanization, neither the Serbs, nor Macedonians nor Croats get angry," Francis said, referring to his use of the word Mexicanization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The disappearance of the 43 trainee teachers in the southwestern city of Iguala in late September sparked international condemnation of the security situation in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mexico said the young men were abducted by corrupt police, handed over to a local drug gang, then incinerated, triggering President Enrique Pena Nieto's deepest political crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Francis also said in the interview he believes his pontificate will be short and that he would be ready to resign like his predecessor rather than rule for life.</td></tr>
