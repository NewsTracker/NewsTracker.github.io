<h3>Pakistan judge orders charges against ex-CIA lawyer over drone deaths</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Pakistani judge on Tuesday ordered criminal charges to be filed against a former CIA lawyer who oversaw the agency's drone program and a former station chief in Islamabad over a 2009 strike that killed two people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Former acting general counsel John A. Rizzo and ex-station chief Jonathan Bank must face charges including murder, conspiracy, waging war against Pakistan and terrorism, Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui of the Islamabad High Court ruled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A court clerk and a lawyer involved in the case, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, confirmed details of the judge's ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Rizzo and Bank could not be immediately reached for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The CIA declined to comment when contacted by Al Jazeera America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bank's cover was blown in late 2010 when a Pakistani man named Kareem Khan initially threatened to sue the CIA and others for $500 million over the deaths of his 18-year-old son, Zaenullah Khan, and his brother, Asif Iqbal, in a purported Dec. 31, 2009, strike on the North Waziristan tribal region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Associated Press and other media reported at the time that three people were killed in a missile attack that day in Mir Ali in North Waziristan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Pakistani intelligence officials said then that the men were insurgents, but offered no proof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As the outrage over the deaths grew, protesters in Islamabad began carrying placards bearing Bank's name, as listed in the lawsuit, and urging him to leave the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The CIA pulled Bank from the country on December 16, 2010, when he began receiving death threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The station chief's outing spurred questions at the time of whether Pakistan's spy service might have leaked the information, something Islamabad denied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The disclosure didn't prevent Bank from landing another sensitive job: He became chief of the Iran operations division at CIA headquarters at Langley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He later was removed from that post after CIA officials concluded he created a hostile work environment in the division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He has since been detailed to the Pentagon's intelligence arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Rizzo was the CIA's acting general counsel overseeing its drone program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He later left the agency and wrote a book about his experiences at the CIA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The CIA's drone strike program killed Pakistani Taliban fighters and other insurgents hiding in its tribal regions, but has also sparked anger across Pakistan over civilian casualties from the strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Since 2004, the U.S. has carried out over 400 suspected drone strikes in the country, killing anywhere between 421 and 960 civilians, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which tracks the U.S. campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The foundation says the last U.S. drone strike in Pakistan occurred on Jan. 29 and killed at least six suspected fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It is not clear how the judge's ruling will affect relations between Pakistan and the U.S., especially over the drone program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>While Pakistan's government often decries the strikes, many believe it allows them to target the insurgents that threaten it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Massive protests against the drone program previously have blocked a land route used by NATO forces to resupply troops in neighboring Afghanistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Any legal action stands no chance of success unless U.S. officials cooperate with the court, something highly unlikely given the secretive nature of the missile strike program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The CIA rarely publicly discusses its drone program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Pakistani police officials could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Pakistani lawyer Khawaja Naveed Ahmed, who is not involved in the case, said the government also could appeal the judge's order to a higher court to try and stop having to file the charges.</td></tr>
