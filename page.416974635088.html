<h3>Case mounts against Russians in MH17 crash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A new report has presented detailed evidence linking a Russian military convoy to the Buk missile launcher believed to have brought down MH17, killing all 298 people on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The report by Bellingcat includes photos taken by a Russian soldier and driver that detail the journey of a large Russian military convoy that travelled to eastern Ukraine in June 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Malaysia Airlines flight crashed on July 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Published overnight, the report presents detailed evidence of the involvement of the 2nd and 147th Automobile Battalions in the transport of military equipment through Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That equipment includes the Buk missile launcher filmed and photographed in Ukraine on July 17 and linked to the downing of MH17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>An earlier Bellingcat report alleged that Buk 3x2 was seen in a convoy travelling from the Russian 53rd Brigade near Kursk to Millerovo, close to the Ukrainian border, between June 23 and June 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The new report includes evidence from a Russian soldier, Dmitry Zubov, who posted pictures on the social media site VKontakte of the convoy that show dates and the route it took into Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Zubov's social media site has since been deleted, but a cache of his posts was saved by a InformNapalm, a pro-Ukraine group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The claims made by InformNapalm included in the Bellingcat report have not been verified, but information has been passed on to the Dutch team investigating the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The 2nd Automobile Battalion (Unit 11385) and/or the 147th Automobile Battalion (Unit 83466) were/was involved in transporting the Buk related to the downing of MH17, Buk 3x2 (in the 23-25 June convoy)," the Bellingcat report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The 23-25 June Buk convoy went to the Millerovo military airbase and from there the Buk missile launchers were moved to several different locations along the border. Buk 3x2 was transported via the M4 highway to Donetsk, Russia, and subsequently crossed the border through a field south of Severniy during the night of 16 to 17 July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"After the downing of MH17, the same Buk missile launcher crossed the border again at the same location in the early morning of 18 July 2014."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The report alleges that Zubov was the driver of a truck that hauled another Buk in the June convoy, which was travelling in front of Buk 3x2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Zubov returned to Russia before July 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Eliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, told Radio Free Europe that the information released by InformNapalm matched findings by his group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We've been looking at this same convoy and there's quite a lot of interesting information," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We've got the names of the people who were in the convoy. We've got a good idea of which vehicles they were driving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"In fact, the guy who they feature in the article was actually almost certainly driving just one vehicle in front of the actual missile launcher that (we believe) shot down MH17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"There was a big, massive movement of equipment between June 23 and June 25, including the missile launcher that (we believe) shot down MH17, and a few weeks later we see it in Ukraine on July 17."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Malaysia Airlines flight was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Thirty-eight Australians were killed.</td></tr>
