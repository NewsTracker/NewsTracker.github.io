<h3>Greek parliament approves ?85bn bailout deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A majority of Greek MPs have approved the country's third international bailout after an all-night debate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had earlier urged the chamber to approve the deal "to assure the country's ability to survive and keep on fighting."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Thanks to opposition support, Mr Tsipras easily managed to cross the 151-vote threshold in the 300-seat chamber to pass the bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, Mr Tsipras has been forced to announce a confidence vote after one third of his radical left Syriza members voted against the measures following a stormy all night debate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It eventually passed with 222 votes, but 43 MPs - or nearly a third of deputies from Mr Tspiras' party - voted against or abstained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A government official said Mr Tsipras is to seek a confidence vote after 20 August when a 3.2bn debt payment to the European Central Bank falls due.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Eurozone finance ministers are expected to approve the vital aid for Greece later today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The European Commission responded very positively to the Greek vote and said that agreement on a third bailout at the meeting of eurozone finance ministers was "entirely feasible".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The positive response from the European Commission was backed up further optimism from Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Chair of the Eurogroup of Finance Ministers who will steer the key meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He praised Greek negotiators for "being far more constructive than before".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But he did say that all 18 eurozone finance ministers still had to agree on the bailout, a suggestion that Germany still harbours reservations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If Greece defaults on this debt, the ECB is likely to halt emergency funding for Greece's crippled banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Athens was forced to close Greek banks for three weeks and even now capital controls severely limiting withdrawals and payments aboard remain, badly hurting the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Greece's conservative opposition New Democracy party has confirmed it will not back the government in the confidence vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>MP Makis Voridis said: "New Democracy giving the government a vote of confidence? There is no chance of that".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Tsipras earlier told MPs he does not regret deciding to compromise with creditors and the bailout agreement is a necessary choice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He added that a German proposal to provide a bridging loan would be "a return to crisis without end".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Even after the Greek vote, the bailout deal could still face hurdles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The IMF made clear it would participate in the programme only if Europe agreed to ease Greece's huge debt burden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Tsipras has long argued Greece cannot repay all its debts and demanded a partial write-off.</td></tr>
