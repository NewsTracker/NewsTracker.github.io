<h3>Thousands wait for Vanuatu relief</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australian and French troops arrived on the South Pacific nation's hard-hit island of Tanna, where shaken residents were still waiting for help after their villages were flattened by Cyclone Pam's 170mph winds last Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, citing figures from Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office, upgraded the number of confirmed deaths to 13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Among the dead were seven people from Tafea province, which includes Tanna, and six from Shefa province, which includes the main island of Efate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Given the immense power of the storm, the relatively low death toll is a testament to the residents' experience in dealing with cyclones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In many villages, people found shelter in special structures built with sturdy walls that can withstand heavy winds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Vanuatu's government authorised the distribution of emergency food and water supplies to affected areas, but was still waiting to finish its damage assessment report before beginning a wider distribution of relief items.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Some relief supplies have been starting to get there anyway, but the more organised and the larger relief efforts will start tomorrow," said Osnat Lubrani, the UN's humanitarian co-ordinator for Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The relief has to start coming now, because if it doesn't come in the next two days or so, then we will have problems with food and with water."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Aerial surveys of the islands continued, with a New Zealand air force plane flying over Vanuatu's northern islands to survey the damage and check on potential water sources for survivors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Vanuatu is a nation of subsistence farmers, and many people depend on the food they grow to survive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The cyclone wiped out gardens, killed livestock and contaminated the water supply in many areas, and agricultural experts estimate that those displaced by the storm will run out of food in less than a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Vanuatu government needs at least 1.35 million in financial aid to buy supplies and ship them to the worst-hit islands, the UN said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The government was asking for donations of enough biscuits, rice and canned protein to help keep islanders fed until June, when newly planted crops will be ready.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A barge carrying food, water and shelter materials arrived on Tanna today and the supplies were being taken to the island's main hospital, said Tom Perry, spokesman for CARE Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Two assessment teams were also planning to reach remote sections of the island on that were reported to have been devastated, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The storm turned Tanna's lush tropical forests into a jumble of broken trunks and strewn branches, and damaged or destroyed at least 80% of homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Critically, it also broke water pipes and destroyed vegetable patches, cutting off food and water sources for most of the island's 30,000 residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On the eastern side of the island near the belching volcano Yasur, people say the problems are compounded by volcanic ash that the winds spread everywhere, killing the plants.</td></tr>

<h3>5 key findings from AP's story on WHO and the Ebola outbreak</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>4, 2014 file photo, people watch as a health worker, right, sprays a man suspected of dying from Ebola with disinfectant chemicals in Monrovia, Liberia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a delay that some say may have cost lives, the World Health Organization resisted calling the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a public health emergency until the summer of 2014, two months after staff raised the possibility and long after a senior manager called for a drastic change in strategy, The Associated Press has learned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>GENEVA (AP) - In the aftermath of the world's biggest outbreak of Ebola, the World Health Organization acknowledged it was too slow to act, blaming factors including a lack of real-time information and the unprecedented nature of the epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But an investigation by The Associated Press has revealed the U.N. health agency knew from the start how unusual the outbreak was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>WHO officials privately floated the idea of declaring an international health emergency in early June, more than a month before the agency maintains it got its first sign the outbreak merited one - in late July - and two months before the declaration was finally made on August 8, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>WHO blamed its slow response partly on a lack of real-time information and the surprising characteristics of the epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In fact it had accurate field reports - including scientists asking for backup - and it identified the unprecedented features of the outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The agency was also hobbled by a shortage of funds and a lack of clear leadership over its country and regional offices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Politics appear to have clouded WHO's willingness to declare an international emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Internal emails and documents suggest the U.N. health agency was afraid of provoking conflict with the Ebola-stricken countries and wary that a declaration could interfere with the economy and the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An Ebola-infected WHO consultant in Sierra Leone violated WHO health protocols, creating a rift with Doctors Without Borders that was only resolved when WHO was thrown out of a shared hotel.</td></tr>
