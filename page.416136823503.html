<h3>Ebola: The Fight To Reach Zero And The Road To Recovery</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The crisis has resulted in over 25,551 cases and over 10,588 deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It has highlighted the immediate challenges community members and response workers face operating in fragile healthcare systems and its broader effects on local economies, food security, and cultural norms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On one hand, these challenges have been daunting; on the other hand, it has been encouraging to witness local governments, NGOs, and international actors collectively create solutions and greatly reduce the number of cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, even as rates in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone have significantly decreased, we must continue to reach our target of zero cases, prevent future outbreaks, and rebuild afflicted communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Existing relationships between NGOs and the local communities have allowed organizations to coordinate with local partners and successfully provide immediate medical assistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Management Sciences for Health and International Medical Corps worked with Liberian Ministries of Health to construct Ebola treatment centers and community care centers in the affected countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>To prevent rapid transmission, Global Communities is successfully conducting safe burials in Liberia through recognizing local traditions and norms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As the number of Ebola cases decline, vigilant contact tracing is paramount to reducing the cases to zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mapping efforts by American Red Cross International Services has been vital to identifying existing outbreaks and predicting future outbreaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The crisis has resulted in a significant decrease in trade across borders, shrinkage in each country's workforce, and shortage in food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The World Bank estimates that all three affected countries will "lose at least US $1.6 billion in forgone economic growth in 2016 as a result of the epidemic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>To mitigate the outbreak's ripple effects, The Solidarity Center is currently providing financial assistance to infected workers and for families of deceased workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Additionally, Presbyterian Disaster Assistance and Hunger Program is working with communities to improve food security by maintaining agricultural production.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>With the impeding rainy season, it is imperative that partners continue to address Ebola outbreaks in remote areas while constructing strong healthcare systems to prevent future outbreaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>While the priority is getting to zero cases, host national and local governments, NGOs, and international institutions should remain well-coordinated and respect, understand, and support the existing assets that local communities have to combat disease in varying contexts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Through collaborative, integrated efforts, we can rid the disease while building a road to sustainable recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>To learn more about the NGO response and the continued efforts, listen to my segment on Fighting Ebola, an online audio series hosted by the U.S. Department of State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Lindsay Coates is the executive vice president of InterAction -- the largest U.S. alliance of nongovernmental organizations working on global poverty issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Coates also serves on boards of the Episcopal Relief and Development as well as the World Bank Global Partnership for Social Accountability.</td></tr>
