<h3>Nationals name Max Scherzer opening day starter (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Max Scherzer will start the Washington Nationals' opener on April 6 against the New York Mets, not Stephen Strasburg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>''It's going to be real exciting,'' Scherzer said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''It's a great honor to be able to start opening day, especially for this club, and especially on this staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But at the end of the day, it's just game one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Starting a $210 million, seven-year contract, Scherzer will be making his first opening-day start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Strasburg had pitched the last three for the Nationals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Manager Matt Williams said there were ''lots of reasons'' for picking Scherzer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''He's a really good pitcher,'' Williams said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''He's confident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Strasburg could slot in for game 3 if the team stays to its spring training rotation of Scherzer, Jordan Zimmermann, Strasburg, Doug Fister and Gio Gonzalez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Williams said he spoken with Strasburg about the opening-day start, approaching him with ''honesty'' and making sure that Strasburg understood the team had confidence in him, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''I can tell you this, to a man: The guys who are actually throwing the baseball, they don't much care about it,'' Williams said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Scherzer went 18-5 with a 3.15 ERA for Detroit last season and won the AL Cy Young Award in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He did not get the opening day start last year, taken by Justin Verlander.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Scherzer said pitching the opener was secondary to making the postseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''In my experiences, the playoffs are more intense than anything I've ever seen in the regular season,'' Scherzer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''I've started Game 1 of the playoffs.</td></tr>
