<h3>US plans for anti-Islamic State training drawing skepticism</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two months later, the program faces delays and skepticism - as Turkish officials, Syrian rebels and even former American advisers openly question whether it can ever have any battlefield impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The U.S. Defense Department says it is narrowing down a list of potential fighters to be trained under the $500 million U.S. program aimed at adding a credible ground force to the air bombing campaign already underway against IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Turkish officials say they have yet to hear the United States articulate a strategy for how the trained fighters will be deployed - or protected - in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And while U.S. officials say they are keeping their strategy close to the chest so as not to give the enemy any clues, American analysts who have spoken to the planners are skeptical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"My sense is that they do not have a real strategy in the sense of something that could actually achieve an objective," said Frederic Hof, who held ambassador status as the Obama administration's former adviser on the transition in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hof, now a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council, called the program a placeholder in case the administration wants to ramp up the fight in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I think the most it does now is that it checks a political box here in the United States, in the sense of providing talking points to the effect that you are actually doing something," said Hof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said that even the plan as it is articulated - regardless of whether it is properly implemented - holds little promise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The U.S. Defense Department has said it is aiming to train 5,000 Syrians a year for three years at a base in the central Anatolian city of Kirsehir as well as at sites in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Those modest numbers raise doubts that the forces could survive in Syria long enough to weaken IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In addition to IS militants, the new recruits would likely face attacks from a Syrian government wary of a Western-backed force, as well as Islamic militants such as the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But U.S. officials have resisted Turkish calls for the force also to be prepared to fight the government, while conceding that the recruits will have to defend themselves against all sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Joshua Landis, the director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said that U.S. officials argue that the conflict in Syria need not be a choice between Islamists on the one side and the Syrian government on the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They suggest there is a third way with a moderate insurgent force - but he said such rebels have such a small constituency on the ground that they would have no chance without massive support.</td></tr>
