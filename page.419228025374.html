<h3>Burger King: One Direction, Buzzfeed spurred chicken fries</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - This June 20, 2012 file photo shows signage at a Burger King restaurant in Indianapolis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fans of Burger King's chicken fries may have the boy band One Direction and the website Buzzfeed to thank for the return of the skinny fried sticks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At an event to hype a spicy version of the chicken fries coming out this week, Burger King said it decided to resurrect the fries last year after seeing the enthusiasm they generated on social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Eric Hirschhorn, chief marketing officer for Burger King North America, said the company noticed a spike in chicken fry mentions in January 2014 that was traced to a Buzzfeed post titled "35 Foods From Your Childhood That Are Extinct Now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>One of the items on the list was chicken fries, which Burger King sold between 2005 and 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A few months later, Hirschhorn says there was an even bigger surge when a One Direction member mentioned them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The company pointed to tweet by Liam Payne that reads, "I'm so fulllllll!!! Think I just ate my body weight in chicken fries and sides owwwwww."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The tweet - which has more than 94,000 retweets - is confusing because Burger King hadn't yet brought back chicken fries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That raises the possibility that Payne just left out a comma, and meant to say he ate chicken and fries - not chicken fries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A representative for Payne said the singer wasn't available for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A Burger King representative said in an email: "Whatever he meant, it certainly helped catapult 'Chicken Fries' into pop culture consciousness as a follow up to the Buzzfeed story."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Even if Burger King misinterpreted Payne's tweet, it worked out for the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The return of chicken fries as a limited-time offer last summer was successful enough that Burger King added them to its permanent menu this March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A box comes with nine pieces and costs around $3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Hirschhorn said people tend to get them as an extra, which drives up the amount people spend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Last month, Burger King's parent company Restaurant Brands International said sales rose 7.9 percent at established stores in the U.S. and Canada for the latest quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Burger King may have brought back chicken fries even without the social media encouragement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Since being taken over by investment firm 3G Capital, the chain has leaned heavily on its past for ideas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In addition the King and Subservient Chicken characters, it has resurrected its Big King sandwich and Yumbo ham sandwich.</td></tr>
