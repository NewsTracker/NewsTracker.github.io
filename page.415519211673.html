<h3>Robert Durst Audio Was ???Chilling??? to Discover, Director Says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Robert Durst is the subject of a six-part HBO series "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Andrew Jarecki says he and his colleagues didn't realize that their most powerful moment would emerge when their subject walked into the bathroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The documentary crew spent hours interviewing Robert Durst, who had faced decades of law enforcement scrutiny involving three deaths.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>That something turned out to be Durst, apparently saying to himself, "There it is. You're caught" and "What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The off-camera audio clip served as powerful closing moment to the HBO series "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst," which completed its sixth and final episode Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One day before the episode aired, Durst, 71, was arrested by FBI agents at a New Orleans hotel, in connection with a 2000 murder - one of three he has been suspected of since the 1980s.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>"I sat there in the edit room with my partners, [Marc Smerling and Zac Stuart-Pontier], and we just sort of shook our heads and it took a while to really understand the impact of it. It was so chilling to hear it. It's disturbing to hear it. It makes you very uncomfortable to hear it," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The audio was recorded three years ago, Jarecki said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The clip came from the group's second and final interview of Durst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Jarecki said the documentary producers discussed what to do with the clip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We talked a lot about it with our legal advisors and we said, 'Look, if we go to the authorities now, we're missing the opportunity for us to actually get the real story from him, and it may take years for them to do that because the truth is, as filmmakers, we have the freedom to do things that maybe the law enforcement authorities wouldn't have," Jarecki said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"But at the same time, we didn't want to hold it back if it was going to take forever. So all we could do was get him into the chair, which took a lot of work, and then, when we had his reaction, that was when we felt the time was right for us to show that to them and that was many, many months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Jarecki said the filmmakers did not make a deal with law enforcement over the timing of the arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We don't have that kind of power, we're not in charge of the arrest timing, and we had no idea of the arrest timing," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Los Angeles Police Department said the death of Susan Berman has been under investigation since her body was found in her home on Christmas Eve in 2000.</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>HBO said in a statement, "We simply cannot say enough about the brilliant job that Andrew Jarecki and Marc Smerling did in producing The Jinx.

<tr><td>30</td><td>The New York real estate heir has made national headlines as a person of interest or suspect in three deaths since 1982.</td></tr>
