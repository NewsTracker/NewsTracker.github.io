<tr><td>5</td><td>No arrests have been made in Tuesday night's fatal shooting of Jamyla Bolden and police don't yet know if the home was targeted or the shots were random, Ferguson Sgt. Dominica Fuller said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Jamyla's 34-year-old mother was struck in the leg and treated at a hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"You have a 9-year-old child on her mother's bed doing homework and a bullet strikes her," Fuller said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Our concern is to get this person off the street."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The shooting happened a couple of blocks from the site where 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer on Aug. 9, 2014, sparking sometimes violent protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fuller, herself the mother of a 9-year-old, was among the first officers at the home after the shooting, which was reported just after 9:30 p.m. Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She said police did all they could to help the child, to no avail.</td></tr>
