<tr><td>9</td><td>Rushing to the assistance of the students wounded in the blast in Suruc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I was behind a banner so I couldn't see the attacker, but we understand it was a suicide attack. I was thrown to the ground...I jumped up and began running before I even realised I was hurt," said Edemen, a 22-year-old journalism student at Ankara University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One witness, giving his name as Mehmet, said he saw more than 20 bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It was a huge explosion, we all shook."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Turkey's NATO allies have been seeking tighter controls on a porous border with Syria that runs alongside Islamic State-held territories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But monitoring is difficult with 1.8 million Syrian refugees now on the Turkish side and smuggling rife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>An injured student in Suruc on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The US, which has an air base at Incirlik in southern Turkey, though it is not being used for its air attacks on IS forces, called the bombing a "heinous terror attack".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told a news conference in Ankara 30 people had been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It is...most probably a suicide bombing".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Hurriyet newspaper said the attacker was an 18-year old woman, but there was no confirmation.</td></tr>

<tr><td>21</td><td>Protesters blamed the government for not preventing the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Turkey has taken and will continue to take all necessary measures against the Islamic State", Mr Davutoglu said, without giving details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Measures on our border with Syria...will be increased."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Suruc attack comes weeks after Turkey deployed additional troops and equipment along parts of its border with Syria, concerned about the risk of spillover as fighting between Kurdish forces, rebel groups, Syrian government troops and Islamic State militants intensifies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Terror has no religion, no country, no race," President Tayyip Erdogan said of the bloodiest such attack in Turkey since at least 50 people were killed in the town of Reyhanli near the border in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Tear gas used by riot police dispersed demonstrators in Istanbul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The protesters blamed the Suruc blast on lax government action on Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Turkey's Kurds have been enraged by what they see as the AKP party government's failure to do more to stop Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The PKK held Ankara responsible for Monday's attack, saying it had "supported and cultivated" Islamic State against the Kurds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Police in Istanbul fired tear gas and water cannon after a demonstration by several hundred pro-Kurdish protesters on the central Taksim Square turned violent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"Murderer Islamic State, collaborator Erdogan and AKP", ran one slogan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Kobani was the site of one of the biggest battles against Islamic State last year and was secured by Syrian Kurdish fighters last month after repeated assaults.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The YPG drove the Islamist militants back from the town with the help of US air strikes after months of fighting and siege.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The blast in Suruc came after a series of attacks on the Kurdish HDP party in the run-up to a June 7 election in Turkey, including two small bombs at a political rally in the city of Diyarbakir, which the party blamed on Islamic State sympathisers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"What gives us pause about this attack is that while the others were haphazard and sloppy ... the size of this explosion suggests something more sophisticated," said Aaron Stein, an Atlantic Council fellow who specialises on Turkey and Syria.</td></tr>
