<h3>So, where?s the Apple TV (set)??</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Apple TV set is coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That rumor has been revived once more with the report that Apple is working on an online TV service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The imminent arrival of a TV set from Apple has "has taken on the mythical status of trying to spot a 'golden-horned unicorn' in the forest," wrote Brian White, an analyst with the investment bank of Cantor Fitzgerald, in a note to investors on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But he follows this up with yet another prediction of a TV set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We believe a potential streaming TV service and offerings such as HBO NOW pave the path for even bigger ambitions for Apple with a full blown TV that allows the company to completely control the user experience," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Other financial analysts chimed in with predictions on Tuesday - including Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray, who has made similar statements before about a future TV set from Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Quoted by Smarter Analyst, Munster explained that content has been one of the hurdles to Apple selling an actual television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An online TV service, he added, could lay the groundwork for an actual Apple television, potentially in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There is some precedent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In 1997, Apple released the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh, an all-in-one computer with built-in TV functionality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That Mac also came with a remote control (which could be used for TV) and buttons for the TV mode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And of course there is Apple TV, a set-top box that streams digital content to an HDTV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But if Apple is planning to bring out a standalone TV set, it is certainly taking its time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Rumors have been swirling for years but nothing has ever materialized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>So, why do the rumors persist?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Apple has a history of combining software and services with high-end hardware - dating back, most notably, to the iPod and iTunes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The iPhone and iPad have also worked hand in glove with the App Store, making both of those market-leading devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Piper Jaffray's Munster believes that an actual television is the most logical next area of focus, according to Smarter Analyst.</td></tr>
