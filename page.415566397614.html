<h3>Cavaliers shake off poor start, roll Nets 117-92 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>After his team's sixth turnover in the game's first minutes, a disgusted Blatt called timeout and gave his players some very specific instructions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>''Stop turning the ball over,'' he told them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Cavs listened and then lit up the Nets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>J.R. Smith and Timofey Mozgov scored 17 points apiece, Kyrie Irving had 10 assists and the Cavaliers shook off the sluggish, sloppy start to win their 14th straight home game, 117-92 over Brooklyn on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>LeBron James added 16 points for the Cavs, who had seven players score in double figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Just back from a four-game road trip, Cleveland trailed by 13 in the first quarter before going on a 30-8 run and didn't look back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''The first game after a road trip is always kind of tough,'' James said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Cavs are 25-6 since Jan. 15, when they were 19-20 and being questioned about whether they were NBA title contenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Well, Cleveland is an entirely different team these days with balance, inside muscle and a healthy James, who battled knee and back issues earlier this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kevin Love returned after a two-game break to rest his back and finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Cavs recorded 32 assists on 45 field goals, a testament to their unselfishness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''We moved the ball tonight,'' James said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''Mozzy was unbelievable in the paint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kyrie was great getting guys involved and J.R. was shooting the ball well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Deron Williams scored 20 to lead the Nets, who are running out of games as they claw to get into the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Brooklyn led 22-9 in the first quarter before the Cavs stopped throwing the ball away and started making shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Smith dropped four 3-pointers - each on an assist by James - and scored 14 in the second quarter, when the Cavs' bench sparked the rally and Cleveland outscored the Nets 36-21.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''LeBron went in the post,'' Nets coach Lionel Hollins said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''We tried to help a few times and he threw it out and they made 3s, and he was in the pick-and-roll and he made plays for people and they made shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He wasn't the man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It was the guys making the shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He set them up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Leading by 12 at the half, the Cavs looked underneath in the third quarter and the 7-foot-1 Mozgov took over, scoring 12 points in the period to help Cleveland extend its advantage to 23.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The large lead allowed Blatt to rest his starters, including James, who sat out the final 5:04.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Blatt intends to closely monitor his players' minutes down the stretch as the Cavs prepare for the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Blatt said the balanced scoring attack is vital for James.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''You can't expect him to have huge games that he's had fairly regularly and you can't expect that all the time,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Following his interview session, James intently watched the closing seconds of the Miami-Portland game on a TV inside Cleveland's locker room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>As the Heat set up for a final shot, James called out ''step back'' just seconds before Dwyane Wade did just that, dropping a game-winning jumper with 13.6 seconds left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Nets' next four games are against teams battling to reach the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Brooklyn plays Milwaukee, Indiana, Boston and Charlotte in the next seven days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''All these games are huge games for us,'' Williams said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Nets: Entering Wednesday, Brooklyn was the only team in the league with a better road record than home record (Chicago and Miami had identical road and home marks).</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>... Johnson has made at least one field goal in 868 consecutive games, the league's longest active streak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>San Antonio's Tim Duncan holds the record (1,310).</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Cavaliers: Blatt feels the Cavs have slipped some defensively over the past few weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>They're ranked just 25th since March 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>''We want to get back to where we were before,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>... James has not filled in an NCAA Tournament bracket and he probably won't complete one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>But if he did, prohibitive favorite Kentucky would likely be his choice to win it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>That doesn't mean the Wildcats are invincible, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>''In the tournament, you get one team to slow the game down or a team is on fire, you never know,'' said James, who had high praise for UK coach John Calipari.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Nets: Host Milwaukee on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Cavaliers: Host Indiana on Friday.</td></tr>
