<h3>Demonstrators in Belarus assail Russia's policy, express solidarity with Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The demonstrators carried a placard reading "Russia is War," a reference to Moscow's support for a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Wednesday's rally in Minsk was approved by the authorities and police didn't intervene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has forged close economic, political and military ties with Russia, which has supported the ally with cheap energy and other subsidies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 10 million with an iron hand for more than 20 years, drawing Western criticism for his relentless crackdown on dissent and independent media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But Belarus' ties with the West have improved recently as Minsk hosted Ukraine peace talks, and Lukashenko has criticized some of Moscow's moves.</td></tr>
