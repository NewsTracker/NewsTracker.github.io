<h3>Kendall Jenner attends Youth premiere at Cannes Film Festival</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>She made an impact when she first attended the Cannes Film Festival last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But Kendall Jenner certainly kicked it up a notch for her first red carpet appearance at this year's event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 19-year-old model put on an incredible display as she arrived for the screening of Youth on Wednesday evening in her eye-catching Azzedine Alaia pieces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Yes Kendall Jenner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Amongst the classic glitz and glamour of the Cannes Film Festival the supermodel brings a fresh approach to red carpet dressing and we love it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>No taffeta or fish tails for Kendall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>No overdone hair or being weighed down by jewels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This may be a grown up event but Kendall keeps things youthful and modern in a matching cropped top and skirt by cult French designer Azzedine Alaia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It's a favourite label of her big sister Kim Kardashian but this is worlds away from the signature stretch knit dresses we're used to from the brand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's a look from the SS15 ready-to-wear collection and the combination of a dramatic full maxi skirt with the midriff baring crop is a winner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Go straight to the top of our best dressed list Ms Jenner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sadly this look isn't available online but click (right) to check out the full collection on Alaia's revamped website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Kendall's shoes, however, are for sale right now at Net-a-Porter so why not treat yourself to those instead?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>As ever, she made sure one of her many enviable body parts was on show and this time, it was her pancake-flat torso that stole the limelight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She donned a very short black crop top with a mesh-style overlay and transparent edging, giving a cheeky glimpse of her braless cleavage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The item was paired with a hugely flowing, oversized skirt in the same fabric and design, hints of her endless legs showing through the swathes of net.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>As one of the fashion world's hottest up-and-coming models, Kendall really proved herself as she cut an impeccable figure on the red carpet at the Grand Theatre Lumiere at the Palais des Festivals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She upped the glamour with a chunky glitzy Chopard bangle and matching choker, finishing off the look with towering strappy black sandals, adding further height to her already lofty frame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star turned this way and that to show off her directional ensemble from all angles and, at one point, made sure the drama of her skirt was visible as she held it out and spun around in the middle of the red carpet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The raven-haired beauty wore her tresses pulled into a chic up-do, while also adding a splash of Hollywood glamour with scarlet red lipstick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She oozed confidence as she soaked up the vibe at the Cote d'Azur-based festival, which is now in its 68th year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And, shortly after turning the red carpet her own personal runway, she took to Instagram to share with her millions of social media fans that she had had a great time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Kendall was one of the many stars at the Wednesday evening premiere for Youth, which stars Jane Fonda, Rachel Weisz and Harvey Keitel among others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The movie, written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino also stars movie icon Michael Caine and is up for the coveted Palme d'Or prize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It tells the story of a pair of 80-year-old friends on holiday in the Alps, looking back at their lives and the time they have left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>One of the men is a film director struggling to complete his latest movie, while the other is a retired composer and conductor who is considering an offer to return to work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Meanwhile, Kendall has been enjoying herself in the Riviera town for the past day, after touching down at Nice Airport on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>She spent time earlier on Wednesday with her BFF Cara Delevingne, who is also in Cannes for the 11-day long film festival, which ends on Sunday May 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The girls - who have been friends for a couple of years - looked relaxed as they meandered around the area together in casual but impeccably stylish clothing, and also laying down on sunloungers for a spot of sunbathing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Also at the Youth premiere were - of course - the stars of the movie, who turned out in their finest attire for their big night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Brit beauty Rachel, 45, divided opinion in a turquoise green satin number, with full sleeves and a key-hole style slit on the front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The garment skimmed down over her slim and shapely hips before the skirt kicked out into an A-line shape from the mid-thigh, falling to the floor with a long train.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The brunette star had her locks coiffed into elegant curls, and she further added some glamour with a pair of glitzy dangling earrings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Jane, 77, showed off her status as a movie icon in her jaw-dropping black and bright pink gown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>She looked far younger than her years as she stalked the red carpet like a pro, smiling for the cameras while posing with her co-stars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Years of healthy living and a love of fitness has given the two-time Oscar winning actress a figure to die for, and something she gladly showed off in the fitted, dramatic frock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Romanian actress Madalina Ghenea, 26, also looked gorgeous in a sheer white gown with a feathered hemline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>As is often the way at the Cannes premieres, the red carpet was lined with stars, from actors to models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Also in attendance at Wednesday's screening were the likes of Karlie Kloss, Joan Smalls, Chanel Iman, Lara Stone, Petra Nemcova, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Doutzen Kroes, Izabel Goulart and newlywed actors Nikki Reed and Ian Somerhalder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>It was a double premiere night in Cannes on Wednesday: later in the evening, the stars were out once again, this time for the screening of Chinese film Shan He Gu Ran (Mountains May Depart).</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Leading the way in a glamorous, shimmering gown was French actress Sophie Marceau, who is one of the jurors on this year's Cannes panel in the main competition section.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The youthful 48-year-old dazzled in a multi-coloured backless gown that glittered in the lights at the nighttime event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>French model and actress Louise Bourgoin also put in an appearance, as did Harvey Keitel who went along for his second red carpet event of the night, this time on the arm of his wife Daphna Kastner.</td></tr>
