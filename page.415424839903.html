<h3>Calm Prevails in Ferguson After Shooting of Police Officers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Chaunte Williams, 13, holds up three candles as she takes part in a vigil, March 12, 2015, in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Two police officers were shot early Thursday morning in front of the Ferguson Police Department during a protest following the resignation of the city's police chief in the wake of damning U.S. Justice Department report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The protesters who spent eight months pressing for changes in Ferguson's police practices after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown take credit for this week's resignations of the city manager and the police chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And they insist they still have unfinished business, with many planning to stay in the streets until the mayor of the St. Louis suburb is forced out and the entire police force dissolved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We will protest until we see everything in our favor. This movement has legs," Derrick Robinson, a protest organizer, declared Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We're out here fighting for justice and equality, and that's what we'll continue to fight for."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Part of the movement has also been channeled into legislative change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Wednesday, about two dozen people from the Don't Shoot Coalition and the American Civil Liberties Union traveled to the Missouri Capitol in support of the "Fair and Impartial Policing Act," a measure that would strengthen state laws about racial profiling by police and require law officers to undergo "anti-bias" training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Justice Department fueled the sense of achievement among activists, announcing in a scathing report last week that it had found widespread racial bias in the city's policing and in a municipal court system driven by profit extracted from mostly black and low-income residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That same report also cleared former Ferguson officer Darren Wilson in the Aug. 9 death of Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old who for protesters became a symbol of unjustified use of force and unfair treatment of minorities by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Justice Department's conclusions drew a muted response among activists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Only a few dozen protesters gathered that night outside Ferguson's police station - the nexus of many demonstrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That was in sharp contrast to the throngs that turned out there and across the nation in the days after Brown's death and in November, when a Missouri grand jury declined to indict Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The comparatively sparse turnout raised questions about whether the movement had lost momentum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Organizers said the federal government's conclusions had been expected after some of the findings were leaked in the weeks before the formal announcements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Rasheen Aldridge, a 20-year-old regular at the protests, considers Ferguson his generation's civil-rights movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That idea, he said, seemed to gain resonance in the last week after the killing of an unarmed biracial man by a white officer in Madison, Wisconsin, and the suspension of a University of Oklahoma fraternity chapter that was caught on video singing a racist chant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Aldridge, head of Young Activists United St. Louis, said he did not expect the protest movement "to grow into the energy that it has, empowering young people not to be silent anymore and to take action and fix it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"This is the new time to make changes," added Aldridge, also a member of the Ferguson Commission, a group tasked by Missouri's governor to address underlying social and economic problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"This is our time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In the months after Brown's death, some demonstrations were marred by looting and arson fires that targeted businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Organizers blamed those incidents on outside agitators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That was the case again Thursday, when two police officers helping monitor protests outside the police department were shot in an attack that was still under investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The officers were later released from the hospital.</td></tr>

<h3>Will Credit Card Companies Reap The Benefits Of Growing Mobile Payment Market?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Credit card giants Visa and MasterCard have recently taken steps to capitalize on the growing mobile payment sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>These companies, which account for over 80% of the market share in terms of total credit and debit card spending, could see significant revenue boosts on this front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>According to Gartner, worldwide mobile payment transaction volume was around $235.4 billion in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was estimated to be $325 billion in 2014, and is expected to grow to $717 billion by 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The mobile payment market in the U.S. alone was around $50 billion in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The growth in mobile payments has been driven by several factors, such as the growth in smartphone users, increased acceptance of mobile payments by merchants, a shift from magnetic strips to mobile wallets, and easy access to loyalty programs and coupons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Credit card companies allow customers to use their network and infrastructure to carry out transactions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In exchange for these services, they charge a transaction-processing fee from merchants, each time a cardholder uses their card for a transaction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The total transactions processed for Visa grew by 10% year-over-year to a little over 66 billion in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>For MasterCard, the total number of transactions processed grew by 13% y-o-y to around 43 billion for 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A higher incidence of mobile payments is expected to result in more transaction fee revenues generated by the credit card industry, which currently accounts for about 30% of the total revenues for both Visa and MasterCard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>However, we could see mobile payments cannibalize existing plastic card revenues or other online methods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mobile payments will boost the earnings of credit card companies if there is an increase in the total number of consumer transactions, and/or if consumers continue to replace cash with electronic payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There are several factors that continue to pose hurdles to mobile and electronic payments growth, such as the risk of identity theft or fraud, and other security concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In order to address these concerns, Visa and MasterCard launched their "tokenization" technology that replaces sensitive account information with a series of random numbers during payment authorization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This should help increase the adoption of mobile payment technology to positively impact the credit card giants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Recently, the mobile payment market has caught the attention of major tech firms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>With the launch of Apple Pay last October, other tech firms are gearing up to tap into the nascent, but fast-growing mobile payment market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Last month, Google acquired mobile payment company Softcard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Through this deal, the mobile wallet will be pre-installed by AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless on Android phones sold in the U.S. Meanwhile, Samsung bought mobile payment company LoopPay and is set to launch Samsung Pay in summer 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In another development, seventy U.S. retailers, which include household names such as Wal-Mart, Target and CVS, formed a Merchant Customer Exchange consortium to take a piece of the mobile payment market by operating their own application called CurrentC.</td></tr>
