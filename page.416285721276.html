<h3>Hillary Rodham Clinton completes shift on same-sex marriage</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Rodham Clinton wants the Supreme Court to grant same-sex couples a constitutional right to marriage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a move sure to please activists who had been frustrated by her conditional support for same-sex marriage, Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign says she now wants the Supreme Court to back marriage equality as a constitutional right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Clinton has been a vocal backer of gay rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But she had hedged when it came to marriage, saying she advocated expansion of marriage rights for same-sex couples on a state-by-state basis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hillary Rodham Clinton kicked off her presidential run in Iowa with an implicit pledge: that she would be a different candidate and run a different campaign than in 2008, when she was viewed as imperial and distant en route to a third-place finish in the caucuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That changed this week as a Supreme Court case looms in which advocates will ask the justices to strike down the remaining state laws that ban same-sex marriages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Hillary Clinton supports marriage equality and hopes the Supreme Court will come down on the side of same-sex couples being guaranteed that constitutional right," Adrienne Elrod, a campaign spokeswoman, said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The shift was first reported by BuzzFeed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The statement puts Clinton in line with the Obama administration and many other Democrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on the issue April 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The justices will consider whether same-sex marriage bans in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee are constitutional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gay-rights advocate are hopeful the decision will establish a nationwide right to marry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The issue has long been a complicated one for Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While first lady, her husband signed the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law reviled by gay rights groups that allowed states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that took place in other states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Supreme Court struck down parts of that law in 2013, a move applauded by Clinton at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>While secretary of State, Clinton was a forceful backer of the rights of gays and transgender people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But like President Obama, Clinton did not support gay marriage when she ran for president eight years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As recently as last year, Clinton stopped short of advocating same-sex marriage as a constitutional right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Marriage had always been a matter left to the states," she said last year during a testy exchange on NPR's "Fresh Air."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I fully endorsed the efforts by activists to work state by state. In fact, that is what is working," Clinton said then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"It is now continuing to proceed state by state. I am hopeful we will make progress and see even more change and acceptance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In that interview, Clinton took issue with interviewer Terry Gross, who implied that her hedging on the issue of gay marriage was a political calculation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Just because you are a politician doesn't mean you are not a thinking human being," Clinton said then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"You gather information, you think through positions.& You are constantly reevaluating where you stand."</td></tr>
