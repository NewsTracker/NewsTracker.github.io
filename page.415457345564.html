<tr><td>3</td><td>The eye of the storm passing over Vanuatu early on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Vanuatu President Baldwin Lonsdale used a speech at a UN conference in Sendai, Japan, to appeal for international assistance on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I stand to appeal on behalf of the government and people of Vanuatu to the global community to give a lending hand in responding to these very current calamities that have struck us."</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>"The sheer force of the storm combined with communities just not set up to withstand it, could have devastating results for thousands across the region."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Aurelia Balpe, head of the Pacific regional office of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said there were unconfirmed reports of casualties in the capital Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But they had greater fears for outlying southern islands, home to more than 33,000 people.</td></tr>
