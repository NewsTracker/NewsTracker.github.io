<h3>Hillary Clinton: Just Do You</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Clinton has always been a divisive figure in American politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But love her or hate her, she's now a two-time Presidential candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Perhaps the some of her divisiveness comes from the struggle many ambitious women experience: The complex push-and-pull between who she is, who she wants to be and what society expects her to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>(I should caveat this by saying that I am not a psychologist or trained to analyze people I have never met. What follows is purely my interpretation of what I see.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton has traveled a long way to get to this point, and the path still seems unsteady.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She seems to have an "authenticity problem."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She is often perceived as aloof, perhaps hiding something and closed-off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I think maybe she comes off this way because she's navigating a strange road between being the politician she is and being a woman as society and her advisers (and possibly she, herself) expect her to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She has sometimes struggled with her image as a "woman in politics," but it's what she is, complete with all the baggage that comes with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Clinton was going to be a divisive figure from the start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Despite a successful law career, she was introduced to the world in the context of a potential First Lady.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Let's be real: In 1992, people had expectations about what a First Lady was supposed to look like and do, and it was a very feminine role filled with serving tea and wearing designer ball gowns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Decorate the White House for Christmas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Talk to the wives of diplomats, not the diplomats themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Clinton was not one to sit back and do what was expected, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Her foray into healthcare reform was highly criticized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She was trying to get into real policy work, which was not typically part of the First Lady's portfolio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She did it anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Meanwhile, a lot of the country discussed her clothes and haircut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A few years later, she shifted gears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The idea of the Hillary Clinton we know now writing It Takes a Village seems incredibly strange to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In my mind, it's indicative of her trying to fit into the expectations of First Lady while still having a voice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Shouldn't she have been writing policy or legal briefs about issues on which she had incredible expertise?</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Instead, it feels like a forced attempt to remake her image as a more motherly First Lady.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Fast-forward to 2015, and almost no one questions that she has the experience necessary to run for President.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But she's still an incredibly divisive person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>She has a contentious relationship with the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>There are constant rumors of discord in her campaigns and paranoia in her actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>She has trouble balancing "tough" and "shrill".</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>(I'm pretty sure male politicians wouldn't be referred to as "shrill."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>I find myself sympathetic to Clinton -- not because I agree with her political views -- but because I identify with the battles I imagine she's fought externally and internally as a career-minded woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>I see the pull between who I am, who I want to be and what I think society wants from women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>My career has determined where my husband and I go, and in nine years together, that's been from Texas to Oklahoma to North Carolina to New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Oh, and I'm 30 and don't have children, and I have no plans for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>I have all kinds of career plans, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>I can see the disapproval on some people's faces when they learn that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>It's easy to imagine how Hillary Clinton faced similar attitudes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>She may not have been determining where they lived, and she did have a child, but I think she had to feel the pressure to be a classic southern wife and mother in 1980s Arkansas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Instead, she was a wife and mother with a pretty successful law career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>And, certainly, there was pressure to be a more traditional First Lady when she moved into the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>I can see how she might get defensive about her choices -- I know I get that way if I think someone is questioning mine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Feminism was a few decades behind where I grew up in rural Texas, and that stuck with me, so sometimes I still think something is wrong with me for not being happy following a more "traditional" path.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>If others validate that inner struggle by raising an eyebrow at my choices, it makes me angry and frustrated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Perhaps this is part of what we've seen from Clinton over the last 20-plus years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>So, Hillary, I'm going to have a pretend conversation with you, like you once said you did with Eleanor Roosevelt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>As you embark on this campaign, please unapologetically and completely be yourself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>If that is a tough, ruthless politician, just do it instead of trying to balance external (or internal) standards of what women should do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>But, let us see you as human, too -- if you struggle, don't hide it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Everyone needs to see that it's not easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>No hiding behind email servers or campaign spokespeople when something comes out wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Trust me, the people who won't vote for you aren't changing their minds, regardless of what you do, so you might as well be who you are.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>I'm not sure what I think you'd say back to me, but I really hope it would be that your conversations with Eleanor have helped you develop a thick enough skin to be yourself on this campaign regardless of what you think Americans want or what anyone tells you.</td></tr>
