<h3>Egyptian court adjourns Al Jazeera trial after witnesses admit lapses</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The decision came after expert witnesses, who had previously said the Al Jazeera reporting had harmed national security, admitted they had not seen all the video collected as evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mohamed Fahmy, a naturalized Canadian who has given up his Egyptian citizenship, and Egyptian Baher Mohamed are charged with aiding a terrorist organization -- a reference to the Muslim Brotherhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The court heard testimony from a committee of technical experts that had said last year the Al Jazeera journalists had broadcast footage that was harmful to Egypt's security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The judge said a new committee would have to be formed when the witnesses said they had not seen all the available footage before they had signed their damning report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I did not see them and I did not write a report on them," Mohamed Abdel Hakim, president of the original committee, said when asked about some of the videos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Outside of the courtroom, the defendants expressed cautious optimism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Today I think our biggest success is that the technical committee has collapsed and they have contradicted everything they've said," Fahmy told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Fahmy and Mohamed were released on bail last month after spending more than a year in detention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A third Al Jazeera journalist, Australian Peter Greste, was deported earlier in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"An encouraging start to our #AJRetrial. Prosecution witnesses said nothing that suggests we were criminals or terrorists," Greste said on his Twitter feed as he followed the case from abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The three were originally sentenced to between seven and 10 years in prison on charges including spreading lies to help a terrorist organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Egypt's high court ordered a retrial in January.</td></tr>
