<h3>Several fatalities in Sweden shooting: police</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two men were killed and more than 10 were wounded after gunmen burst into a pub firing automatic weapons in a suspected gang-related attack in the Swedish city of Gothenburg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Customers in the bar were watching football on television when at least two gunmen, reportedly wearing skeleton masks, launched their shooting spree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We are assuming that this is gang-related and not a terrorist attack," police spokesman Bjoer Blixter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We've had similar problems with shootings for several years but never of this magnitude."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A manhunt has been launched for the gunmen who fled by car after the shooting in a heavily immigrant area of Sweden's second city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Blixter said two people died and between 10 and 15 were wounded, but the death toll could rise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gothenburg police said they have launched a murder investigation and are questioning a large number of people but no arrests have been made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Sweden and neighbouring Denmark have a longstanding problem with criminal gangs, including Hells Angels, Bandidos and several immigrant groups which battle for control of the local drug trade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The shooting fitted a pattern of regular tit-for-tat retributions between rival gangs in areas with high immigrant populations in Gothenburg, which lies on Sweden's southwestern coast and has a population of 550,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One witness told the Aftonbladet tabloid that two people entered the pub in Gothenburg's heavily immigrant suburb of Biskopsgaarden armed with weapons that looked like Kalashnikovs and started shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Another witness said the shootings were over quickly.</td></tr>

<h3>Great Barrier Reef braces for cyclone hit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cyclone Nathan was abut 300 km (185 miles) east-northeast of the holiday town of Cooktown, moving at 8 kph (5 mph) and intensifying as it approached land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It is expected to hit the coast on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Nobody's around," said David Smith, owner of the ScubaDave diving school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Everyone that came to the reef to dive is gone and won't be back until after Nathan passes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A month ago, Cyclone Marcia slammed into the southern part of the same coast, causing billions of dollars in damage and leaving thousands homeless or without electricity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Meteorologists predict Nathan will churn up winds nearing 300 kph (185 mph) from late on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The sea is likely to rise steadily up to a level well above the normal tide, with damaging waves and flooding of some low-lying but g areas, which could also extend some way inland," the Bureau of Meteorology said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Emergency officials said hundreds of residents, along with workers at a silica mine and the Lizard Island resort on the Great Barrier Reef had been evacuated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said up to 9,000 people could be directly in the path of the cyclone by the time it builds to category four strength, the second highest level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"A category four crossing is very serious," she told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"To be safe, you must stay in your homes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Queensland Fire and Emergency Services regional director Wayne Coutts said residents had limited time to prepare and people should be ready for a loss of power and water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The cyclone is small in terms of area but has entered a climatic environment in which rapid intensification can occur, meteorologists said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Emergency workers were counting on the cyclone coming ashore close to a low tide, mitigating the force of a storm surge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The cyclone is expected to lose much of its punch over land but meteorologists warned it could reform again if it reaches the warm waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria, 250 km (155 miles) from the coast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The archipelago nation of Vanuatu was devastated last week by Cyclone Pam, one of the worst storms ever to hit the South Pacific.</td></tr>
