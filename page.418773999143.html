<tr><td>4</td><td>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - In a major tactical shift, Turkish warplanes struck Islamic State group targets Friday across the border in Syria, Turkish officials announced - a move that came a day after IS militants fired at a Turkish military outpost, killing a soldier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Turkey, which spans the intersection of Europe and Asia and borders the Middle East, had long been reluctant to join the U.S.-led coalition against the extremist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a related, long-awaited development, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirmed that Turkey had agreed to let the U.S. use a key base in southern Turkey for military operations against the militants "within a certain framework."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He did not elaborate on the agreement, which a U.S. official said was reached during a phone call this week with President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the airstrikes Friday had "removed potential threats" to Turkey, hitting their targets with "100 percent accuracy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He did not rule out further airstrikes, saying Turkey was determined to stave off all terror threats against it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The private Dogan news agency said as many as 35 IS militants were killed in one of the three targets hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The agency did not cite a source for the report and there was no official confirmation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A human rights group in Syria said some IS militants were killed, but not that high number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This was not a point operation, this is a process," Davutoglu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It is not limited to one day or to one region ... the slightest movement threatening Turkey will be retaliated against in the strongest way possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>For their part, Turkish police launched a major operation Friday against terror groups including Islamic State, carrying out simultaneous raids in Istanbul and 12 provinces and detaining more than 290 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A government official said three F-16 jets took off from Diyarbakir air base in southeast Turkey early Friday and used smart bombs to hit three IS targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of government rules requiring authorization for comment, said the targets were two command centers and a gathering point for IS supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Davutoglu said Turkish planes did not violate Syrian airspace on Friday, but he did not rule out incursions in the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He denied news reports claiming that Turkey had told the Syrian regime about the airstrikes, but said it had contacted NATO allies before the operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the three Turkish airstrikes were all near the border, ranging from 200 meters (yards) to four kilometers (2.4 miles) inside Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said the airstrikes targeted vehicles for the extremists as well as an IS gathering point, with one strike hitting just north of the Syrian border village of Hawar al-Nahr.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Abdurrahman said several IS fighters were killed in the airstrikes but much less than the 35 reported by Turkish media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"(IS) is imposing a blackout on its losses, although there aren't large losses," Abdurrahman told The Associated Press by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The agreement on Incirlik follows months of U.S. appeals to Turkey and delicate negotiations over the U.S.-led coalition using Incirlik or other bases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>When asked about the accord Friday, Davutoglu said an agreement that takes Turkey's concerns into account had been reached, but did not elaborate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Citing operational security, the White House declined to confirm the agreement, but noted that Obama and Erdogan had agreed to "deepen our cooperation" against IS in their call Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Turkey's moves came as the country finds itself drawn further into the conflict in neighboring Syria by a series of deadly attacks and signs of increased IS activity inside Turkey itself.</td></tr>
