<h3>Iraqi troops pause battle for Tikrit, await reinforcements</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BAGHDAD, Iraq - Iraqi forces and mainly Shia militiamen battling to wrest full control of the city of Tikrit from Islamic State militants paused their offensive for a second day on Saturday as they awaited reinforcements, a military source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>More than 20,000 troops and Iranian-backed Shia fighters entered Tikrit on Wednesday, having retaken areas to the north and south in a campaign launched almost two weeks ago, Iraq's biggest offensive against the militants yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Islamic State fighters still hold about half the city and have booby-trapped buildings and laid improvised explosive devices and roadside bombs, the source in the local military command center told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>More "well-trained forces" were needed for the street-by-street battles that recapturing the whole city would require, the source said, speaking by phone from Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He did not give a timeline for their arrival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Victory for Iraq's Shia-led government in Tikrit against the Sunni insurgents would set the tone for a broader confrontation in Mosul, the largest city in the north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We do not need a large number, just one or two thousand. We need professional personnel and soldiers," the source told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Military commanders had "reached a decision to halt the operation until a suitable, carefully set plan is in place" to break into central Tikrit, the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Islamic State overran Iraq's weakened army last year, seizing large amounts of territory where they have declared a caliphate and imposed brutal rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In Tikrit, which lies about 160 km (100 miles) north of Baghdad, the extremist group still controls central districts and a complex of palaces built by Saddam Hussein, the executed former Iraqi leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Iraqi security expert Hisham al-Hashemi doubted the city could be retaken with ground forces only, saying airpower was required to clear the many buildings which the IS fighters had rigged with explosives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As the army and Shia militias, who are known as Hashid Shaabi (Popular Mobilization), recaptured IS-held towns near Tikrit, a small number of residents who had fled the militants' advance began to return home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nearly 2 million Iraqis were displaced last year and officials have said that securing their return is a priority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Friday, some 200 families went home to the town of al-Alam with a security personnel escort from the government-held town of Dhuluiya, police sources there said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>While the offensive on Tikrit has been put on hold, clashes in the environs continue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In the town to the north of al-Malha, near the Beiji oil refinery, IS fighters were fighting police and Hashid Shaabi forces, local police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Iraqi forces were advancing toward the strategically important al-Fatha bridge, which was blown up by the militants this week, Interior Ministry spokesman Brig.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Gen. Saad Maan told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Kurdish peshmerga forces, backed by Shia militia fighters, have been attacking Islamic State-held towns and villages south and west of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, peshmerga sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Their advances, unlike the Tikrit battle to the southwest, have been backed by sustained air strikes from a US-led coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Islamic State also carried out attacks in Ramadi, about 90 km west of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Two suicide car bombers attacked security personnel positions, killing two policemen, a police source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The attacks were followed by clashes between IS fighters and Iraqi security forces in the city center, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>And on the outskirts of Samarra, a sacred Shia city being used as a rear base for the Tikrit offensive further north, militants attacked an Iraqi army unit on Friday, two security officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>One said 11 soldiers had been captured by the militants while the second said some soldiers had gone missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A bomb near a busy market killed 4 people and wounded 11 in the Sab al-Bour neighborhood of northern Baghdad, police and medics said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.</td></tr>
