<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece meets latest IMF loan payment of 459m - leading baffled economists to ask: where did it get the money from?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece met a loan payment of 459 million to the International Monetary Fund on Thursday, according to reports, as the EU discusses whether the country has reformed enough to merit a further cash injection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The payment order has been given," a finance ministry source told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But no one is quite sure where the money came from - a consequence of the opaque Greek finance system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There are few trained accountants in the country and they do not adhere to international accounting standards, so records are thin and many citizens do not pay tax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Poor accounting standards are blamed by some for the uncertain numbers that have come out of Greece regarding the country's debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Athens is aware of the tax problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It promised to hire tourists and cleaners as part time tax inspectors in a recent round of reforms drawn up to meet EU criteria for further cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The latest IMF payment was ordered at the same time as Greek Prime Minister Alex Tsipras met Putin in Moscow to discuss co-operation between the two orthodox Catholic nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While both parties denied that Greece had financial aid had been requested, the two sides are said to have talked about extending a Turkish natural gas pipeline through Greece and relief from Russian sanctions on European food produce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Russian investment in key Greek infrastructure, including the port of Thessaloniki, is also in discussion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said during a visit to Washington this week that Greece would meet the April 9 payment and every other until the debts are cleared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He still has some way to go - next month, Athens owes a further 950 million to the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Over 2 billion euros in six- and three-month treasury bills are also due to mature on April 14 and 17 - though they should roll on to the next maturity without incurring further cost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>This week Athens raised another 1.14 billion in six-month Treasury bills and announced a further sale of 625 million next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The country is dependent on such short terms bonds to raise cash, but the takers are mostly domestic investors because Greece is shut out of international debt markets.</td></tr>
