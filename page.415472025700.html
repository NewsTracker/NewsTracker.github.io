<h3>Cyclone Pam: 'It was like a velociraptor', as Australians survive Vanuatu cyclone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>They face long queues, piles of debris and patchy phone reception - but two Australian television producers are thankful they survived Tropical Cyclone Pam in one piece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Former Channel 10 morning television director Adam Boland and his partner Kenny Ang were evacuated from their home on Wednesday and took shelter with Boland's mother on the country's main island, Efate, as the worst of the storm hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>So far, eight people are confirmed dead, twenty have serious injuries, and an estimated 10,000 people are homeless in the wake of the category five storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Though gale-force winds battered the home where Mr Ang sheltered in Havannah, uprooting trees and ripping away the gutter, he says he got off lightly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Once the storm had passed, he had one message for his friends on social media: "Alive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It will be a long time until this place is back to normal," Mr Ang posted on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While the worst of the storm lasted for just twelve hours, the cyclone has left a lasting mark on the people and infrastructure of Vanuatu, Mr Ang told Fairfax Media while he queued for petrol on the Kumul Highway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It was quite scary," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Where we were, we didn't even get the worst of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It sounded like a velociraptor shrieking and all we sort of saw was black, things [were] just banging. There's devastation everywhere... we got hit hard, but drive into town and everyone's been hit so much harder," Mr Ang said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As day broke, the pair realised the extent of the damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>To get fuel for cars and generators, they had to swim across a river and get a lift from a friend to join an hours-long queue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Because there's only one ring road around the island of Efate, that was - and is - the only way to get you out of the north of the Island into town, into Port Vila. During the cyclone, that was ripped up and washed away. So we had to swim across that this afternoon to get to my friend's car," Ang said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On the way into Port Vila, they saw villages "decimated" and their occupants sitting in the debris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"A great deal of them have just been demolished," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"You see people on the side of the road just sitting, they don't know what to do now. There is no support. I know the aid agencies are here, but I haven't seen many of them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Australia has pledged $5 million of aid and humanitarian support to the island nation, including fresh water which was flown in by defence force planes on Sunday from Brisbane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Those distributing government and non-government aid have their work cut out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"In town at the moment, the picture I can paint for you is there are roofs and parts of roofs off buildings," Mr Ang said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"A lot of timber, a lot of wood, a lot of trees, power lines are down, everything along the shoreline of Vila Harbour has basically been washed up and demolished."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Ang and Mr Boland have tried to get back to their home on the island of Iririki to survey the damage, but access is severely limited after jetties on either side of the island were washed away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It's pretty bad," Mr Ang said, shortly before he had to leave for an area with little to no phone reception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"There are about 20 boats that have been washed up onto the shore of Iririki Island."</td></tr>
