<h3>Chad: Boko Haram massacres civilians in Nigeria town</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria -- Hundreds of civilians were killed as troops from Chad seized a strategically located Nigerian town from Boko Haram extremists, according to military reports and witnesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Boko Haram left hundreds of people dead Monday before fleeing Chadian forces which regained control of Dikwa, a town occupied by the militants for weeks, said Chad's military spokesman Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Azem Bermandoua.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One soldier was killed and 34 were wounded, most by a suicide car bomber, Bermandoua said on national television.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>Boko Haram invaded the town between herds of cattle and a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden car, the corporal said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the military had been warned and were well prepared to drive back the insurgents, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Konduga has been attacked many times in recent months because it is a final defense for Maiduguri, the biggest northeastern city 25 mile away that is the birthplace of Boko Haram.</td></tr>
