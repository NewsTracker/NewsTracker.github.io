<h3>Robert Durst mixed up in story as Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Associated Press accidentally mixed up troubled millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst, 71, and 44-year-old Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The misidentification came rollin' in around 6:30 p.m. local California time Monday in the second paragraph of a story about drug charges filed against Robert Durst in New Orleans, according to the media blog Romenesko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The first line referenced Robert Durst by name, but the second referred to him as "the former Limp Bizkit frontman."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The AP later limped out a correction and told the blog in a statement that the mix-up was in "a brief that appeared solely on the California broadcast wire last night."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Robert Durst is awaiting extradition to Los Angeles to face a murder charge stemming from the 2000 killing of a close female friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His arrest Saturday in the Big Easy came a day before the finale of a shocking, six-part HBO documentary called "The Jinx" in which the oddball suspect appeared to confess he "killed them all, of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He did not kill Susan Berman, and he doesn't know who did," Durst's high-powered lawyer Dick DeGuerin told the Daily News on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Limp Bizkit, an alt-metal band that rose to fame in the mid-1990s with hits like "Nookie" and "Break Stuff," is currently on tour in California.</td></tr>

<h3>Syria monitor says army kills six in gas attack, military denies it</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Syrian military source described the report of an attack in the village of Sarmin in Idlib province as propaganda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We confirm that we would not use this type of weapon, and we don't need to use it," the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>President Bashar al-Assad's government has previously denied accusations that it has used chemical weapons against rebel-held areas in the four-year-old war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Officials were not available for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An army statement said dozens of militants were killed in other areas of Idlib province overnight in clashes and attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks the conflict through a network of sources, said the six dead included a man, his wife and their three children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It cited medical sources as saying they died as a result of gas from barrel bombs dropped late on Monday and that the chemical used was likely chlorine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dozens more were wounded in the attack, the Observatory said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Reuters could not independently verify the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Idlib branch of the Syrian Civil Defence rescue organization, which operates in insurgent-held areas, posted seven videos on YouTube, some at nighttime and some in a medical center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One video showed three children and a woman, all apparently unconscious, in a medical center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A voice off camera said the name of the village, Sarmin, and Monday's date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"One of the infants, only a few months old," a male voice says, shaking, as he films a baby on a gurney with liquid around its mouth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Two more infants with limp bodies are brought in, one by a man wearing a gas mask and another carrying a young girl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"She's still alive doctor," a man checking the girl says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Doctor, doctor, she is still breathing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Syrian Civil Defence includes more than 2,000 humanitarian volunteers, known as the "White Helmets" for the hard hats they wear, who work as first responders in a country where the medical infrastructure has broken down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Another video posted by the group and shot at night showed a very young girl, naked except for underwear and pink shoes, being doused in liquid by people wearing white helmets, her horrified expression illuminated by their headlamps shining on her face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Syrian Civil Defence said on Twitter there had been more than 100 casualties, including its own volunteers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kurds in neighboring Iraq have said that Islamic State insurgents used chlorine gas against military police and peshmerga forces in December and January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>An officer said the gas was used three times, and that a number of military police were treated in hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The United States is aware of the reports and is seeking additional information, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"If these allegations are confirmed, this would tragically be only the latest example of the Assad regime's atrocities against the Syrian people," Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A U.N. inquiry found in late 2013 that sarin gas had likely been used in several rebel-held districts of the Syrian capital Damascus in August 2013, where hundreds of people were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The inquiry was only looking at whether chemical weapons were used, not who used them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The government and the opposition have each accused the other of using chemical weapons during the civil war which has killed 200,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Both sides deny it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Assad agreed with the United States and Russia to dispose of his chemical weapons after hundreds of people were killed by sarin gas on the outskirts of the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons also said it had "compelling evidence" that chlorine gas was used in rebel-held villages in northern Syria last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>It did not say who carried out the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Officials in Washington regularly accuse Assad of gassing his own people and say he has lost all legitimacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday that Assad should be included in negotiations to reach a political transition, although a spokeswoman later explained that Kerry was not specifically referring to Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The Syrian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that France and Britain were "still engaging in policies that embroil the European Union in the ongoing aggression against Syria."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The statement, released after a cabinet meeting, appears to be an attempt to drive a wedge between Assad's biggest enemies in Europe, Britain and France, and other European Union states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The Syrian government has said it is willing to reengage with countries who stop supporting insurgents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Opposition activists have reported many chlorine attacks over the past year, which they said occurred when explosive canisters were dropped from army helicopters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Khaled Khoja, president of the opposition National Coalition, blamed Assad on Tuesday for the most recent reported attack: "The psychopathic dictator continues to kill by chemicals and challenges the international laws."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, an expert on biological and chemical weapons, said there had been several chlorine bomb attacks in recent days in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"On the face of it, the video of the attack looks genuine. While chlorine itself it not that deadly, it is being very effectively used as a weapon of terror, first in Syria and now in Iraq. It killed three children, who are too little to run away after an attack."</td></tr>
