<h3>CANNES WATCH: A first time for Colin Farrell at Cannes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Actor Colin Farrell attends a press conference for the film The Lobster, at the 68th international film festival, Cannes, southern France, Friday, May 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - Colin Farrell is no longer a Cannes Film Festival virgin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The actor is here for the first time with "The Lobster," a decidedly unusual film about single people who have less than two months to find a mate or face being turned into an animal and released into the woods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Despite being in dozens of films over the past two decades, Farrell told a press conference on Friday that he had never come before - and he didn't exactly make the most of his inaugural visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Farrell shot the movie, in which he stars with Rachel Weisz, in his native Ireland - a bonus for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Everything about this experience was really, really particular for me," said the actor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The writing, the cast and the experience in the location we were shooting in."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The Lobster" is competing for the Palme D'or at the festival, which closes May 24.</td></tr>
