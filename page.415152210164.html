<h3>Key Witness Didn't See Nemtsov's Killer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A man visits the site of Boris Nemtsov's death in Moscow on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MOSCOW-A woman who was walking with opposition activist Boris Nemtsov when he was gunned down near the Kremlin last weekend said Monday that she didn't see the killer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr. Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister who later became a fierce critic of the Kremlin, was crossing a bridge with Anna Duritskaya, a 23-year-old Ukrainian model, when investigators say he was shot four times in the back from a passing car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In their last update on Sunday, investigators said they were questioning witnesses and were checking recordings from security cameras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They said the killing was planned and that the perpetrators knew the route that Mr. Nemtsov would take.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Investigators have said they are probing several theories as to the motive, but state television has focused on suggestions that it could have been part of a plan by the opposition and the West to destabilize the government of President Vladimir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Kremlin has called the killing a provocation, a word that in Russian implies it was done to discredit authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr. Nemtsov's funeral is scheduled for Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Kremlin spokesman said a government representative would attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Speaking to the online news-channel Dozhd and Ekho Moskvy radio, Ms. Duritskaya said she had dined on Friday evening with Mr. Nemtsov, an acquaintance of three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They were then crossing the Bolshoi Moskvoretsky Bridge in the direction of his apartment when he was killed shortly before midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She told the media outlets that Mr. Nemtsov's assailant had approached them from behind and that a light-colored vehicle drove away from the scene of the shooting, but that she didn't see his assailant nor remember the make or license plate of the car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Anna Duritskaya poses for a photo for a modeling portfolio in Kiev, Ukraine, on Aug. 28, 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She is a key witness to the killing of Boris Nemtsov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ms. Duritskaya said she ran up to the driver of a passing snowplow and asked for the telephone number for emergency services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Police arrived 10 minutes after she dialed, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ms. Duritskaya said she was staying at a friend's apartment in Moscow but was under round-the-clock guard and that investigators weren't allowing her to leave Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She said she had given all the evidence she could, and wanted to return home to Ukraine to her mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Speaking in Geneva, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov pledged an exhaustive investigation and criticized what he called "politicized, unsubstantiated and provocative interpretations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she urged Mr. Putin to ensure the killing is solved and the culprits apprehended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We have been witnessing for some time, and we are witnessing with concern, a climate where the Russian civil society gets intimidated. This climate, this atmosphere, is of course reinforced by this murder. We can only call on Russia to meet its obligations such as those laid out in the European Convention on Human Rights," said the spokesman, Steffen Seibert, in Berlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>-Andrea Thomas in Berlin contributed to this article.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Why because she was probably complicit?</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>When Nemtsov was so afraid to be killed, why he didn't have any bodyguards?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Seems to be a rigged story, where he didn't really believe, he would be killed, but said so for political reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But others thought, that exactly for that he would be the right victim, again, for political reason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Just dating a 23 year-old Ukrainian was justification enough for nationalist Russophiles to assassinate Nemtsov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Ms. Duritskaya is a Russian spy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>She's been feeding Putin and his KGB thugs everything they wanted to know about Mr. Nemtsov and his activities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>On the night of the murder, she's what's known as the set-up woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The KGB are "holding" her now and debriefing her on what to say....she will be released soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Ohhhhh...and that snowplow that conviently came by to block the security camera just at the moment Mr. Nemtsov was shot...that was no coincidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>I think I already know the results of the investigation by the Russian government: suicide!</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Vald's and OJ's Detective agency-WERE LOOKING FOR THE REAL KILLERS!!!!</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Well, well, well, that girl is not only pretty, she's smart to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>To bad, she is probably a dead woman walking anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Well, well, well, that girl is not only pretty, she's got a brain.Or as Sgt. Schultz would say, "I see nothing, I hear nothing, and I darn sure don't say anything."</td></tr>

<tr><td>39</td><td>>>>>Mr. Nemtsov's funeral is scheduled for Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>A Kremlin spokesman said a government representative would attend.<<<<</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Putin seems like an evil character out of a bad, bad James Bond movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>@walter hauschildt @William Wilkinson He's a joke albeit a bad one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>I'll bet she didn't see anything...</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Look at the facts, it was a professional hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Six quick shots, four of them hit the target but not his companion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Time and opportunity with no witnesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The sad thing is that Merkel is "urging" the guy responsible for the murders to "ensure" that it will be solved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>@walter hauschildt So "rabble rousers", ie, opposition leaders should be killed?</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>You sound like a real Russian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>@Andrei Chivvis Putin and the Russian mafia are the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>It is well-known that Nemtsov had a very advanced form of pancreatic cancer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>He hired these hit men to kill him so that his cause dethroning Putin will be advanced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>" Investigators have said they are probing several theories as to the motive,".</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>If she admitted she saw the shooter- might she be next?</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>He was 56, she is 23 and an "acquaintance" since she was 20.He had a Phd in physics and math, she is a young Ukrainian model apparently with poor eyesight and a short attention span and they happened to be crossing a deserted bridge near midnight.She did not see the shooter and can't remember anything about the getaway car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>A curious chain of circumstances no matter how you look at it and there's a movie script here in the making.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Count on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>A major Russian opposition politician walking home with 23 yrs model around midnight - does not sound like he was a credible guy at least according to western standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>@Gershon Meltsin Russians considered him a degenerate, primary reason he was never able to get much traction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Russians on the whole are still fairly moral and have their limits what they will look past (regardless how hypocritical that may seem at times).</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Putin at least leaves his women before moving onto the next limbered gymnast and doesn't have a child hear, there, and everywhere.</td></tr>
