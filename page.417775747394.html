<h3>Buxton scores winning run in MLB debut as Twins beat Rangers (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Byron Buxton went 0 for 4 in his major league debut, but scored the winning run in the ninth inning to lift the Minnesota Twins to a 4-3 victory over the Texas Rangers on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Buxton reached on a fielder's choice and scored from first base one out later on Eddie Rosario's double to center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Casey Fien (2-2) pitched two scoreless innings and Glen Perkins pitched a perfect ninth for his American League-leading 22nd save as the Twins snapped a five-game losing streak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Eduardo Escobar opened the ninth with a double to left field, and the 21-year-old Buxton - selected No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>2 in the 2012 draft - bunted back to Shawn Tolleson (1-1), who threw out Escobar at third base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Joey Gallo and Leonys Martin homered for Texas in the second inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Twins' Brian Dozier opened the game with a home run, his 10th career leadoff shot and third this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Twins matched a club record by hitting four triples, previously done in 1964.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Three of them came in the sixth inning, yet they scored only one run in the inning - in part because Shane Robinson was picked off third base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>According to information provided to the Rangers by the Elias Sports Bureau, that's the only time in the past 50 years that a team hit three triples in an inning and scored fewer than two runs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Texas' fifth inning ended when Delino DeShields wandered off second base following a routine ground out to second base, and was tagged out when first baseman Joe Mauer fired to shortstop Escobar for the final out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>DeShields left the game in the top of the sixth, hurting his left hamstring while pursuing Robinson's after running into the wall in left center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Dozier also doubled to increase his league leading total of extra-base hits to 36.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dozier has 14 in his last 19 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Minnesota starter Phil Hughes gave up three runs in six innings, allowing multiple home runs for the fifth time in 13 starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Rangers starter Nick Martinez pitched the team's 10th consecutive quality start, matching the club record set in September 1978.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Twins outfielder Torii Hunter missed his second consecutive game while serving a two-game suspension for his altercation with umpire Mark Ripperger last Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Twins: Buxton was added to the roster after OF Aaron Hicks (right forearm strain) was placed on the disabled list Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Rangers: 3B Adrian Beltre (left thumb sprain) is eligible to come off the disabled list Tuesday, but said he still can't grip a bat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Twins: RHP Trevor May (4-4) gave up only one run in six innings in his last outing, June 9 against Kansas City, but took the loss in a 2-0 defeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Rangers: RHP Yovani Gallardo (5-6), whose previous eight seasons were in the National League, has five consecutive quality starts against the Los Angeles Dodgers.</td></tr>
