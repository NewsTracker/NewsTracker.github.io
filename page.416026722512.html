<h3>Watch: John Oliver discusses NSA, penis pics with Edward Snowden on 'Last Week Tonight'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Oliver opened his main segment on government surveillance by acknowledging that "most people would rather have a conversation about literally any other topic," but noted the importance of the discussion given the impending re-authorization or curtailment of the Patriot Act, scheduled to take place on June 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The host then noted just how many Americans seem unconcerned by the issue of government surveillance -- illustrating that point by interviewing random tourists in Times Square to see if they knew who Snowden is and what he did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(Spoiler alert: Most didn't.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Then Oliver revealed his coup to a delighted audience -- a secretive one-on-one interview with Snowden in Russia, which seemed as if it might not come to pass after Snowden was late to their meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Thankfully, Snowden finally arrived and the duo shared a frank, funny and wide-ranging discussion about everything from NSA programs to the leak of phallic photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>You can watch Oliver's entire segment on surveillance below -- the interview itself begins around the 16 minute mark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver" airs Sundays at 11 p.m. on HBO.</td></tr>
