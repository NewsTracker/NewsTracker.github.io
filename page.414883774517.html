<h3>US Reveals Mosul Assault Timing In Rare Move</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The planned spring assault on the city, with a population of over a million, will involve about 12 brigades, five of whom will soon have coalition training, the official at US Central Command added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>No decision has been made on whether small numbers of US military advisers might need to be on the ground close to Mosul to direct close air support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The main attack force would include five Iraqi army brigades, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Three smaller brigades would act as a reserve force, and three brigades of Kurdish Peshmerga troops would contain the city from the north and isolate it from Islamic State forces further west.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A so-called Mosul fighting force consisting mainly of former Mosul police officers and tribal fighters also is being assembled for the assault, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A brigade of counter-terrorism troops would also be employed in the fight, he said, adding if Iraqi forces were not ready by April or May the operation could be delayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Details of the planned assault were revealed as it emerged a serving British soldier had left his base to join Kurdish forces fighting against IS in northern Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is very unusual for the US military to openly discuss the timing of an upcoming offensive, especially to a large group of reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It is highly unusual for US military planners to reveal the timing of planned offensives and troop numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"US Centcom justified the move as a sign of renewed Iraqi military confidence. But many will remain unconvinced, given the Iraqi military's total collapse before IS forces despite years and millions of dollars worth of training by the US."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Sunni extremists have taken over large parts of Iraq and Syria and have declared an Islamic caliphate spanning both countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Over the last few months, the US-led coalition has carried out hundreds of airstrikes targeting militant positions in northern Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There are also American and British military personnel on the ground training Iraqi and Kurdish forces.</td></tr>

<h3>Sediment deposits reveal how bursts of rainfall may have driven evolution</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This is according to researchers studying cone-shaped deposits of sediment in southeast Arabia that provide a 160,000 year record of the area's climate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The deposits reveal that our early human ancestors left Africa on a journey to southern Asia around 75,000 to 130,000 years ago, during multiple phases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Human evolution may have been driven by short, rapid waves of climate change.This is according to researchers studying cone-shaped deposits of sediment from southeast Arabia that provide a 160,000 year record of the area's climate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Inset is photo ofthe exposed quarry site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The find contradicts another theory that claims human populations expanded rapidly from Africa to southern Asia via the coastlines of Arabia around 50,000 to 60,000 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The sediments reveal a period of increased rainfall, which scientists at Oxford University argue would have provided sufficient freshwater to support expanding populations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'The dispersal of early human populations out of Africa is dynamically linked with the changing climate and environmental conditions of Arabia,' said Professor Ash Parton at Oxford University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'Although now arid, at times the vast Arabian deserts were transformed into landscapes littered with freshwater lakes and active river systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The sediments - also known as alluvial fans - were found along the Western Haja in Al Sibetah, Oman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A previous study by University College London argued that the waxing and waning of huge lakes in the East African Rift valley was linked to the brain expansion of early human species.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Professor Mark Maslin, co-author of the study, said at the time: 'It seems modern humans were born from climate change.</td></tr>
