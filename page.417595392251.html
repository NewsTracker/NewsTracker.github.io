<h3>Egypt's president issues rare apology after lawyer beaten</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) " Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi issued a rare apology Sunday over a police officer beating a lawyer with a shoe last week, an attack that sparked a general one-day strike by the country's lawyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Lawyer's Syndicate issued the call for the Saturday strike to protest a deputy police chief who attacked a lawyer in the country's Nile Delta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In statement Sunday, el-Sissi called on people to respect the rights and freedoms of Egyptians, in an apparent appeal to the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I apologize to the Egyptian lawyers and to all Egyptian citizens who have been the subject of any abuse," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But in Egypt, police and powerful security agencies act with near impunity against opponents or those trying to engage in unwelcome political activity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Rights activists report a return of torture, abuses and arbitrary arrests surpassing even the 29-year rule of autocrat Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled in Egypt's 2011 revolt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The lawyers' strike was a top headline in many Egyptian newspapers Sunday, with many Egyptian media outlets reporting 90-percent participation by lawyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Sunday, a misdemeanor court in the Nile Delta province of Damietta sentenced the deputy police chief, Ahmed Abdul Hadi, to three months in prison and set his bail at some $390 on charges he beat the lawyer with a shoe, a serious insult in the Arab world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the court also sentenced the beaten lawyer, Emad Sami, to one month in prison and set bail at $130 on a charge of verbally insulting the same officer.</td></tr>
