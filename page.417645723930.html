<h3>Blackhawks draw on history, experience in Stanley Cup Final (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Blackhawks have dropped consecutive one-goal games to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Stanley Cup Final, and they had the lead in each one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And there is no panic for Jonathan Toews and company, no outward displays of frustration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Blackhawks are trying for their third NHL title in the past six seasons, and they have a history of rebounding from playoff disappointment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They dropped two of the first three games in the 2013 final against Boston and came back to win the series 4-2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They trailed 3-2 in this year's Western Conference finals against Anaheim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the Lightning are one confident bunch after Monday night's 3-2 win gave them a 2-1 lead in the series.</td></tr>
