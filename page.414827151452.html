<h3>New York Fashion Week: Naomi Campbell wows Zac Posen crowd</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>What does a runway queen wear?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A ruby glitter ballgown, of course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Naomi Campbell had Zac Posen's crowd collectively uttering that fashion word of all words - wow - when she closed his Monday night show in the flocked taffeta bustier number against the grandeur of Vanderbilt Hall in Grand Central Terminal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Compared to a sea of muted grays, blues and blacks on other runways - and the gloom of winter's deep freeze - Posen's show of color was a welcome sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It included a range of reds, emerald green, plum, burnt orange and sparkly disco silver in a column gown done up in bugle beads that glistened under the hall's stately chandeliers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And Campbell wasn't the only royalty in the house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rihanna selfied with Lee Daniels and sat front row with Mary J. Blige, while Christina Hendricks and Coco Rocha beamed from their prime seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Uzo Aduba and Katie Holmes were also among Posen's guests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Of the runway, Posen said in a backstage interview he was looking to mix and match his muses for fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He worked in stretch jersey, included more day looks and ran with a '70s vibe in sparkle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And there was mink, in scarves tied close to the neck, a coat and a bright orange top paired with a long loose skirt of a similar shade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We wanted more fluidity on the runway. I was feeling the glamour of Grace Kelly meets the spice of Chaka Khan. I draped most of the collection myself, on weekends. In my quiet moments," the affable designer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>So what's on Posen's mind for the Oscars?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's not all about the red carpet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I don't believe in pushing hard for red carpets. Getting something on a red carpet shouldn't have to be a notch every awards show," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>What else might be up for Posen?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There's a documentary in the works about his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And the avid home chef who delights followers on Instagram with his recipes and hashtag of CookingwithZac may just do a cookbook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He likes thinking up new recipes in the same way he likes taking fabric to a mannequin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Finding your ingredients is like finding a great fabric," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Both are sensual in the same way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Let no one underestimate the power of a cold beer and some spicy nuts to raise the spirits of a weary Fashion Week crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Often an 8 p.m. show feels like one too many on a freezing day, but the mood inside Rag & Bone's Fall/Winter show Monday night felt truly jovial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Did we mention they were offering beer?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>As for the clothes, designers David Neville and Marcus Wainwright channeled a '90s vibe with lots of layering, including interesting combos like a slip dress over skintight trousers with a huge parka on top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Colors were bright - especially a nice "spicy orange" - and there was a refreshing "anything goes with anything" vibe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Especially noticeable were satiny slips (silk charmeuse, actually) in all sorts of styles - slip dresses, slip skirts, even a slip jumpsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>These came in luscious colors like licorice and chocolate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The designers, whose guests included actor Dylan McDermott, dancer Lil Buck and of course Vogue editor Anna Winter, also used innovative projections on the room's massive walls, covering up windows on one side and showing constantly alternating angles of the show in progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>There were close-up runway shots, long-distance shots, and most enticingly, inside-the-wings peeks at models getting primped just before being ushered onto the catwalk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Shoes came in fun colors like bright yellow and orange, and included Mary Janes and comfy loafers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Parkas were huge and inviting, especially given the weather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>All in all a very user-friendly show - and, did we mention the beer?</td></tr>

<h3>Man arrested for making bomb threat at Islamic centre in Texas</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>No bombs were discovered at the locations in different parts of the city and police are considering whether to bring terrorism charges against the man, who was not immediately identified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Austin threat came about a week after a gunman shot dead three young Muslims near the University of North Carolina, riling Muslim activists who have demanded that U.S. state and federal authorities investigate the detained suspect for possible hate crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On Monday in Houston, a homeless man was arrested and charged with setting a fire that destroyed a building at an Islamic institute in the city last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>No one was harmed in the incident.</td></tr>
