<h3>Tennessee man charged with fraud for fake Newtown charity</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(Reuters) - A Tennessee man who U.S. prosecutors contend set up a fraudulent charity tied to the 2012 massacre at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school will face wire-fraud charges, federal officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Robert Bruce, a 34-year-old personal trainer from Nashville, will be indicted in U.S. District Court in Hartford, Connecticut, on six counts of wire fraud on Monday for what prosecutors contend was a scheme in which he collected an unspecified amount of donations intended for victims' families and school safety that he spent on himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Adam Lanza, 20, killed 26 children and educators in the December 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown before turning a gun on himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This arrest serves as a warning to anyone who attempts to profit from the tragedy at Sandy Hook," U.S. Attorney Deirdre M. Daly said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Federal prosecutors said Bruce collected the money through an online payment service and spent most of it on himself and his personal training business, rather than on the charity, as he promised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Authorities declined to provide the total amount collected by Bruce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The charity solicited donations through athletic events, such as one in New Hampshire, a "Schools 4 Schools" run, and another in Tennessee called "Cross Fit Cares."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Bruce promoted the events via social media, and solicited contributions through an online account by telling potential donors the purpose of the events was "to help raise funds for increased school safety, families of victims, memorials to teacher heroes, awareness and prevention in schools across America," federal prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bruce could face up to 20 years in prison on each count if convicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He could not be reached for immediate comment.</td></tr>

<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu's campaign hit by expenses claims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 15-minute film by Moshik Galamin showed Mr Netanyahu's wife Sara guiding the viewer around the couple's home, where run down parts of the property such as creaking doors and frayed carpets, are detailed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But it has now emerged Galamin was not granted access to the couple's upstairs living quarters, and Israel's Channel 10 TV claimed the kitchen in question was not even the one the Netanyahus use, but rather a secondary administrative kitchen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netanyahu's wife Sara bemoans the state of their kitchen in a home remodelling show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The embarrassing video forms just one of a series of damaging developments in Netanyahu's expenses controversy after an official watchdog criticised his spending of taxpayers' money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the clip, Sara Netanyahu unveils to interior designer Galamin a simple home with creaking doors and windows, frayed carpets, dusty lamps, cracked light fixtures and paint peeling off neglected walls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Galamin, who hosts a popular home remodeling TV show, said he funded the shoot - which opposition lawmakers say violated Israeli campaign finance laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A former chief of the Shin Bet security service called the film a 'severe security breach' and said terrorist groups would have been willing to pay a hefty sum to acquire such an inside look at the prime minister's home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Netanyahu's office had no immediate comment on the TV report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Netanyahu's rivals pounced on the material.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The centrist Yesh Atid party, which has made corruption a centerpiece of its campaign, said the report and video reflected how disconnected Netanyahu was from real problems of average Israelis, who just three years ago took to the streets en masse to protest the country's high cost of living.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'What matters are the citizens, not the carpets,' it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Meanwhile, the government's state comptroller has found 'excessive' amounts of public funds have been spent by Mr Netanyahu and his wife Sara, on food, furniture and gardening at their state residence and private home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In a report by the official watchdog, it was claimed cleaning expenses in the home on the coastal city of Caesarea averaged more than 1,370 a month in taxpayer's money even though the couple only spent the occasional weekend there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It was also said they pocketed proceeds from recycling bottles that had been purchased for entertaining official guests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It said the bottle returns, and purchases of garden furniture for their private home, may have violated the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The watchdog's findings have ramped up tensions between the premier and his opponents in the run -up to elections on March 17 which have focused on the economic woes of middle and lower-class voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Netanyahu promised to follow the recommendations to curb spending but he also criticised the 'ongoing media campaign' surrounding the report, which he said was aimed at toppling him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Netanyahu's opponents have tried to portray him as enjoying a lavish lifestyle and being out of touch with the struggles of average Israelis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Netanyahu's allies angrily dismissed the allegations as part of a campaign to deflect attention from important national security issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Netanyahu and his wife are no strangers to such scrutiny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The prime minister has long been saddled with an image as a cigar-smoking, cognac-drinking socialite, while his wife has come under fire for her own expensive tastes and alleged abusive behavior toward staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Netanyahus accuse the Israeli media of a longstanding witch hunt against them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In a statement, Netanyahu said he respected the findings of the comptroller and pledged to implement recommendations to curb wasteful spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>At the same time he lashed out at the 'ongoing media campaign' that he said is aimed at toppling him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>'There is absolutely no indication of any assault on the public's integrity and certainly no indication of any criminal transgressions,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A former member of their housekeeping staff has filed a lawsuit claiming he was mistreated and verbally abused by Sara Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In one instance, Meni Naftali alleged she called him at 3am to complain that he had bought milk in a plastic storage bag instead of a carton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In another, he claimed that she chastised him because some flowers in a vase were a day old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Over the years, reports have been released about the high cost of the Netanyahus' catering, housekeeping, furniture, clothing and makeup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In one case, the premier was chided for spending $127,000 in public funds for a special sleeping cabin on a flight to London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Even their costly purchases of scented candles and pistachio-flavored ice cream have been derided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Two days before the state comptroller released its report, Netanyahu posted a 15-minute video on Facebook that appeared aimed at countering the hedonistic image ahead of March 17 elections that have focused on the economic woes of middle and lower-class voters.</td></tr>
