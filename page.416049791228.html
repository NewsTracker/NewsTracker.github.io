<h3>Bodies of soldiers killed by Isis exhumed from Tikrit mass grave</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An Iraqi official says teams in the newly liberated city of Tikrit have started exhuming bodies from a mass grave believed to contain hundreds of soldiers killed by Islamic State militants last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>About 1,700 soldiers were captured by the extremists in June as they were trying to flee Camp Speicher, an air base on the outskirt of Tikrit that previously served as a US military facility, following an onslaught that stunned security forces and the military, which melted away as the militants advanced and captured key cities and towns in the country's north and west.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Then, the extremist group posted graphic photos that appeared to show its gunmen massacring scores of the soldiers after loading the captives onto flatbed trucks and then forcing them to lay face-down in a shallow ditch, their arms tied behind their backs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Other videos showed masked gunmen bringing the soldiers to a bloodstained concrete river waterfront inside the presidential palaces complex, shooting them in the head and throwing them into the Tigris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A few days after Iraqi security forces and allied Sunni and Shia fighters recaptured the city, government teams started on Monday opening up eight locations inside the complex where much of the killing is believed to have taken place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kamil Amin, a spokesman for Iraq's human rights ministry, said at least 12 dead bodies were exhumed on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He added that DNA samples were already taken from around 85% of the victims' families and lab test will be undergone shortly on the bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Iraqi state TV showed a number of masked men digging in an open area helped by bulldozers as family members stood nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Yellow tags were put on the remains next to flowers and candles lit by weeping troops and relatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The onslaught in June 2014 by Islamic State threw Iraq into its worst crisis since the 2011 US troop withdrawal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The militants also targeted Iraq's indigenous religious minorities, including Christians and followers of the ancient Yazidi faith, forcing tens of thousands from their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Since then, the Isis has carved out a self-styled caliphate in the large area straddling the Iraqi-Syrian border that it now controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In early August, the United States launched airstrikes on the militants in Iraq, in an effort to help Iraqi forces fight back against their growing threat.</td></tr>
