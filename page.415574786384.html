<tr><td>2</td><td>"I will never believe they did it, never," Zulai Gubasheva told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday at her home, wiping away tears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I didn't bring them up for this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The family lives in Ingushetia, an impoverished republic bordering Chechnya in the North Caucasus of southern Russia.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>"No, Anzor, don't do it, I don't want this for you, I don't want you always to be afraid for your life," Zulai Gubasheva said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"And he said: 'OK, Mom. Mom, I asked and you told me your opinion."</td></tr>

<h3>Ed Sheeran?s X smashes through the 2 million sales barrier</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This impressive achievement makes X only the fifth album to pass the two million mark since the start of the decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The other artists to have reached the monunemtal mile-stone since 2000 are Adele, Emeli Sande, Take That and Michael Buble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Currently touring in Australia, Ed said he was delighted with the news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"So chuffed to hear X has just hit the 2 million mark in the UK!</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Looking forward to getting back there for my Wembley shows in July and celebrating with you all."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This summer the star will perform solo at three sold-out solo shows at Wembley Stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Even more impressively, the feat was also achieved in remarkably quick time, taking just 38 weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Surprisingly, the second million sales were achieved quicker than the first, taking just 15 weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This boost in sales seems largely due to the success of the international hit Thinking Out Loud, which topped the charts last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ed's first album, +, is currently at 1.93 million, and is still selling at around 3-4,000 units per week, meaning that he should have two albums selling upwards of two milion copies by the end of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The only other UK artists who have managed that landmark are Robbie Williams, Coldplay, Adele, Take That and Dido, so Ed would be joining another exclusive group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The success of X also means Sheeran has two albums among the ten biggest selling albums of the 2010s so far - with X at Number 5 and + at Number 6.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Add in his two BRIT Awards for British Solo Male and Best Album of the Year and it's been a hell of a start to 2015 for the Suffolk superstar.</td></tr>
