<h3>Reds considering surgery for Homer Bailey's injured elbow (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CINCINNATI (AP) -- Reds right-hander Homer Bailey may require surgery on his pitching elbow, a significant setback to a team already struggling with its staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cincinnati is considering various options for treating an injured ligament in Bailey's right elbow, including surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Manager Bryan Price said on Tuesday that no decision had been made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Reds could wait and see if the elbow heals with treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''A lot of times, you want to kick the tires and make sure,'' Price said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''Not everything needs to be corrected with surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There are other ways to do things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''So there are some options out there beyond surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Either way, Bailey will miss a significant amount of time recovering from his latest elbow problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was in the clubhouse on Tuesday before a game against the Milwaukee Brewers and declined to be interviewed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It's been a tough two years for Bailey, who threw no-hitters in 2012 and 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He got a $105 million, six-year contract before last season and went 9-5 in 23 starts with a 3.71 ERA before surgery in September on the right forearm by the elbow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He was still recovering from the operation when spring training started, leaving him unable to fully work out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He opened the season on the disabled list, was activated and made two starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He threw 92 pitches in a 5-2 loss at St. Louis and 79 pitches in a 4-2 defeat at Milwaukee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Price said that Bailey's right elbow was a little sore after his last start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He was sent for an MRI on Monday that detected an injury to a ligament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Right-hander Michael Lorenzen will be called up to make his major league debut on Wednesday against Milwaukee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mike Leake was originally scheduled to pitch on Wednesday, with Bailey's spot coming up on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Leake has been pushed back a day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Reds were counting on a big year from Bailey, one of three returning starters along with Johnny Cueto and Leake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Reds traded Mat Latos to Miami and Alfredo Simon to Detroit in the offseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Cueto is in the final year of his contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Cincinnati's pitching staff ranks 12th in the National League with a 3.97 ERA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The bullpen has been the biggest problem, ranking last in the league with a 5.54 ERA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Reds also are limited at catcher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>All-Star Devin Mesoraco has been limited to pinch hitting for the last two weeks because of a sore left hip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It's unclear how long he'll be unable to catch.</td></tr>
