<h3>Landslide hits 6 villages in Nepal; 15 feared dead</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) - A landslide triggered by heavy rainfall buried six villages in Nepal's mountainous northeast, and at least 15 people sleeping in the homes are believed to have been killed, officials said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The landslide hit during the night in Taplejung district, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of the capital, Kathmandu, said government administrator Surendra Bhattarai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At least 15 people are feared to have died and several are missing, but details are sketchy because of the remoteness of the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The nearest town is at least five hours' away on foot when the weather is good, but getting to the site was taking much longer on Thursday because of rains and fog that prevented a rescue helicopter from landing, said Home Ministry official Laxmi Dhakal in Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There are no government offices or police stations in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Landslides are common in mountainous Nepal during the rainy monsoon season, which began in June and ends in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Himalayan nation is still recovering from earthquakes in April and May that killed more than 8,700 people and caused massive damage, with many of the roads cut off by landslides.</td></tr>
