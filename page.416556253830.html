<h3>Greece reshuffles EU/IMF negotiating team after Riga debacle</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece reshuffles EU/IMF negotiating team after Riga debacle Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Monday reshuffled his team handling talks with European and IMF lenders, after his finance minister was sharply criticized for his performance at a euro zone meeting last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tsipras and senior aides expressed support for Yanis Varoufakis and agreed the finance minister would supervise a new team negotiating a reforms deal with lenders, but appointed deputy Foreign Minister Euclid Tsakalotos as coordinator of the group, a government official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The appointment suggested Tsakalatos, an Oxford-educated economist and professor who is soft-spoken and well-liked by officials representing creditors, would have a more active role in face-to-face talks from now on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Varoufakis, a brash and outspoken economist who has rubbed many of his peers up the wrong way, was left isolated at a Eurogroup meeting in Riga and returned empty-handed at a time when Athens desperately needs new aid to avoid bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He was later criticized by media for failing to appear at a state dinner after the meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He responded by tweeting a quotation by American statesman Franklin Roosevelt which read "they are unanimous in their hate for me; and I welcome their hatred."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prominent conservative lawmaker Dora Bakoyannis was among those calling for his head, telling Skai TV that Varoufakis was a "drag" on the talks and that "the best thing he can do is to resign."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Support for Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who has been targeted by international media reports, was confirmed during the meeting," the government official said, referring to a Sunday meeting of Tsipras with top aides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The finance minister always acts in line with collective decisions and the government's leadership."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In another move suggesting a less prominent role for Varoufakis, his general secretary Nikos Theocharakis, who had been leading technical-level talks with the so-called Brussels Group of lenders, will now focus on drawing up a plan for growth to be the basis for a new deal with lenders in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>George Chouliarakis, considered close to the powerful deputy Prime Minister Yannis Dragasakis, will take over responsibility for talks with the Brussels group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In an effort to show that Athens is serious about giving lenders access to data, a new team was also set up to support EU and IMF officials gathering information in the Greek capital.</td></tr>
