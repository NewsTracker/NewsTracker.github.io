<h3>Friends: Man's death after arrest reveals Baltimore dynamics</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A member of the Baltimore Police Department stands guard outside of the department's Western District police station as men hold their hands up in protest during a march for Freddie Gray, Wednesday, April 22, 2015, in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gray died from spinal injuries about a week after he was arrested and transported in a police van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - Slight and slender at just 5-feet 8-inches and 145 pounds, 25-year-old Freddie Gray was a warm, funny, generous figure in Baltimore's predominantly poor and African American Sandtown community, his friends and relatives said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The young man who died of traumatic spinal injury a week after his April 12 arrest used to give his hand-me-down clothes to younger children and crack jokes whenever anyone was having a bad day, they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But as demonstrators poured into Baltimore's streets following Gray's death, community members said Gray - who like many of his peers also had a criminal record - symbolizes the experiences of many black men in Baltimore, living in poverty and in fear of the police who patrol their neighborhoods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"He was a typical Sandtown kid," said Sean Price, who grew up there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He wasn't perfect, but neither is anybody. This isn't anything new. Freddie Gray is just a microcosm of what happens every day in Sandtown, in Baltimore."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Gray was arrested April 12 after police "made eye contact" with him and another man in an area known for drug activity, police said, and both men started running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gray was handcuffed and put in a transport van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Exactly what happened in the van and how he was injured are still unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But he died a week later in a hospital of what police described as "a significant spinal injury."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The six officers involved in the arrest have been suspended with pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Attorney Michael Davey, whose firm contracts with the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police, said five of the six gave voluntary statements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Davey said all six are under criminal investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Demonstrators who have protested peacefully against Gray's death for several days took to the streets again Wednesday in two separate actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As one group cursed at police and threw some soda cans at them at a police barricade, another marched 20 blocks to City Hall, at times blocking intersections and disruption traffic as they shouted: "No justice, no peace."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Bernadette Washington, who said she has been marching every day since Gray's death, said: "All we want is justice."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday that it will investigate to determine whether police violated Gray's civil rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Local authorities have promised to conduct a transparent investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>At a news conference Wednesday, Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 President Gene Ryan acknowledged a need "to improve the relationship between the police department and the community," and said most police officers "are very professional, highly trained and self-motivated."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Sandtown neighborhood in West Baltimore surrounds blocks of red-brick public housing called the Gilmor Homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Trees are sparse amid abandoned lots overgrown with grass and crumbling, burned-out row homes, their doors and windows boarded up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>James Brown, who lives across from the corner where Gray was arrested, said he saw Gray taken away in the police van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Brown said the community has many questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>As a boy, friends said, Gray loved to play sports, and was on the football team at Carver Vocational-Technical High School.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Childhood friend William Stewart, who had known Gray for 20 years, said he "laughed all day and smiled all the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Gray also had several drug-related convictions and was scheduled to appear in court on a recent charge in May. In high-crime areas like Sandtown, residents say criminal records are not uncommon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"He also had his troubles, but so does everybody," Stewart said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"I have a criminal record. But if I'm walking down the street minding my own business and the police kill me, does that have anything to do with it?"</td></tr>
