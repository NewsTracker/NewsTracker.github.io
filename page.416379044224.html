<h3>North Carolina man's obituary: 'Do not vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>And in his obituary, his family made just two requests: please donate to a children's hospital, and please don't vote for Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Upright, a staunch Republican, died Monday at a North Carolina hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He was 81.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"In lieu of flowers, memorials may be sent to Shriners Hospital for Children," his obituary reads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Also, the family respectfully asks that you do not vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016. R.I.P. Grandaddy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Daughter Jill McLain said it was natural to put that line in her father's tribute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He was very passionate about politics and probably passed a little of that on," she told CNN affiliate WSOC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Son Michael Upright said he knew his father would enjoy the request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We know he's up there giggling right now, just laughing out loud," he told WSOC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Upright's passions included much more than just politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>His greatest joy was his family, and he was a former Shriner of the Year at the Cabarrus Shrine Club, according to his obituary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After retiring from the building automation industry, he became an avid golfer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But it's the last few lines of his obituary that is spurred comments from across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"You have my solemn promise I will not waste a vote on Hillary Clinton," Marina Shear of Dallas wrote in the obituary's online guestbook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"You were a wise man, Larry Upright," said Ron Renno of Forsyth, Georgia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I will remember your request in November 2016. Rest in peace, Sir."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Nigel Dufont of Kannapolis, North Carolina, offered his condolences but said he wouldn't budge on his support of Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"So sorry to hear about Larry, but I am still voting for Hilary!" he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"May you rest in peace. I will vote for Hillary if she is the best candidate."</td></tr>
