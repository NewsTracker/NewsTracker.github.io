<h3>Iraqi militia loyal to radical cleric joins Tikrit offensive</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Iraqi military officials have said they expect to reach the center of Tikrit within two to three days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BAGHDAD (AP) - Dozens of fighters with the militia loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr left Iraq's capital Sunday to take part in an offensive to capture Tikrit from the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Men from Iraq's Peace Brigade left to the Shiite holy city of Samarra, the launching point for operations to recapture Saddam Hussein's hometown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>About a dozen heavily armed trucks packed with fighters left Baghdad earlier Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are traveling to help the community of Muslims and to help the people of Iraq," said Ali al-Mousawi, a spokesman for the brigade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Iraqi troops and Iranian-backed Shiite militias launched a long-awaited offensive this month aimed at retaking Tikrit, a Sunni bastion on the Tigris River whose capture would pave the way for an assault on Mosul, which U.S. officials have said could come as soon as next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tikrit and Mosul have been under the control of the Islamic State group since it swept across northern Iraq in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The extremists hold a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Iraqi officials say that at least 30,000 men - including soldiers, Shiite militiamen, Sunni tribes and police officers - are fighting to seize Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>U.S. Gen. Martin Dempsey said Wednesday that at least 20,000 militiamen are taking part in the offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Earlier this month, New York-based Human Rights Watch called on the Iraqi government to protect civilians in Tikrit and allow them to flee combat zones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Its statement noted "numerous atrocities" against Sunni civilians by pro-government militias and security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Al-Sadr, who comes from a line of influential Shiite clerics, heads the militia previously known as the Mahdi Army, a paramilitary force he formed in 2003 in a show of resistance against the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Last month, he announced that he would withdraw the Peace Brigade from fighting in a "show of goodwill" following accusations that the militias were responsible for battlefield atrocities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Al-Mousawi said the Peace Brigade are looking to fight alongside Tikrit's Sunni tribes to liberate the city, saying: "It's them who should lead this fight, since Tikrit is where their homes and families are."</td></tr>

<h3>'Cinderella' reigns at the box office</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Cinderella" enchanted audiences this weekend, racking up a royal $70.1 million to lead the domestic box office and $132 million globally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The adaptation of the fairy tale follows Walt Disney Studios' strategy of raiding its animated favorites for live action blockbusters -- an approach that led to such prior successes as "Maleficent" and "Alice in Wonderland," and one the studio plans to employ on "Dumbo" and "Beauty and the Beast."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Cinderella's" popularity left Liam Neeson's latest action-adventure, "Run All Night," huffing and puffing at the finish line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Warner Bros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>release pulled in a lackluster $11 million from 3,171 theaters, lower than pre-release tracking which suggested a debut in the $15 million range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The audience was 52% female and 86% over the age of 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Warner Bros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>domestic distribution chief Dan Fellman said he was particularly surprised that the film attracted more women than to men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He said the picture seemed to play better on the East Coast in cities like Washington D.C. and New York than it did on the West Coast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I'm a little disappointed in the results," said Fellman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We just got off to a slow start...we felt it should have been a stronger second place, but at this point we're hoping we get a good multiple and a great hold."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It's possible that Neeson, who was recently seen making short work of European bad guys in January's "Taken 3," has simply been brandishing the gun a bit too much of late.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Run All Night" cost $50 million to produce, so it will need to attract foreign crowds if it wants to break even.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Cinderella" opened across 3,845 theaters in North America and cost $95 million to produce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It couldn't match the $116.1 million debut of "Alice in Wonderland," but it did surpass the $69.4 million premiere of "Maleficent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That's impressive considering that it lacked a star on the level of Johnny Depp or Angelina Jolie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It also cost a fraction of the roughly $200 million each that Disney spent producing those fantasies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Cinderella" was a juggernaut overseas picking up an estimated $62.4 million, $25 million of which came from China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The film opened in about 60 percent of the international marketplace, including such major territories as Russia, Italy, Mexico and Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In the holdover realm, "Kingsman: The Secret Service" has now crossed the $100 million mark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Fox action-adventure captured third place with $6.2 million, pushing its stateside haul to $107.4 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Focus," Will Smith's heist romance, snagged fourth position on the charts with $5.8 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>release has made $44 million after three weeks in theaters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Fifth place went to Fox Searchlight's "The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" which held steady with $5.7 million from 2,022 theaters in its sophomore frame, dropping a mere 33% and bringing its total to $18.1 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In limited release, Radius-TWC's "It Follows" impressed with $163,453 from four locations, for a per-screen average of $40,863.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The horror film has enjoyed unusually strong reviews for the genre, with critics handing out a 95% "fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.</td></tr>
