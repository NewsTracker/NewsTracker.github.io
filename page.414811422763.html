<h3>Bali Nine: Indonesian Attorney-General delays transfer of pair but insists no delay in execution</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The families of the Bali Nine drug smugglers facing execution have been given extra time to spend with the men, but the country's attorney general insists that they are not planning to delay their appointment with a firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Attorney-General HM Prasetyo told Fairfax Media that he had taken the decision to override the actions of the Bali prosecutors office to swiftly transfer Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to Nusakambangan island in Central Java, where the executions will take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The office had flagged that the transfer to the maximum security Butu prison on the penal island could take place as early as Tuesday and would happen this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We are responding to the requests from the Australian government and families," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We want the families to meet with Myuran and Andrew, to give them more time to be with the convicts on death row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This is not delaying the executions. This is just to provide the families with more time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Asked how much more time the families would be granted, Mr Prasetyo said: "I don't know when. It's up to the Bali prosecutor's office. They are in charge of the transfer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Bali office could not be immediately reached for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As for the timing of the executions, Mr Prasetyo said it had yet to be confirmed and refused to be drawn on whether they will be this month, as his office had indicated in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We don't have a date."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But he remained resolute that the executions would be carried out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This is not something easy. This is not something fun but this is what we must do," he told Fairfax Media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran have lodged two separate appeals against their death sentences in the past fortnight.</td></tr>
