<h3>Czech president, US envoy in rare public spat over Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In an interview with online publication Parlamentni Listy on Sunday, Zeman bristled at the envoy's implied criticism of his decision to attend Moscow's traditional May 9 military parade despite the crisis in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Zeman said U.S. Ambassador Andrew Shapiro is no longer welcome in the Prague Castle, the seat of presidency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Parliament's lower house speaker, Jan Hamacek, said he thought Zeman was overreacting; the deputy speaker of Parliament's upper house, Premysl Sobotka, said Monday Zeman proved a lack of "diplomatic thinking."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jan Mlejnek, an analyst, said Zeman's rhetoric was unfortunate and will harm Czech-U.S. relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In an emailed statement from the U.S. embassy, Shapiro said "it would be unfortunate for President Zeman to be there as perhaps? the only EU head of state."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Zeman, whose is critical of European Union sanctions against Russia, said he wanted to honor Soviet soldiers who sacrificed their lives to liberate his country in World War II.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Czech presidency is a largely ceremonial post and the government is in charge of foreign policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said he accepted Zeman's explanation for the trip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Shapiro said he regretted that Zeman felt offended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I value a good working relationship with everyone, and I want him to know that my door will be open to him,"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Shapiro said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I also want the Czech people to know that the United States government, and the people of America, value our relationship as partners and allies more than ever."</td></tr>
