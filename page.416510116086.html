<h3>Each death in Baltimore makes mistrust harder to overcome</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Baltimore Police Department Commissioner Anthony Batts speaks about the investigation into Freddie Gray's death at a news conference, Friday, April 24, 2015, in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gray died from spinal injuries about a week after he was arrested and transported in a police van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - Baltimore's mayor and police commissioner came in making big promises to the inner-city residents and police who spent decades staring each other down in neighborhoods ravaged by crack and heroin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But with each death of a black man in custody, their efforts to overcome mistrust have hit hard walls of skepticism and outrage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Two and a half years into his job leading the city's police department, Commissioner Anthony Batts is frustrated that the people he was appointed to serve have lost their faith in justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"They don't believe what I say," Batts said in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake hired Batts in September 2012 after a previous round of police scandals involving excessive use of force, and she was still supporting her commissioner ahead of more protests Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Batts also rejected demands by several African-American ministers that he resign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"That's not going to happen," he announced Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He promised to be as transparent as possible without compromising an investigation that could lead to criminal charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Six officers have been suspended with pay since Freddie Gray died of a spinal injury he suffered during an arrest Batts characterized as questionable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Both Batts and the mayor, who took office in 2010, are African-American and no strangers to communities like Sandtown, a set of public housing projects not far from Baltimore's Inner Harbor and the Orioles' baseball stadium where Gray tried to outrun three bicycle cops who spotted him on a street corner on April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Gray, 25, was pinned to the ground and already injured when he was handcuffed and hoisted into a van, police acknowledged Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He repeatedly begged for medical help, but officers instead added leg irons and locked him inside again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Gray was eventually hospitalized in critical condition, and died a week later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Batts, who spent decades policing in Long Beach and Oakland, California, before taking this job, insists he is part of the solution in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said he's fired 50 police employees and reduced officer-involved shootings, and the use-of-force reports police must file dropped from 598 in 2012 to 435 in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I have been a reform commissioner. I have taken an organization that has many challenges and faced them head-on," he insisted, even as he acknowledged that some cases have "tarnished this badge and the reputation of the department."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>With each death in custody and each police brutality settlement, the trust erodes even more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A Baltimore Sun investigation revealed last year that the city has paid roughly $5.7 million in brutality settlements since 2011, involving 102 instances of excessive force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And taxpayers keep paying: Just days after Gray's death, the city's Board of Estimates approved $80,000 for 37-year-old Timothy Ashe, whose teeth were punched out by police officer after parking illegally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A week earlier, $175,000 was awarded to the family of Michael Wudtee, who was fatally shot by an officer at a gas station in July 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>- Tyrone West, 44, died in July 2013; he stopped breathing after he was tackled and handcuffed by officers during a traffic stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The autopsy blamed a heart condition aggravated by the struggle and hot temperatures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>An internal review board said the officers were justified, but said officers "made several tactical errors."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>West's family is suing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>- Anthony Anderson, 46, died in September 2012 after police said they broke up his drug deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Officers said he fought with them and was slammed to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>His death, of internal bleeding from blunt force injuries, was ruled a homicide, but an internal review board ruled officers were justified, and prosecutors declined to charge them.</td></tr>
