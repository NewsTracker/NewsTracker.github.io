<h3>Al-Qaeda-linked militants kill four police officers in Tunisia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It was the first deadly assault this year on government forces in Tunisia, where the police and the army have been hunting down jihadists blamed for a string of attacks on security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"A group of 20 terrorists attacked a patrol of the National Guard" early on Wednesday, two kilometres from Kasserine, which lies at the foot of Mount Chaambi, said interior ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The gunmen opened fire at a police car, killing the four policemen, and fled with their weapons, the spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Aroui said the attackers were members of the al-Qaeda-linked Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade, the main Tunisian armed group active along the border with Algeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There will be a severe and violent response," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the assault, but a Twitter account close to Okba Ibn Nafaa praised the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"God be praised, a patrol of the pagan [police] was attacked near Mount Chaambi and four [policemen] killed," the account said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tunisia has seen a rise in Islamist extremism since the 2011 revolution that ousted veteran strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Dozens of police and military personnel have been killed or wounded in attacks blamed on Islamist militants around the Chaambi range, but also further north along the border with Algeria.</td></tr>
