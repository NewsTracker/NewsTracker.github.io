<h3>S&P upgrades Greece's credit rating after European bailout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Standard & Poor's has raised Greece's credit rating after a European bailout reduced the chances of the country's government defaulting on its massive debts during the next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece's rating now stands at "CCC+" in an upgrade announced Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That classification means Greece is still on shaky financial ground, but less likely to face an immediate credit crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>S&P had previously rated Greece as "CCC-," a category signaling that loan payments are likely to be missed within six months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece was on the brink of reneging on part of its national debt of 320 billion euro ($347 billion) earlier this month until agreeing to a series of concessions to obtain short-term financing from other European nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>S&P still believes there is a one-in-three chance that Greece will leave the eurozone.</td></tr>
