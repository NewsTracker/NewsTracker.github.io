<h3>Patient in Barrie, Ont., isolated for possible Ebola infection</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BARRIE, Ont.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>-- A patient at Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre in Barrie, Ont., has been been transferred to one of the province's designated Ebola response centres this evening, an RVH release states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>According to the release, the patient, who had recently returned from West Africa, arrived at the emergency department via ambulance late Saturday morning with symptoms which prompted paramedics and RVH to enact Ebola protocols.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Paramedics were alerted to the potential risk, albeit low, through dispatch and wore full protective equipment when handling the patient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In accordance with the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care's guidelines, and in consultation with the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit, the patient was transferred directly to RVH's decontamination unit and was then cared for in a negative pressure trauma room, dedicated to suspect Ebola cases, the release states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The patient was treated by a specialized team who were not caring for any other patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>RVH officials say at no time did the patient enter the emergency department triage or waiting area, and all other patients were moved from the dedicated trauma wing before the patient arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Although the risk is considered low-risk the patient will be tested to rule out Ebola at the designated centre.</td></tr>
