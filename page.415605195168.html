<h3>Boko Haram 'slaughter wives' in Nigeria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Niger, Cameroon and Chad have launched a regional military campaign to help Nigeria defeat the Boko Haram insurgency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Maiduguri: Dozens of Nigerian women who were forced to marry Boko Haram fighters have reportedly been slaughtered by their "husbands" before a battle with troops in the northeast town of Bama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Five witnesses who recounted the massacres said the Islamist militants feared they would be killed by advancing soldiers or separated from their wives when they fled the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They killed the women to prevent them from subsequently marrying soldiers or other so-called non-believers, they added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The terrorists said they will not allow their wives to be married to infidels," said Sharifatu Bakura, 39, a mother of three.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nigeria's military along with forces from neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger have claimed huge victories over the insurgents in recent weeks but defenceless civilians still face serious threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>According to Ms Bakura's account, which was supported by others, Boko Haram fighters received word of a military assault on Bama, formerly an Islamist stronghold in Borno state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The insurgents had decided to flee to the nearby town of Gwoza before the troops' arrival but first decided "to kill their wives so that nobody will remarry them", she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ms Bakura's husband was killed by the insurgents four months ago but she was spared from a forced marriage because she was visibly pregnant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Boko Haram forcibly married scores of women in Bama after seizing it in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nigeria's military announced the recapture of the town on Monday.</td></tr>

<h3>'SOB' bankers should be punished: Wall St watchers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Personally punish the industry's bad apples, according to two longtime observers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I think we need to personalize the penalties for those who are sinners. It's got to hurt them individually," Charles Ellis, a prominent investment consultant and author, said at an event this week in New York on improving the financial industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ellis, who founded institutional advisor Greenwich Associates, said that new laws after the financial crisis didn't go far enough because companies-usually via public stock owners-still pay penalties for misbehavior, not people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We've got to get past the idea of sending it against shareholders and writing it off the balance sheet," Ellis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>John Rogers, former CEO of the CFA Institute and previously a top Invesco executive, agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Making senior management personally responsible resonates with me. That's true for actors down inside the banks too. They need to be apprehended, tried and punished," Rogers explained, speaking alongside Ellis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rogers added that misbehavior would happen again, making existing oversight mechanisms important.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"To think that the banking system is ever going to have just white hats on is unfortunately not going to happen. That's why there are safety nets in place to help deal with that," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The safety nets that Rogers referred to include federal oversight put in place after the financial crisis, including higher cash reserve requirements for banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While Ellis took a harder tone, he did note that most people on Wall Street are ethical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's a very small fraction of people, and usually with a very small fraction of their time, that did things that were really crummy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Still, Ellis was highly critical of certain behavior before the financial crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have had some real SOBs," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ellis gave the examples of former Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld, who now acts as a deal consultant at a small firm he founded, Matrix Advisors in Manhattan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He also called the "former CEO of Merrill Lynch"-presumably Stan O'Neal-"probably one of the most despicably behaved human beings we've ever seen in this country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>O'Neal famously left Merrill Lynch with $161 million in accumulated benefits as the bank fell into crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>O'Neal has largely disappeared from public view besides serving on the board of metal company Alcoa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>(The next CEO was John Thain; Ellis later declined to clarify which executive he meant.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"You think, what penalties have they paid? Maybe a little embarrassment with their kids' friends who all know what happened, sort of," Ellis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Most of it has been a free pass."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ellis also mentioned former Goldman Sachs trader Fabrice Tourre, who was punished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Tourre was found liable for defrauding investors in mortgage-backed securities; he paid a fine and is now pursuing a doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Ellis said if Tourre's supervisors had been more afraid of personal penalties, they would likely have spotted and prevented his actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A spokesman for Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A spokesman for Goldman Sachs did not respond to a request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Fuld did not respond to a request for comment left with his assistant at Matrix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Tourre did not respond to an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Attempts to contact O'Neal were unsuccessful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Is Wall Street Broken?</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Is Wall Street's culture completely broken?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>John Taft, RBC U.S. Wealth Management CEO, discusses what he calls, "the lost culture of Wall Street," and why it's keeping investors away.</td></tr>
