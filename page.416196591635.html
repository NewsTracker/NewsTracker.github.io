<h3>ROAD TRIP! Hillary Clinton starts presidential campaign with 1,000-mile journey to rural Iowa in a VAN, and poses for pics at a gas station!</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>They'll have to watch the exit ramps instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The former secretary of state left her Chappaqua, New York manse Sunday afternoon in a van, poised for a 1,046-mile trip to rural Iowa and a series of Hillary sightings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In January 2014 she told a car-dealer trade show audience that she hadn't driven a car since her days as first lady, making it likely that Hillary will either ride shotgun or stretch out in the back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'I have to confess that one of the regrets I have about my public life is that I can't drive anymore,' she said last year in New Orleans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'Last time I actually drove a car myself was 1996,' she added, 'and I remember it very well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton's campaign aides tried to keep the down-home mode of transportation a secret, but a college student did them in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Penn State Altoona student Chris Learn, 19, told CNN that he saw Clinton at a gas station, and that she chatted him up with questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Campaign staff briefed donors and hand-picked reporters during the trip on Sunday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'When Hillary first told us that she was ready to hit the road for Iowa, we looked at her and said: "Seriously?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>' senior aide Huma Abedin said, according to Agence-France Presse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'And she said: "Seriously."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This was her idea, and she has been really excited about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A nameless aide told Politico that the spectacle of Hillary Clinton being chauffeured one-third of the way across the country could become chaotic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'We know at some point she'll get OJ'ed like the White Bronco,' the staffer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In Monticello, Clinton will participate in what her campaign is calling a 'roundtable with students and educators' on Tuesday at a satellite campus of Kirkwood Community College.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A day later it will be a 'small business roundtable' at Capital City Fruit in the town of Norwalk, south of Des Moines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The public will be shut out of both events, and only a handful of reporters will be allowed in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A Hillary staffer said the boss was calling the shots when it came to travel, saying 'it's her idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois beckon en route, with Interstate 80 passing near or through State College - home to Penn State University - and then the Ohio cities of Youngstown, Cleveland and Toledo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Clinton's Indiana swing will likely take her through South Bend, the hoe of Notre Dame University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>From there it's a quick swing past Chicago, on to Daveport, Iowa, and a short jaunt along the back roads to Monticello.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>That pitch is a daring one, given Clinton's wealth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>When she left the U.S. State Department in 2013, her financial disclosure report showed that her combined net worth with her husband was between $5.2 and $25.5 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Millions more rolled in when she published her memoirs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>She famously claimed last year that she and former president Bill Clinton were 'dead broke' whenthey left the White House in 2001 - when they moved into a palatial home in a tree-lined New York City suburb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Clinton's chief of staff John Podesta pushed a similar 'middle-class' message, but stepped on her announcement with his own email to a group of donors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>'I wanted to make sure you heard it first from me -- it's official: Hillary's running for president,' Podesta wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Podesta leads the Podesta Group, one of Washington's most powerful lobbying firms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama until February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Clinton, too, is part of the upper-crust of America's wealth pool, earning millions since she left public office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Clinton's slow roll into the 2016 race toko a pass on a splashy announcement of the kind that Republicans are staging for cheering throngs this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>That strategy will help her skirt the kind of uncomfortable media questions that tend to dog anyone named Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>There will be no press conferences, no grand speeches until at least early May, and few interviews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>'In May, once her supporters in all 50 states are organized for house parties or to watch over live-streams,' the statement said, 'Hillary will hold her first rally and deliver the speech to kick off her campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In a sign of her campaign's fundraising trajectory - her insiders are said to be eyeing a staggering $2.5 billion war chest - a political action committee called HillaryPAC had its first solicitation email out 18 minutes before the campaign's own press release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The campaign's announcement to reporters, perhaps finished in haste, included an embarrassing mistake in the omission of a key word.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Clinton, the presumptive Democratic favorite, has a storied and rocky relationship with the press, one that sometimes brings out snippiness, mistrust and a temper that her handlers are loath to provoke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But 'Hillary' sports a one-name celebrity ID, like Madonna or Beyonce; she doesn't need the TV time to build name-recognition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Republicans were quick on the trigger with their opening salvos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>'Americans need a president they can trust and voters do not trust Hillary Clinton,' Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>'The Clintons believe they can play by a different set of rules and think they're above transparency, accountability, and ethics,' Priebus said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Ted Cruz, the fire-breathing Texas GOP senator who was the first major party candidate to join the race, blasted her in a Web video of his own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>'Russia is now a more powerful adversary than it was when she became secretary of state,' Fiorina said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>'Our relationship with Israel has deteriorated dramatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>'She's not the woman for the White House,' she charged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>With initial campaign swings in Iowa and New Hampshire, Clinton will try to claim a mantle that has eluded her for the last 15 years: empathizer-in-chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Her campaign handlers are planning small-scale 'listening tour' stops like those that opened up her successful 2000 Senate campaign in New York, a state where she had never lived before she campaigned there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>New Yorkers didn't know much about her, aside from her stand-by-your-man turn following her husband's infidelities and her trademark 'Hillarycare' push - a failed proposal for a nationwide medical overhaul whose mandates, fines and tax-code changes make today's Obamacare program look modest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>She fixed that by nodding, smiling, listening and scribbling in notebooks that Democrats say were inspirations for her later policy preferences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Iowans know her just as sparsely today: She has been to the state just once since her 2008 presidential campaign crashed and burned, despite a massive campaign war chest, touched off when a first-term Illinois senator named Obama lit the fuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>For now they'll be watching her lug around 'dynasty' baggage, making the case that a second Clinton presidency wouldn't make for a royal line of succession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>She'll face tough questions about a private email account on a home-brew server that she exclusively used while she was secretary of state - an arrangement that provided her with an opportunity to hide tens of thousands of messages from government archivists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Then there are her more substantial ties with the Obama administration's increasingly unpopular foreign policy, and her proximity to institutional failures like the deadly 2012 terror attacks on one of her State Department outposts in Benghazi, Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>'I think she would continue the policies of this president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>... she empowered a failed foreign policy,' South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday on CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>'If she can make a case that she's different from him, she has a chance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>If she can't, then "game, set, match".</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Graham is himself a likely entrant in the Republican nomination sweepstakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>He challenged reporters to vet Mrs. Clinton more thoroughly than they did the current president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>He also joked to a crowd of 4,000 that Clinton's campaign should make its first new hire a director of email security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Hillary lacks the 'cool' factor of her husband Bill, who played the saxophone on the Arsenio Hall show and famously told an MTV audience about his underwear preferences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>The former president pitched himself in 1991 and 1992 as a 'New Democrat' -- neither too far right nor too far left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>But at age 69, Hilary is seen as an old Democrat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>She would be the second-oldest U.S. president if she were to win it all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>The cool Democrat this time around is Martin O'Malley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>The former Maryland governor's visits to Iowa are punctuated by appearances fronting a saloon band in dusty suburbs - guitar pick in one hand, campaign literature in the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>And he's not sounding like a vice-presidential wannabee, or like a one-time Baltimore mayor whose political train stopped at the state capitol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>'I kind of like big odds and tough fights,' he said Thursday in Indianola, a college town south of Des Moines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Clinton fared poorly eight years ago in Iowa college towns like Ames and Indianola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>This time no one will be surprised if she turns in even worse numbers there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Iowa voters won't do their caucusing until next year, and meanwhile they need to be cajoled, coddled, pursued and hugged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>There is no coronation-in-waiting, only a grueling 99-county marathon that Clinton can only win if she convinces the state's Democrats that she'll run all 26.2 miles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Clinton's ties to the Obama administration will not likely help her, from her now-infamous secretive email practices to her participation in the mop-up after the Benghazi disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>But Obama, long suspected of holding grudges from two elections ago, spoke well of her on Saturday at a press conference during the Summit of the Americas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>'She was a formidable candidate in 2008, he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>'She was a great supporter of mine in the general election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>She was an outstanding secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>'I think she would be an excellent president,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>Even if Hillary should overcome her intra-party squabbles, she would face a Republican who emerged from a crowded field and could be just as well-funded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>She already has problems in Iowa, with newly minted candidate Rand Paul, a Kentucky senator, beating her there in hypothetical head-to-head polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>And in order to squash an O'Malley or Warren insurgency, Clinton may have to move far enough to the political left to give the GOP more ammunition two autumns from now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>However Hillary's first weeks as a candidate go, however, Americans already got a view of her on Saturday Night Live in the person of comic actress Kate McKinnon.</td></tr>
