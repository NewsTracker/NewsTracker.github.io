<h3>Baltimore police give prosecutors report on Freddie Gray's death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE - Baltimore police have handed prosecutors the findings of an internal investigation into the death of a black man who suffered spinal injuries while in custody, officials said on Thursday, a day after protests spread to other cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Police have said there were no plans to make the findings public, but the report was turned over to Baltimore City's chief prosecutor a day earlier than expected, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I understand the frustration, I understand the sense of urgency," Batts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"That is why we have finished it a day ahead of time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Batts said the police investigation of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray on April 19 was not over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prosecutors have said they would conduct their own investigation before deciding whether to charge six police officers involved in Gray's arrest on April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gray's death has become the latest flashpoint in a nationwide debate about police use of lethal force and race relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Protests spread to other major cities on Wednesday for the first time since Gray died, a reprise of demonstrations that broke out last year after police killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, New York and elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>More than 100 people were arrested in New York overnight on Wednesday as protesters fanned out across Manhattan after a rally, briefly disrupting traffic in places.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Baltimore police commissioner made the announcement about the report after a curfew held for a second night and relative calm returned to the predominantly African-American city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Looting, arson and street clashes with police roiled Baltimore on Monday after Gray's funeral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Thursday morning, thousands of National Guard troops and police remained in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the police presence was noticeably lighter than Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On the street corner in West Baltimore where a CVS pharmacy burned and the worst of the rioting took place, only a dozen city police officers in normal patrol uniforms were on the street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Authorities say Gray was running from police and when caught, transported to a police station in a van with no seat restraint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He suffered a spinal injury and died in the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A lawyer for Gray's family says his spine was 80 percent severed at the neck while in custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In Baltimore, the outrage has ratcheted up expectations that there would be a quick answer on the fate of the six police officers involved in Gray's arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The officers have been suspended, and the U.S. Justice Department is investigating the incident for possible civil rights violations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We are confident that our state's attorney is going to do what needs to be done," said State Senator Catherine Pugh, who has been a frequent presence on Baltimore's streets the last two nights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Pugh said the office of Marilyn Mosby, the state's attorney for the city, had to be given time to complete the probe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>New York City police said early on Thursday most of the arrests were for disorderly conduct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The demonstrations from Union Square to Times Square and elsewhere, recalled protests in December after a grand jury decided against charges in the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died after a police officer put him in a chokehold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Smaller protests were held in Boston, Houston, Ferguson, Washington, D.C., and Seattle, and a handful of demonstrators were arrested in Denver on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>During Thursday's press conference, Baltimore police also revised their timeline of events that unfolded before Gray received medical attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Officials said the van in which Gray was riding after his arrest made an additional, previously undisclosed stop en route to a police booking center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Officials said they only learned about the stop from a private video taken along the van's route.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Washington Post reported on Wednesday night that a prisoner who was in the same van as Gray, but who could not see him, heard him banging against the walls and believed he was intentionally trying to injure himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The newspaper cited a document written by a police investigator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Police have arrested close to 270 people since Monday's violence, 18 of them on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Police said more than 100 people had been released without being charged because officials could not keep up with the paperwork, but he said charges would be brought later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The unrest in Baltimore prompted national figures - from the new U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton - to vow to work on improving law enforcement and criminal justice in minority communities.</td></tr>
