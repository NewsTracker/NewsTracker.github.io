<h3>You can match with a robot on Tinder at SXSW</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>There a whole slew of people in Austin from out of town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nobody's going to be there for that long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>For some, it might be a good time to do some swiping on Tinder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>OK there are a couple red flags in this conversation right away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>First, Ava has the grammar and capitalization habits of your grandmother, and the way she speaks (er, types) is oddly cadenced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Plus there's that whole thing where she asks Brock "what makes you human."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Like, maybe we should wonder if she is human.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Assuming that Brock followed Ava's last instruction to check out her Instagram, he would have been lead to a page consisting of promotional materials for the film Ex Machina, a sci-fi flick about a robot premiering at SXSW (and he might have been like, "Oh").</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The "Ava" in the Tinder photos is actually Swedish actress Alicia Vikander, who plays an artificial intelligence in Ex Machina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>So it's either a brilliant marketing scheme or kind of creepy and invasive, since basically the movie is trolling users on a dating app, and potentially preventing them from meeting IRL women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Either way, adding "must not be a robot" to your Tinder profile might be a good idea if you're in Austin.</td></tr>
