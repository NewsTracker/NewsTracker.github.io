<h3>ISIS loses battle for Tikrit as government forces raise flag in city</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Iraq claims it has liberated the city of Tikrit - its biggest victory in the fight against Islamic State terrorists to date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Security and allied forces, backed by U.S.-led coalition aircraft retook the hometown of former president Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi tricolour was raised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The operation began on March 2 and had looked bogged down before Iraqi forces made rapid advances over the past 48 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi 'announces the liberation of Tikrit and congratulates Iraqi security forces and popular volunteers on the historic milestone', his official Twitter account said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He was referring to paramilitary groups which played a major role in the fighting to retake Tikrit, a Sunni Arab city which ISIS had controlled since it captured swathes of Iraq in June last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Iraqiya state television showed footage of houses previously used by the terror group in liberated areas, but it was not clear whether any pockets of resistance remained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The provincial government headquarters was retaken on Monday, and on Tuesday the Iraqi tricolour replaced the black ISIS flag on the building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>There no immediate information on how many fighters were killed, wounded or captured in the fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The government has not provided any casualty figures since the operation started a month ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Iraqi army and police forces, as well as volunteers and Iran-backed Shiite militias, completely surrounded Tikrit within two weeks of launching the operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There was a lull in fighting when government and allied forces apparently balked at the number of snipers, booby traps and trenches which ISIS was using to defend the city centre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Iran was Baghdad's top foreign partner in the early stages of the operation, but Iraqi air force strikes were proving insufficient to break the back of IS resistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The government eventually requested strikes from the U.S.-led coalition which has been assisting Iraqi forces elsewhere in the country since August last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>American jets began bombing ISIS targets in Tikrit on March 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>France also took part in the campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The move sparked a freeze in the participation of the Popular Mobilisation units, an umbrella organisation for volunteers and militias which accounted for the bulk of the manpower involved in the Tikrit battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Pentagon had expressed unease at the role played by Iran and its proxies in the battle and said it conditioned its intervention on regular forces taking the lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Friday, it hailed the withdrawal from the fight of 'those Shiite militias who are linked to, infiltrated by, (or) otherwise under the influence of Iran'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But after giving themselves political cover by declaring that they do not want to work with each other, both sides took part in the Tikrit operation this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Tikrit, which once had an estimated population of around 200,000, had been largely emptied of civilians by the time the government operation was launched at the start of March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The fate of those who were believed to have remained in the city was unclear on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Thousands of people displaced last year or more recently from Salaheddin province, of which Tikrit is the capital, have started returning to their homes in outlying liberated areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But the level of destruction Tikrit is believed to have suffered and the threat posed by unexploded bombs mean residents of the city itself could take longer to return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Tikrit holds both strategic and symbolic importance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It was the hometown of executed dictator Saddam Hussein, remnants of whose Baath party collaborated with ISIS last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Since June, Iraqi forces had tried and failed several times to retake the city, seen as a key stepping stone to recapturing Mosul, the jihadists' largest hub in Iraq.</td></tr>
