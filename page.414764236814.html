<h3>Rangers 5, Coyotes 1: In Alain Vigneault?s 500th Win, Rangers Rout the Coyotes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- Rick Nash scored his N.H.L.-best 35th goal early in a four-goal third period, and the Rangers beat the Arizona Coyotes, 5-1, on Saturday night to give Coach Alain Vigneault his 500th career win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cam Talbot made 34 saves, including one on Tobias Rieder's third-period penalty shot, as the Rangers won their third straight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I feel very privileged and fortunate to have all those good players through the years," said Vigneault, who became the 21st coach in the league to reach 500 wins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Chris Kreider, Marc Staal and Lee Stempniak also scored for the Rangers, and Kevin Hayes added a short-handed goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Antoine Vermette scored for the Coyotes, while Mike Smith made 28 saves in Arizona's seventh straight home loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nash sent a shot from the right circle off the crossbar 1 minute 19 seconds into the final period to make it 2-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It was Nash's seventh goal in eight games as he moved closer to his career high of 40 goals with Columbus in 2008-9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Talbot, who made his sixth straight start for the injured Henrik Lundqvist, was tested just a few minutes later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Dominic Moore hauled down Rieder, setting up Arizona's second penalty shot in a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Both failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Talbot gobbled up Rieder's backhand attempt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Cam's been the backbone of our team," Nash said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Added Vigneault: "He's been waiting for an opportunity to prove he can play on a consistent level."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Rangers soon unleashed the potent offense that has been key to their 6-1-1 stretch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Hayes soon scored the Rangers' eighth short-handed goal of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Staal's goal with 5:44 left and Stempniak's tally with 2:13 left gave the Rangers 33 goals in nine games.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>An Associated Press article in some copies on Feb. 15 about the Rangers' 5-1 victory over the Arizona Coyotes misstated Rick Nash's career high for goals and the season he achieved it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>His career high is 41 goals in 2003-4 - not 40 goals in 2008-9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on February 15, 2015, on page SP4 of the New York edition with the headline: In Vigneault's 500th Win, Rangers Rout the Coyotes.</td></tr>
