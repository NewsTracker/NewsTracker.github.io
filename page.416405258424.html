<h3>Egypt's Morsi jailed for 20 years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An Egyptian court has sentenced ousted President Mohammed Morsi to 20 years in jail for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters during his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It is the first verdict he has received since his overthrow and is one of several trials he faces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Morsi was deposed by the military in July 2013 following mass street protests against his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Since then, the authorities have banned his Muslim Brotherhood movement and arrested thousands of his supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Morsi and 14 other Brotherhood figures escaped a more serious charge of inciting the killing of protesters, which could have carried the death sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Most of the other defendants were also given 20-year prison sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Morsi's legal team have said they will appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This verdict is just one of several Mr Morsi faces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>What's become of Egypt's Morsi?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Morsi stood accused of inciting supporters to kill a journalist and opposition protesters in clashes outside the presidential palace in late 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As crowds grew outside the palace, Morsi ordered the police to disperse them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They refused, so the Muslim Brotherhood brought in their own supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Eleven people died in the ensuing clashes, mostly from the Brotherhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hearing the verdict, Morsi and the other defendants gave a four-fingered salute, a symbol of the deadly clearance of Brotherhood supporters at the Rabaah al-Adawiya mosque in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A senior Brotherhood figure, Amr Darrag, called the ruling a "travesty of justice".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They want to pass a life sentence for democracy in Egypt," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ramy Ghanem, a lawyer for one of those injured in the clashes, expressed surprise that Morsi escaped the more serious charge, but told the AFP news agency the sentences are "not bad".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>However the brother of one of the victims said he wanted to "enter the cage and pull out his [Morsi's] intestines", according to Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Morsi has rejected the authority of the courts, shouting during his first trial that he was the victim of a military coup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Monday, a court sentenced 22 Muslim Brotherhood supporters to death for an attack on a police station in Cairo, part of an ongoing crackdown against the Islamist movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Morsi was Egypt's first freely-elected president, but protests began building less than a year into his rule when he issued a decree granting himself far-reaching powers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A court dropped charges of conspiracy to kill protesters against Morsi's predecessor, Hosni Mubarak, last year.</td></tr>
