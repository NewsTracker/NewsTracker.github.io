<h3>An Android robot is peeing on an Apple logo in Google Maps</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At least, that's what shows up if you look up Rawalpindi in Google Maps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It's not clear how long the image has been there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When you look at "satellite view," you'll see a few residential roads, a bit of green space and some hills -- nothing that looks remotely like an Android peeing on an apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was discovered Friday by Ahmad Babar, a former Samsung employee living in Lahore, Pakistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Facebook (FB, Tech30), Babar posted that he came across the Android image while looking for a place in Rawalpindi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google said the image was not created by an employee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The company has a group of vetted contributors who add to the Maps tool in order to keep Google Maps up to date, and one of those contributors drew the image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The vast majority of users who edit our maps provide great contributions, such as mapping places that have never been mapped before," said Caroline Matthews, a spokeswoman for Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We're sorry for this inappropriate user-created content; we're working to remove it quickly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google (GOOGL, Tech30) is no stranger to so-called Easter eggs -- hidden treasures in its products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Just try typing "tilt," "do a barrel roll," "recursion," "anagram," "once in a blue moon," or "answer to life the universe and everything" into Google's search engine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In Google Images, type "Atari breakout."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Google Translate has Pirate, Elmer Fudd, Klingon and Pig Latin options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There are literally dozens of Google Maps Easter eggs in addition to the Android peeing on an Apple (AAPL, Tech30) logo, including a tie-dyed Street View character in Berkeley, California and a "royal carriage" transportation option when asking for directions to Windsor Castle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A spokeswoman for Apple did not respond to requests for comment.</td></tr>
