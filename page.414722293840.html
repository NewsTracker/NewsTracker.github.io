<h3>Girl who escaped Boko Haram reveals Chibok kidnapping inspired them</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When Islamic extremists snatched more than 270 girls from the Chibok boarding school in Nigeria in the dead of night, protests broke out worldwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The U.S. pledged to help find them, and the #BringBackOurGirls hashtag was born.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some 10 months later, most are still missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Boko Haram extremist group sees the mass kidnapping as a shining symbol of success, and has abducted hundreds of other girls, boys and women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The militants brag to their new captives about the surrender of the Chibok girls, their conversion to Islam and their marriage to fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'They told me the Chibok girls have a new life where they learn to fight,' says Abigail John, 15, who was held by Boko Haram for more than four weeks before escaping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dorcas Aiden, 20, was living at home when the war came to her village.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The kidnappings reflect the growing ambition and brazenness of Boko Haram, which seeks to impose an Islamic state across Nigeria, Africa's most populous country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some 10,000 people have died in the Islamic uprising over the past year, compared to 2,000 in the previous four years, according to the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'It's devastating,' said Bukky Shonibare, an activist in Abuja, of the kidnappings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>John was among three girls interviewed by The Associated Press who recently escaped from Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While their stories could not be independently verified, they were strikingly similar, and all spoke of their captors' obsession with the Chibok girls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The girls had no idea whether the militants were telling the truth or making up stories to taunt their victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>John says the fighters enjoyed relating how they had whipped and slapped the Chibok girls until they submitted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>When the Nigerian air force dropped a bomb on the house where John was confined, she tried to escape, she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She wrestled with the fighters, but they broke her am and hauled her off to another house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>At the end of last year, the Nigerian army liberated the town where she was held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She is now in Yola with her father, sister and six brothers, in a house overcrowded with refugees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She finally was able to get medical attention for her fractured right arm, which remains in a cast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>John, 15, was held by Boko Haram for more than four weeks before escaping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The kidnappings of the Chibok girls in April brought Boko Haram to the world's attention in a way the group could not have imagined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls was tweeted more than 480,000 times globally in early May, and U.S. first lady Michelle Obama held it up in a sign to television cameras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>On Wednesday, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan again promised the girls will be brought home alive, saying he is 'more hopeful' about their fate now that a multinational force is being formed to fight Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>'Give us some time over the Chibok girls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The story will be better in a few weeks,' Jonathan promised, as he has many times in the past, on a nationally televised program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In the 10 months since the mass kidnapping, Boko Haram has increased the tempo and ferocity of its insurgency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In August, it began seizing and holding towns, and - copying the Islamic State group - declared it would recreate an ancient Islamic caliphate in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The fighting has since spilled across Nigeria's borders, and the African Union this month authorized a multinational force of 8,750 troops to try to stamp it out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Dorcas Aiden, 20, was another of those caught in Boko Haram's siege.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>She had finished high school and was living at home when the war came to her village.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Fighters took her to a house in the town of Gulak and held her captive for two weeks last September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The more than 50 teenage girls crammed into the house were beaten if they refused to study Quranic verses or conduct daily Muslim prayers, she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>When the fighters got angry, they shot their guns in the air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Aiden finally gave in and denied her Christian faith to become Muslim, at least in name, she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>One day, the fighters stormed into the room where she was kept locked up with a dozen other girls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>They showed a video of the Chibok girls, dressed in hijabs, with only their faces visible through their veils.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Aiden says she was so overwhelmed that she cried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The fighters said the Chibok girls were all Muslims now, and some were training as fighters to fight women, which Boko Haram men are not supposed to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Aiden's captors boasted about how they had married off the Chibok girls, she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>One fighter said he would marry her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>She balked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>'I said, 'No, I will not marry you,'' Aiden recounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Aiden says the insurgents threatened to break the legs of any girl who tried to escape, but she and six others ran anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>As she made her way through abandoned farm fields, she noticed that Boko Haram had filled about 10 other houses with kidnapped girls and women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Aiden, who is now in Yola with tens of thousands of other refugees, dreams of going to university, in defiance of the extremists' insistence that girls should be married, not educated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Another escapee, a shy 16-year-old captured in September, begs that her name not be published because she escaped only a few weeks ago and believes the fighters are actively searching for her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>After the girl's village was attacked four times, she fled to a great-aunt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Then that village also was targeted, she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>The fighters held her for four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>When she escaped, she walked through the bush and across the border into Cameroon to avoid areas under Boko Haram's control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>She is now taking refuge in a Catholic church in Yola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>All the girls say they were not raped, despite the fears of some villagers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Instead, the fighters said they wanted the girls to remain virgins until they were married off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>'They said they are doing the work of God, so they will not touch us,' the 16-year-old recounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>As she tells her story, she fidgets and looks down at her hands, clasped in her lap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>She recounts how one fighter, nicknamed 'Tall Arab,' was set on marrying her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The man told her the Chibok girls were 'enjoying their matrimonial homes,' she remembers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>He also said the Chibok girls had turned against their parents, and were 'ready to slit their parents' throats' if they ever saw them again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Some never will.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Even if the girls are released, people in Chibok say at least 13 of their parents have died since they were seized, in Boko Haram violence or possibly stress-related illness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>While dozens of Chibok girls escaped on their own after their kidnapping, 219 are still missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Nigeria's military initially feared any action could lead to the girls being killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>But villagers reported last week that air force jets have begun bombing the Sambisa Forest - the area where fighters told Aiden some girls still are held captive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Meanwhile, suspected Boko Haram militants attacked a village on the shore of Lake Chad early Friday, marking the first such violence against the neighbor contributing the most military might to the regional fight against the Nigeria-based terror group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>The assault took place in the village of Ngouboua, according to army Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Azem Bermandoa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>It was not immediately known how many civilians were killed during the attack, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>'The assailants have scattered and the army is now pursuing them,' Bermandoa told The Associated Press by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Boko Haram has expanded its attacks against neighboring countries over the past week following threats to punish any nations contributing to the fight against the terror group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Chad, Niger, Cameroon and Benin all have pledged to send military support though Chadian soldiers are already fighting Boko Haram militants inside Cameroon and Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>The multinational force to fight Boko Haram is expected to be formally launched in the coming weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Ngouboua is already home to nearly 3,300 refugees who had fled the Boko Haram-related violence back home in Nigeria, according to the United Nations.</td></tr>
