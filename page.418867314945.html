<h3>Microsoft is counting on Windows 10 to undo woes from Windows 8 and prove PC still has a role</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO - Microsoft's new Windows 10 operating system debuts Wednesday, as the longtime leader in PC software struggles to carve out a new role in a world where people increasingly rely on smartphones, tablets and information stored online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>No one's expected to line up overnight for Windows 10, the way people did 20 years ago for Windows 95.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Microsoft is counting on tens or even hundreds of millions of people to download its latest release for free in the coming months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The launch will be accompanied by a global marketing campaign for an event the company hopes will be pivotal - both for its own future and for a vast audience of computer users around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Windows 10 is coming to PCs and tablets first, but it's also designed to run phones, game consoles and even holographic headsets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It has new features, a streamlined Web browser called Edge and a desktop version of Cortana, the online assistant that is Microsoft's answer to Google Now and Apple's Siri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Still, the company insists Windows 10 will seem familiar to users of Windows 7, the six-year-old operating system still running on most PCs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Microsoft and PC makers want to erase the memory of the last big update, 2012's Windows 8, which alienated many with its jarring, unwieldy design.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Microsoft skipped the name Windows 9, as if to distance itself further from the last release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While many analysts believe Windows 8 made sagging PC sales even worse, it's unclear if Windows 10 will spur the industry back to growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A: Microsoft plans promotional events in several cities Wednesday, tied to a global ad campaign and a series of charitable donations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>About 5 million people who enrolled in an earlier test program will be able to download Windows 10 right away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The company is also offering Windows 10 as a free download, any time over the next year, to anyone who has the Home or Pro versions of Windows 7 or 8 (but not the Enterprise versions used by big organizations).</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Some may not get it the first day; Microsoft says it will deliver downloads in waves, to ensure things go smoothly, but it hasn't said how long that will take.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Details on how to upgrade are here: http://bit.ly/1eNCySl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Retailers such as Best Buy, Staples and Wal-Mart will have some desktops and laptops with Windows 10 already installed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>More models are coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Q: Why is Microsoft giving Windows 10 for free?</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A: The company wants to get the new software on as many devices as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Microsoft needs a large pool of users to convince independent programmers that it's worth their time to build useful or entertaining apps for Windows 10 devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Executives also believe that if people are exposed to the latest and best Windows, they're more likely to try other Microsoft products on PCs and mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>CEO Satya Nadella says he wants to have 1 billion devices running Windows 10 in three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Microsoft estimates there are 1.5 billion people who currently use some kind of Windows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Rather than charging them to upgrade, as Microsoft used to do, it's embracing the free download model pioneered by Apple and Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Q: How will Microsoft make money?</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A: Microsoft will still collect licensing fees from PC makers that install Windows 10 on new machines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In recent years, most consumers have waited until they bought a new computer to get the latest Windows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Microsoft also makes money from selling Windows and other software to large businesses and organizations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In addition, Microsoft is counting on Windows 10 to spur more use of other services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Microsoft makes money from selling advertising for its Bing search engine, and Windows 10 comes with many apps that steer people to Bing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The company also collects fees from people who use premium versions of its Office software, OneDrive cloud storage and Skype.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Q: Why does this matter to consumers?</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>A: Microsoft says Windows 10 is designed for the way people use computers today - with a faster Web browser and features that make it easier to start tasks on a PC and then switch to a hand-held device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>(Apple and Google tout similar features in their software.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Windows 10 also lets users log in with their face, iris or thumbprint, instead of remembering passwords, though this works only with computers equipped with the right hardware.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Most PC users are still working with Windows 7, thanks to Windows 8's unpopularity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>But Microsoft plans to phase out maintenance and security support for Windows 7 over the next five years, and for Windows 8 by 2023, as it did with the older Windows XP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Still, there's no need to panic about upgrading right away.</td></tr>
