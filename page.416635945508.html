<h3>Russian Lawmaker Sees Apple's U2 Album as Gay 'Propaganda'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A member of Russia's parliament has asked prosecutors to determine whether Apple violated Russia's ban on gay "propaganda" when it delivered U2's latest album to a half-billion iTunes users for free last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Izvestia, a newspaper loyal to the Kremlin, reported Wednesday that it has a copy of Alexander Starovoitov's appeal to prosecutors in which he says the cover of the album "Songs of Innocence" shows two men "in a display of non-traditional sexual relations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In fact, the cover shows the band's drummer embracing his 18-year-old son, both of them shirtless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It is not yet clear whether prosecutors will open an investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some of those in Russia who ridiculed Starovoitov's appeal drew a comparison to the time in 2006 when President Vladimir Putin kissed a small boy's bare stomach.</td></tr>
