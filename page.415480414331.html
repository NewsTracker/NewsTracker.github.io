<h3>Pakistan church attacks kill 14, spark deadly riots</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The bombings occurred during prayers at two churches located around half a kilometer apart in the city's Youhanabad neighborhood, which is home to more than 100,000 Christians, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Up to 4,000 then took to the streets of the eastern city, many armed with clubs, smashing vehicles and attacking a city bus station in a rare show of anger by the beleaguered minority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Doctor Mohammad Saeed Sohbin, medical superintendent of the General Hospital, told AFP: "We have received 14 dead bodies and 70 injured," adding that the figure did not include the suspected militants who were lynched or the bombers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Zahid Pervez, the top health official in Lahore, confirmed the death toll and told reporters that 78 people were wounded in both attacks, which left blood and shoes scattered across the blast sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sunday's attack is the worst in over a year against Pakistan's Christians, who make up a tiny proportion of the mainly Muslim country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Eyewitness Jacob David said people jumped out of the church window to save their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"These were huge blasts, one after another. Everyone started running here and there, some people jumped outside after breaking the window," the 55-year-old told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Police spokeswoman Nabila Ghazanfar said two policemen guarding the churches were among those killed in the attacks, while two people were beaten to death by protesters who took to the streets after the blasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Policemen on duty at both the entrances tried to stop them but the bombers blew themselves up," she told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The angry mob protesting after the blast beat to death two people whom they suspected of being associates of the attackers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An AFP photographer saw the bodies of the two suspected militants on fire after the beatings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It was not clear whether they were still alive at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Pakistani Taliban's Jamaat-ul-Ahrar faction described the blasts as suicide attacks and vowed to continue their campaign for the enforcement of Sharia Islamic law, in a statement emailed to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Christians, who make up around 2 percent of Pakistan's population of 180 million, have been targeted by attacks and riots in recent years, often over allegations of profanity regarding the Quran or the Prophet Mohammed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Sunday's attacks were the worst on the community since a devastating double suicide-bombing in the northwestern city of Peshawar in September 2013 killed 82 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That came months after more than 3,000 Muslim protesters torched some 100 houses as they rampaged through Joseph Colony, another Christian neighbourhood of Lahore, following blasphemy allegations against a Christian man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Pope Francis on Sunday condemned the attacks and accused the world of "seeking to hide" the persecution of Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's with pain, much pain, that I was told of the terrorist attacks against two Christian churches in Lahore in Pakistan, which have caused numerous deaths and injuries," the pope said after his weekly Angelus prayer in Rome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The thousands of Christian protesters who clashed with police on Sunday attacked their cars with stones and sticks, as women wept and beat their heads and chests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The protesters, some wearing crosses round their necks, later turned on the city's bus rapid transit system - a signature project of the ruling PML-N party of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Sharif in a statement condemned the church bombings and "directed provincial governments to ensure the security of [the] public and their properties."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Zaeem Qadri, a spokesman for the provincial government, said efforts were being made to stop the rioting but "emotions are very high because their churches have been attacked."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Christians also took to the streets in other cities, including Pakistan's largest city Karachi, where around 200 protesters blocked a main road and burnt tyres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>There were also demonstrations in Peshawar in the northwest, in the central city of Multan and in Quetta in the southwest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Sunday's attack was the first by the Taliban since three of their major factions said on Thursday they had reunited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Pakistan's military has stepped up its fight against militants since Taliban gunmen massacred more than 150 people, most of them children, at a school in Peshawar in December.</td></tr>

<h3>UK arrests 3 teens stopped in Turkey on way to Syria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The three suspects were being questioned at a central London police station after their alleged bid to get to Syria, coming soon after three British schoolgirls managed to elude authorities and get to Syria last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The girls are believed by police to have joined Islamic State militants in their self-declared caliphate in parts of Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>British police said the three males, two 17-year-old boys and a 19-year-old man, have been arrested on suspicion of planning terrorist acts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They haven't been charged and their names haven't been released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When the schoolgirls managed to slip into Syria despite a search by both Turkish and British authorities, there was finger-pointing on both sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Things were quite different Sunday, as Turkey and Britain hailed the fruits of their cooperation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The male trio left Britain several days ago, traveling to Spain and then flying from Barcelona to Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They were detained in Istanbul Friday after British officials notified Turkish authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>British legislator Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the case shows that the number of young Britons trying to reach the conflict zone in Syria "is on a much larger scale" than had been thought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Vaz praised Turkish authorities for acting quickly to prevent the teens from entering Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Police counterterrorism officials and security services personnel have said their resources have been badly stretched as they try to maintain surveillance on the growing number of individuals interested in joining the extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They have warned that some who return after spending time in the conflict zone plan to launch attacks inside Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A senior Turkish government official, who can't be named because of Turkish rules that bar civil servants from speaking to journalists without prior authorization, said the two 17-year-old boys had been detained at Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen airport Friday by Turkish authorities who were acting on intelligence provided by British officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The teenagers were planning to travel to Syria, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Turkish authorities believe they wanted to join IS extremists, but the official cautioned that they weren't "100 percent" certain that was their aim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The 19-year-old man was detained at the airport after questioning by police based on profiling at the airport, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>British police originally believed only two teens were traveling, but soon learned that a third was involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They were deported to London on Saturday - instead of Spain as is the normal procedure in Turkey - because Britain insisted that they be returned to Britain, the Turkish official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Turkish official described the incident as a "'joint Turkish-British operation," and said Turkey welcomed the timely intelligence provided by Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Turkey is doing all that it can to stop the passage into Syria, but there has to be cooperation," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This operation shows what can be achieved when there is cooperation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Turkey's strategic position as a convenient link between Western Europe and Syria has meant that an increasing number of Britons have traveled there to use it as a jumping off point to enter Syria and link up with IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>British police say roughly 700 Britons have traveled to Syria to join extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Recent cases indicate a growing number of young women are traveling there to become "jihadi brides."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Authorities say Internet-based social media have made it much easier for young Britons to communicate with extremists inside Syria and that many are also drawn by websites touting the attraction of living under Islamic law.</td></tr>
