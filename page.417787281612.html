<h3>Investors Rattled by Greek Bailout Impasse</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Investors in Greece have been rattled by the failure over the weekend to break a months-long deadlock in the country's bailout talks with creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Shares on the Athens Stock Exchange were 6 percent lower in early trading on Monday, and markets opened lower across Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The talks in Brussels between negotiators from Greece and its bailout lenders failed to bridge differences despite mounting pressure on Athens, which has taken the emergency measure of bundling its June repayments to the International Monetary Fund until the end of the month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Monday told the Efimerida Ton Syntakton newspaper that eurozone and IMF lenders had demanded a new round of pension cuts, which his government had rejected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>French President Francois Hollande warned of the risk of "turbulence" in Europe if no deal is reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He urged Greece to resume negotiations as soon as possible with bailout lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Greece must not wait... there's not a moment to lose," he said Monday during a visit to the Paris Air Show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hollande said he would "probably" have the opportunity to speak soon with both Tsipras and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</td></tr>
