<h3>Kenya: Extremist slain in attack on army could be British</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - Kenyan authorities say they are trying to establish whether one of the bodies of two white men, among the suspected extremists killed in an attempted attack on an army camp in Lamu County over the weekend, is that of Briton Thomas Evans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Military spokesman Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>David Obonyo says photos of Evans, also known as Abdul Akim, seem to match with the body but only DNA and biometric tests can determine his identity conclusively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In a firefight, the Kenyan army Sunday killed 11 militants who attacked the camp - including two apparent foreigners - from the Somali extremist group al-Shabab and suffered two fatal casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Al-Shabab militants say they are carrying out attacks in Kenya because it is deployed troops to Somalia to fight the militants.</td></tr>
