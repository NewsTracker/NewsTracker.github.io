<h3>Tunisia terrorist attack will cost TUI up to Â£32m, says Thomson and First Choice owner</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Thomson and First Choice owner TUI has said the terrorist massacre in Tunisia will have an impact on earnings of up to 32 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The attack in June claimed the lives of 38 holidaymakers including 30 UK nationals, who were TUI customers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Two other tourists with the company from Germany and one from Belgium also died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Most of those injured were also its customers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tourists were flown home from the North African country and the travel operator has cancelled holidays there, with the UK Foreign Office and other governments still advising against visits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The cost of the flights home was 10 million euros ( 7 million) while the impact of empty hotels in a region that normally accounts for just under half a million TUI visitors a year is expected at 25 to 30 million euros ( 18 million to 21 million).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Together with other costs, the total impact is seen at 35 to 45 million euros ( 25 million to 32 million), a spokeswoman for the company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tunisia has in the past represented 3% of the company's annual tour operator programmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>TUI set out details of the impact in a trading update for the third quarter to the end of June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Joint chief executives Friedrich Joussen and Peter Long said: "This quarter was marked by the tragic events in Tunisia at the end of June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Supporting our customers, their families and our colleagues through this sad time remains our highest priority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We are very proud of the commitment and dedication our colleagues have shown throughout this unprecedented situation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Long described the attack as a "human tragedy that completely overshadowed our quarter".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He said it was "the most horrific event I and my company have ever had to deal with".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>TUI also said that bookings to Greece in late June and the first half of July were hit by economic uncertainty in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But Mr Long said that overall there had been no impact as after a slowdown in bookings there had been a recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The figures come after rival Thomas Cook revealed a 25 million hit to earnings from events in Tunisia and Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Long said that after the Tunisia attack, 18 additional flights were laid on to bring holidaymakers home, including 13 from the UK, four from Belgium and one from the Netherlands.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Long said: "Our priority has been to support our customers, their families and colleagues impacted by this horrendous event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Both I and all my colleagues still remain in deep shock as a result of the tragic loss of life and injuries to our customers."</td></tr>
