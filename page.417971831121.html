<h3>Maradona's road to FIFA presidency filled with obstacles</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this May 4, 2015 file photo, Argentina football legend Diego Maradona speaks on the second day of the SoccerEx Asian Forum conference in Southern Shuneh, Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Journalist Victor Hugo Morales said on Twitter late Sunday, June 21, 2015 that Maradona plans to run for president of FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>If Diego Maradona is serious about running for the FIFA presidency, he still has a lot of work to do just to get on the ballot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The former Argentina soccer star with a history of on- and-off-the field controversy would need to pass an integrity check and persuade five of FIFA's member associations to nominate him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Maradona's desire to run for FIFA's top job was reported by Victor Hugo Morales, a journalist close to the retired great.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Morales, who hosts a show on the regional network Telesur, said on Twitter that Maradona told him he plans to be candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>FIFA President Sepp Blatter announced this month that he would be stepping down - four days after being elected for a fifth term - amid a U.S. probe into $150 million in bribes allegedly paid to top soccer officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro immediately called for Maradona to replace him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Maradona has been a high-profile supporter of Venezuela's socialist government and a sharp critic of corruption in soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Maradona's long list of provocative incidents would seem to go against the image that soccer's world governing body will want to embrace as it digs out from its worst scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>- Maradona has run into tax problems in Italy, where he has debts totaling tens of millions of dollars accruing from his 1984-91 stint playing with Napoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>- He was accused of cheating when he punched in the "Hand of God" goal against England at the 1986 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>- In 1994, Maradona fired an air gun at reporters and was given a two-year suspended sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Last year, he slapped a journalist in the face and called him an "idiot" outside a theater in Buenos Aires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>- Maradona was constantly criticized when he coached Argentina's national team at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and was fired after Argentina was beaten 4-0 by Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>- His tumultuous personal life has often been a target for local media in Argentina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In the often mysterious world of FIFA politics, it is far from clear which five of the 209 member federations would choose to nominate Maradona and why they would do it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Cuba is perhaps one country which could back him, having welcomed Maradona as a regular visitor to his friend Fidel Castro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Venezuela is another ally because of Maduro's vocal support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It is difficult to see Maradona's native Argentina nominating him, given the dire state of relations that existed between him and long-time federation president Julio Grondona, who died last July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Grondona's allies and entourage still have influence and a request to support Maradona's nomination would likely be seen as an insult to the former strongman of Argentine football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Maradona also appeared to wear out his welcome in the United Arab Emirates, the only country where he coached since coaching Argentina at the 2010 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Many football officials worldwide who still support Blatter will not have forgotten Maradona's language toward the now-outgoing FIFA president during his recent re-election campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I think we have a good chance to kick (Sepp) Blatter in the rear end - without a doubt," Maradona said in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Even if Maradona secured the required backers, his problems to get on the ballot paper would only just be starting after the nomination deadline passed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>FIFA election rules require mandatory integrity checks for presidential hopefuls within 10 days before they are officially accepted as candidates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The checks are overseen by FIFA's election monitor - audit and compliance committee chairman Domenico Scala - and performed by the investigation chamber of the governing body's ethics committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>That panel is chaired by Swiss former state prosecutor Cornel Borbely, who succeeded his former boss Michael Garcia last December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Scala could also rule on whether Maradona fulfils the basic election requirement of holding official positions in football for at least two of the five years previous to election day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Maradona's coaching spell with UAE club lasted just over a year in 2011-12.</td></tr>
