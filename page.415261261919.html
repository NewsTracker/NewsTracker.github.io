<h3>Ford plane hit tree before landing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 72-year-old was flying a 1942 Ryan Aeronautical ST3KR when he reported a loss of engine power and attempted to return to the airport he had taken off from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The actor, who is best known for his starring roles in the Star Wars movies and Indiana Jones franchise, was reportedly left bloodied with a large cut on his head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Patrick Jones, an air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, said Ford picked "the best spot" to make a safe landing after running into difficulty following take-off from Santa Monica airport and attempting to return to the runway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He added: "The airplane clipped a tree and came to rest on the golf course. The investigation is ongoing. We are going to finish documenting the accident site and recover the airplane to a local hangar for further investigation, it will be examined and the records of the aircraft will be examined and we will submit a factual report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The process will take a couple of weeks to a month and the final report probably won't be out for a year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Asked by reporters about the skill involved in landing a plane under those conditions, Jones said: "When you take off from an airport and you need to land an aircraft you have to pick the best spots that there are and this was the best spot at this point."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He added: "Any time that a human being can survive an accident involving an airplane it's a good day, it is really hard to walk into an accident and not jump to conclusions, conclusions get you in trouble."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ford was the only occupant of the single engine plane when it crashed on the nine-hole Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California at 2.30pm (10.30pm GMT) on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Patrick Butler of the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) - who would not officially identify Ford due to privacy restrictions - said he suffered moderate injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Speaking from the scene of the crash, he said: "He suffered basically some moderate trauma and he was alert and conscious and paramedics from LAFD transported the patient to the local area hospital."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Jones said he believed the plane Ford was piloting was the subject of an award winning restoration, adding: "It's a reciprocal engine, it has a lot of different systems but this is a fairly simple aircraft, it's a 1942 vintage aircraft and there's not a lot of computers to it so a lot of it is old school mechanics."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Officials from the NTSB and LAFD removed the yellow wings of the small plane before it was winched up on a crane and transferred to a truck to be taken to a nearby hangar for further investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Firefighters stood close by with hoses as the small plane was transferred from the crane to the flatbed of a lorry and driven from the golf course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A witness yesterday reportedly told TMZ: "I was one of the first people to run from the hole toward the plane. Four to five men pulled the pilot out of the plane. They got him away from the plane. They were concerned it would catch on fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Two doctors were there - and they had a first aid box with them. He was conscious, talking a little - a huge cut on his head. A swathe of his skin was missing. There was blood dripping down his face."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The actor's son Ben said his father is "incredibly strong" and thanked the public for their good wishes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"At the hospital. Dad is ok. Battered, but ok! He is every bit the man you would think he is. He is an incredibly strong man," he wrote on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Thank you all for your thoughts and good vibes for my dad."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr Jones said: "We're going to look at everything: weather, man, the machine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In a recording on the website LiveATC.net, a man - believed to be Ford - is heard to say "engine failure, immediate return".</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Video footage also emerged of paramedics treating the actor at the scene of the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The actor has been in the wars of late and broke his leg in June last year while filming JJ Abrams's Star Wars Episode VII at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Ford, who is married to actress Calista Flockhart, got his pilot's licence in the 1990s and has made headlines with his flying before - although he had never been significantly injured doing it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He has been involved in several rescues and a plane he was piloting was blown off a runway in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 2000.</td></tr>

<h3>CIA director announces overhaul of spy agency</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Brennan announced the restructuring to the CIA workforce on Friday, including a new directorate devoted to boosting the CIA's computer hacking skills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said the move comes after nine outside experts spent three months analyzing the agency's management structure, including what deputy CIA director David Cohen called "pain points," organizational areas where the CIA's bureaucracy does not work efficiently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Briefing reporters with Cohen at CIA headquarters this week, Brennan said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the CIA is not covering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He lamented that there is often no single person he can hold accountable for the spying mission in any given part of the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There are a lot of areas that I would like to have better insight to, better information about, better access to," Brennan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Safe havens, denied areas. Whether because we don't even have a diplomatic presence in a country, or because there are parts of countries that have been overrun and taken over by terrorist groups and others."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The changes come against a backdrop of evidence that the CIA's focus on hunting and killing terrorists since the Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>11 attacks has led to an erosion of the espionage and analytic capabilities the agency built during the Cold War.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The CIA, along with other U.S. intelligence agencies, wrongly assessed the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2002 and failed to anticipate the rapid collapse of Middle East governments during the Arab Spring in 2011, among other shortcomings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The agency's greatest public success of recent years - the 10-year effort to locate and kill Osama bin Laden in 2011 - may have taken longer than it should have, according to evidence made public in the recent Senate report on CIA interrogations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Internal CIA surveys have cited bad management and bureaucratic frustration as factors in driving talent away from the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Under Brennan's reorganization, the CIA would break down the wall between the operations and analytical arms, a system that typically has required the case officers who recruit spies and run covert operations to work for different bosses, in different offices, than analysts who interpret the intelligence and write briefing papers for the president and other policymakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The new plan would blend practitioners of those separate disciplines into 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There are a handful of such centers at the moment, including the Counter Terrorism Center, where analysts and operators have worked side by side for the last decade targeting al-Qaida with espionage and drone strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Under the new plan, each center would be run by an assistant director who would be responsible for the entire intelligence mission within that jurisdiction, including covert operations, spying, analysis, liaison with foreign partners and logistics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The system of CIA stations, headed by a CIA station chief, will remain in place, Brennan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Most stations are in U.S. embassies, and various CIA case officers in embassies may be working on different missions for different centers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The changes do not require congressional approval and will be undertaken within the CIA's current budget, CIA officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Critics of a blended approach have raised concerns that combining analysts with operators could compromise the objectivity of the analysts, who are tasked with coldly interpreting intelligence in which they have no stake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It may be harder for an analyst to cast doubt on a source recruited by a case officer he knows personally, the theory goes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The head of the CIA's operation arm retired abruptly in January after voicing concerns about the plan, say two former CIA officials who know him but spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss internal agency matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Brennan said the undercover officer's decision "was not a result of this," but he did not dispute that the officer had opposed some of the changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Any time we've put analysts and operators together, the result has been a more powerful product," said John McLaughlin, a former CIA analyst who became acting director, and who advised Brennan on the restructuring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Brennan is retaining the old structure of CIA directorates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But he is changing some names, including restoring the old moniker "Directorate of Operations," to the spying arm, the name it had before being rebadged the National Clandestine Service in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>For analysts, what used to be called the Directorate of Intelligence will be renamed the Directorate of Analysis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Two others, the directorates of support and science and technology, remain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The directorates will manage human resources and set tradecraft standards, Brennan said, while the centers carry out the intelligence missions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In another evolution, Brennan is creating a fifth directorate, the Directorate of Digital Innovation, which will focus on the new world of computer networks that has changed the way espionage is conducted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Brennan avoided the term "cyber," a word used by the National Security Agency, the country's premier digital spying service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The CIA's mission of human spying now almost always has a digital component -even something so simple as backgrounding a potential asset by hacking into databases - and Brennan said the agency needs to intensify its focus on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The CIA will also significantly boost its leadership training and talent development efforts, which have been compared unfavorably to the military, Brennan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The reorganization is already drawing fire from some quarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Paul Pillar, a former CIA analyst who famously dissented from the case for war in Iraq, expressed concern that the costs of the changes would outweigh the benefits.</td></tr>
