<h3>Legislators pass bill that had been nixed over Islamic law</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BOISE, Idaho (AP) - The Idaho Legislature approved federally mandated child support rules Monday, undoing a rejection that had jeopardized U.S. involvement in an international treaty and threatened to collapse the state's payment system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bill now goes to Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter, who has said he will sign it into law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Idaho's rejection last month - by one vote on the last day of the legislative session over fears it could subject the U.S. courts to rulings made elsewhere under Islamic law - threatened an international effort intended to make it easier for parents to receive funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>There are about 150,000 active international cases involving about $600 million annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The refusal also would have cut the state's access to $46 million in federal funds and payment-processing systems that include payroll deductions, both of which were tied to the legislation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Republican governor called a special session to address the issue and drafted a compromise measure nearly two weeks before lawmakers were due back in Boise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dozens of nations have ratified the treaty since negotiations concluded in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the U.S., that process involves state-by-state approval, and 28 have passed their compliance legislation, so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Several others have advanced proposals to the governor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Experts had declined to speculate on whether the U.S. could have found an alternate way to approve the deal if Idaho had refused to reconsider.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Critics focused Monday on the federal funding connected to the bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Katherine Frazier told lawmakers such a setup amounts to bribery and cited the Bible in her opposition, saying "fire shall devour the houses of bribes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Bob Neugebauer said the bill "is not about child support. It's about extortion by our federal government."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Health and Human Services officials have said federal child-support funding has always been linked to mandated legislation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They also have said concerns over Shariah law were baseless because language in the treaty allows states to reject rulings that don't uphold American-style standards of legal fairness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The amended legislation doesn't change the wording surrounding the child support compliance section.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Instead, it adds a new section that says the state can't enforce any orders incompatible with Idaho law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Four out of the nine lawmakers who originally opposed the bill changed their vote once the amendments had been added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The remaining five remained firm in their disapproval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Kathleen Sims, a Coeur d'Alene Republican, said the bill would allow foreign tribunals and quasi-courts to trump U.S. law and that she was proud to be one of the nine lawmakers who originally voted the legislation down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Supporters said that if Idaho hadn't reversed the rejection last month, it would have left families across the nation with a burdensome system that makes it difficult - sometimes impossible - for parents to collect money owed to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I pray that they're right. I hope history proves they're right because once you do this, you can't undo this," said House Majority Leader Mike Moyle, who voted against the legislation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Back in April, opponents -both legislators and the public- raised concerns that the bill would allow Shariah courts to trump U.S. laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But on Monday, the same passion for the bill's failure remained but focused mainly on the federal government's overreach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Senate Minority Caucus Chair Grant Burgoyne said the lack of anti-Islam rhetoric during testimony and from lawmakers showed that it wasn't a real threat to Idaho or to the bill.</td></tr>
