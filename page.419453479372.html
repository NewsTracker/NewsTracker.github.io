<h3>Macedonia blocks migrants on border with Greece</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Police vehicles drive to the border between Greece and Macedonia in the southern Macedonian town of Gevgelija, Thursday, Aug. 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Macedonian police stepped up the security at the border with Greece apparently trying to stem recent surge of migrants who are coming from Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>GEVGELIJA, Macedonia (AP) - Macedonia stepped up security on its border with Greece on Thursday, stranding thousands of migrants on a dusty field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The government proclaimed a state of emergency and said it is deploying troops as it tries to stem a surge of migrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Macedonian police spokesman Ivo Kotevski said both police and the army will control the 50-kilometer (30 mile) stretch of the border in order to stop a "massive" influx of migrants coming from Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This measure is being introduced for the security of (Macedonian) citizens who live in the border areas and better treatment of the migrants," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The measure could create a huge backlog of migrants on the Greek side of the border, from which some 2,000 a day have been illegally crossing into Macedonia, an impoverished country overwhelmed by the surge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hundreds of migrants from the Greek island of Kos planned to move into Macedonia in the next few days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Until now, the border has been porous, with only a few patrols on each side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sealing it would disrupt the so-called Balkan corridor for migrants who start in Turkey and take boats to Greece or walk to Bulgaria, then make their way through Macedonia or Serbia en route to the wealthier countries of the European Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Almost 39,000 migrants, most of them Syrians, have been registered passing through Macedonia over the past month, double the number from the month before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Thousands of migrants were stranded Thursday in a no man's land near the Macedonian town of Gevgelija, from which they planned to catch trains that would take them to the Serbian border on their way to Hungary, which is building a fence to try to keep them out.</td></tr>
