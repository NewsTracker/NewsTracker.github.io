<h3>US finds racist, profit-driven practices in Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It won't be swift or simple, particularly if the same police chief is in charge and many of the same officers are on the beat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Some residents and civic leaders want to see wholesale changes in leadership or even complete dissolution of the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At the very least, experts said Thursday, Ferguson must move quickly, and publicly, to prove it is serious about regaining public trust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Justice Department on Wednesday cleared Darren Wilson, the white former Ferguson officer who shot Michael Brown, of federal civil rights charges in the death of the 18-year-old, who was black and unarmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But a separate report released simultaneously found patterns of racial profiling, bigotry and profit-driven law enforcement and court practices in the St. Louis County suburb that has come to represent the tension between minorities and American police nationwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Most of Ferguson's police officers and city leaders are white, but two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Meanwhile, attorneys for Brown's parents on Thursday announced plans for a wrongful-death lawsuit against the city and Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They did not say specifically when the complaint would be filed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Brown's parents attended the news conference announcing the case but did not speak or take questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Attorney Anthony Gray said the lawsuit will offer a "more accurate picture" of the fatal confrontation between Brown and the officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He had other options to him," Gray said of Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He chose deadly force as his option."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Gray called that choice "unreasonable and unnecessary."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Justice Department found that black drivers were more than twice as likely as others to be searched during routine traffic stops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Minority residents bear the burden of fines and court costs expected to generate $3 million this fiscal year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Black residents were more likely to face excessive force from police, often during unwarranted stops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Police Chief Tom Jackson, in a reply to a texted interview request, said only, "I'm still looking into this report."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Messages seeking comment from Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and attorneys for Wilson were not returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The report also included seven racially tinged emails that did not result in punishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Knowles said Wednesday that three employees were responsible for those emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>One was fired Wednesday, and the other two are on administrative leave pending an investigation, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The report spurred calls from some for St. Louis County or another municipality to take over the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Others urged Jackson to resign, or for the city to fire him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The chief has no credibility," said state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, a Democrat who represents Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"How in the world did the chief of police not know that there was an undercurrent of racism that existed in his police department?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Other political leaders were more measured in their assessment but still pressed for improvements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Facts exposed in the Department of Justice's report on the Ferguson Police Department are deeply disturbing and demonstrate the urgent need for the reforms I have called for, some of which the General Assembly is now considering, including reforms to municipal courts," Gov. Jay Nixon said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Criminology experts aren't sure change is possible without new leadership, but they agreed the city must move quickly in response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Every hour that goes by without them doing something solidifies in the minds of people in Ferguson and elsewhere that they either don't know what they're doing or that they're dismissive of the DOJ report," said Remy Cross, a criminology and sociology professor at Webster University in suburban St. Louis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Jens David Ohlin, law professor at the Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New York, said it is vital for Ferguson leaders to embrace the findings, rather than become defensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"The smartest thing for them to do is to commit themselves publicly to reforming their policing and judicial practices and tell the community and the rest of the country that they are grateful to the Justice Department, and they are going to make changes as quickly as possible," Ohlin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>At a brief news conference Wednesday, the mayor tried to show that Ferguson is serious about reform, saying the city has been working for some time to find more black officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Only four of the current 54 commissioned officers are black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Ferguson has also empaneled a civilian review board to consider complaints against officers and launched an "Explorer" program in a local school district, aiming to interest young people in law-enforcement careers, the mayor said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Back in September, the city council passed a law capping municipal court revenues at 15 percent of the overall budget and made changes to ease court cost and fee burdens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Those efforts weren't enough for the Rev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Al Sharpton, the chief eulogist at Brown's funeral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>He said Knowles' remarks were "mostly evasive, insignificant and showed a total failure to address the need for a change in leadership at the police department."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Associated Press Writer Jim Suhr in St. Louis contributed to this report.</td></tr>

<h3>Big men Kaminsky, Okafor lead way in top player race</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - It might be a two-man game when it comes to the race for player of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Frank Kaminsky is the savvy senior big man for No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>6 Wisconsin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jahlil Okafor is the freshman phenom center at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>3 Duke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Michigan State coach Tom Izzo has had to face both.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His early favorite: Kaminsky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I love Jahlil, I really do, but you have to talk about the versatility of a player. I recruited Jahlil for four years, and I love everything about him," Izzo said this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I wouldn't have even put them close when you look at Kaminsky a year ago."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Frank the Tank," as he is known to the Wisconsin student section, was pretty good last year in a breakout 2013-14 campaign that ended with a run to the Final Four.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"But Kaminsky is phenomenal right now. I just think he does it in so many different ways," Izzo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He's become a better passer, he's become a guy that just has a knack for drawing the defense, and he's a hard cover."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>If head-to-head matchups matter, Kaminsky had 17 points on 5 of 12 shooting to go with nine rebounds when Wisconsin played Duke in Madison in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Blue Devils won 80-70 after the team shot a blistering 65 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Okafor had 13 points on 6 of 8 shooting and added six boards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Lately, Okafor has been bothered by a sprained left ankle, though the freshman remains a force on the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Okafor had 30 points and nine rebounds in an overtime win over Virginia Tech last week, and followed it up 13 points and 14 boards in a victory over Syracuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Wednesday, though, in a 94-51 rout over Wake Forest, he finished with six - his first single-digit scoring game - after some early foul trouble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Another thing for a young kid - can you learn to play tired?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said after the Virginia Tech game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"He played through that. He wanted to win. You don't teach that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He could work on free throws, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Okafor is shooting 52 percent from the stripe, but 66 percent from the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He was averaging 18.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game going into Wednesday's game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Okafor has a fellow first-year running mate in guard Tyus Jones who was averaging 11.4 points and 5.7 assists per game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Another freshman, forward Justise Winslow, has scored at least 20 points in two of Duke's previous three games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Kaminsky is averaging 18.1 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 1.5 blocks per game going into Thursday's game at Minnesota.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He is also shooting 41 percent from 3-point range, tops among the Wisconsin regulars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>- Willie Cauley-Stein, Kentucky: 8.9 points on 59 percent shooting, 6.4 rebounds, 1.6 blocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The junior center anchors the defense on the undefeated team that is pretty much everyone's favorite to win the NCAA championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>- Justin Anderson, Virginia: 13.4 points, 48 percent 3-point shooting, 4.3 rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>A top defender and second-leading scorer on the one-loss team atop the ACC, the guard has missed the Cavaliers' last seven games with a broken finger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>- Jerian Grant, Notre Dame: 16.9 points, 6.6 assists, 1.8 steals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Coach Mike Brey has lauded Grant for his leadership this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>All the attention heaped on the star point guard opens up room for others on offense to operate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>- Delon Wright, Utah: 14.3 points, 5.3 assists, 4.6 rebounds, 2.2 steals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The senior guard paces an offense that puts an emphasis on sharing the ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>In a loss to Arizona last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Wright scored 17 points on 3 of 10 shooting, but went 10 of 12 from the foul line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>- D'Angelo Russell, Ohio State: 19.0 points, 5.3 assists, 1.6 steals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The guard was making headlines in his freshman year even before New York Knicks president Phil Jackson took notice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Jackson was fined for saying that Russell was a "great-looking kid" and "great prospect."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Russell could be a one-and-done departure from Columbus.</td></tr>
