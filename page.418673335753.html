<h3>U.K. PM offers five-year plan to defeat Islamic extremism</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON -- Prime Minister David Cameron is launching a five-year plan to defeat Islamic extremism, saying it's time to counter the ideology that has attracted so many young people to the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In what is being billed as his most important speech on the subject, Cameron says the extremist ideology of the group, also known as ISIL, must be countered so Britain becomes a more cohesive nation in which young Muslims feel they have a stake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some communities in Britain have little attachment to the country and that makes them vulnerable to radicalization, Cameron says, according to excerpts released by his office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He delivered a harsh warning to young people who might consider joining the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"You won't be some valued member of a movement. You are cannon fodder for them. They will use you," he will say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"If you are a boy, they will brainwash you, strap bombs to your body and blow you up. If you are a girl, they will enslave and abuse you. That is the sick and brutal reality of ISIL."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cameron is expected to announce a study designed to find ways to increase opportunities for young people from ethnic minorities and increase their integration in society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cameron also takes on the sensitive question of the role Britain's Muslim community should play in fighting Islamic State, saying extreme views such as believing in a "Jewish conspiracy" and opposition to "fundamental liberal values" are the gateway to violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There are so many strong, positive Muslim voices being drowned out," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Ask yourself, how is it possible that when young teenagers leave their London homes to fight for ISIL, the debate focuses on whether the security services are to blame?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>British police say some 700 potential terror suspects have travelled to Syria from Britain.</td></tr>
