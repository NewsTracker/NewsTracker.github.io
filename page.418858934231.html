<h3>YouTube shakes off Google+</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google is saying that it's time for Google+ to be going, going ... though not completely gone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The company announced Monday it will pull back Google+'s integration with Google products in an attempt to streamline the service, which has been panned by users who have been confused and annoyed at being forced into the network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>YouTube will be the first entity to split off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In the coming months, YouTubers will be able to create channels, upload videos and post comments with regular Google accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And beginning Monday, YouTube comments won't appear on Google+ or be linked to publicly searchable Google+ pages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>More uncoupling is on the way, said Bradley Horowitz, vice president of Streams, Photos, and Sharing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>FILE - In this April 17, 2007 file photo, exhibitors work on laptop computers in front of an illuminated Google logo at the industrial fair Hannover Messe in Hanover, Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It doesn't make sense for your Google+ profile to be your identity in all the other Google products you use," he wrote on Google's blog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For example, Google+ Photos has recently been re-purposed into Google Photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google+ launched in 2011 as a social network that allowed users to share links, photos and other media among "circles" of friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But it never came close to rivaling Facebook in popularity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A recent study by Stone Temple Consulting claims to have found that 90 percent of Google+ profiles contain no content, suggesting that many people joined only in order to link with services such as YouTube.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A Google representative said the company doesn't share metrics on how many Google+ profiles exist.</td></tr>
