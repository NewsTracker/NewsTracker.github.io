<h3>Facebook to host news from New York Times, BuzzFeed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The New York Times reported that Facebook is currently in talks with several publications to post their content directly within the social networking site, rather than news appearing as links and redirecting users to another page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Some of the publications Facebook is trying to sign a deal with include The New York Times, BuzzFeed and National Geographic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Over the past few years Facebook has made several attempts to be a front-runner in sharing and hosting news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It created its News Feed, a Techwire and it created an algorithm that filters out phony articles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>CEO Mark Zuckerberg even said that he wants Facebook to be "the best personalized newspaper in the world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This new model would be convenient since it keeps users within Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It would also decrease the eight-second loading time to fetch a story and probably increase traffic stories get.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, Facebook's new model would require news organizations to take a leap a faith, since publications are accustomed to the idea of keeping readers within their own site and accumulating personal data on them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Many news organizations depend on Facebook to redirect traffic to their stories and websites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With Facebook taking control of their content, accumulating traffic and data may become a challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Times also reports that this new initiative could include revenue-sharing schemes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Advertisements that publishers place on their stories would be removed and placed in a single as in a custom format.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Facebook said that revenue-sharing ideas are still in flux, but they are trying to work on different options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Facebook intends to start testing its new model in upcoming months, according to The Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Currently it's planning to launch with a few news organizations, but it might add others based on the model's success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Other news organizations that are rumored to be quietly working with Facebook include The Guardian, Quartz and Huffington Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Most have declined to comment on their involvement.</td></tr>
