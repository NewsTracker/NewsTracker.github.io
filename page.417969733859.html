<h3>EU extends sanctions against Russia by 6 months</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LUXEMBOURG (AP) -- The European Union on Monday extended economic sanctions against Russia until January to keep pressure on Moscow over the conflict in eastern Ukraine, drawing a rebuke and a warning of retaliation from Russian officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An EU statement said the decision was taken without debate by the bloc's foreign ministers at a meeting in Luxembourg, in response to "Russia's destabilizing role in eastern Ukraine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The sanctions, along with U.S. and other Western measures against Russia, have contributed to a softening of the Russian economy at a time when the price of oil that is crucial to its economic output has also fallen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The sanctions have also put a pinch on some of Russia's key EU trading partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The sanctions include limits to access on some financial markets, a ban on certain technologies and exchanges between the bloc and Russia in energy and defense sectors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Enacted last July and reinforced in September, the sanctions had been due to expire in July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They are now expected to expire on Jan. 31.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In response, Russia is expected to extend its ban on the import of many agricultural products from the EU, which was imposed as a countermeasure to the EU sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Since they were extended, we will act on the principle of reciprocity," said Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed rebels has killed more than 6,400 people in eastern Ukraine and persists despite a cease-fire agreed in Minsk, Belarus, in February that calls for the pullback of heavy weapons from the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday it was "deeply disappointed that once again in the EU, the view of the Russophobic lobby has prevailed" in the extension of the "illegal restrictions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The ministry said it was wrong to hold Russia fully responsible for the implementation of the Ukraine peace agreement and that the key to a settlement was in Kiev's hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The ministry also said "it looks particularly cynical" that the EU made the decision on June 22, the date in 1941 when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Russia still holds memorial services on this day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We would like to believe that this is a coincidence, not a specially designed step," the ministry statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the extension of sanctions was already likely before Monday's gathering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"In other words, all countries agreed," he told reporters during a break in the EU talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Because as long as the Minsk agreement is not fulfilled and also Russia has some responsibility for that, it was agreed that the measures would be extended."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the move to roll over the sanctions against Russia was "not an easy or a business-as-usual decision."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the EU's decision, and predicted that the array of punitive measures imposed by the West would "change the behavior of Moscow."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>EU sanctions "are a strong signal and a clear message that it has consequences when a country behaves in the way Russia has done in Ukraine," he told a news conference in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He said Western sanctions were having a clear impact on Russia's economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Christoph Noelting in Luxembourg, John-Thor Dahlburg in Brussels, and Lynn Berry in Moscow contributed to this report.</td></tr>
