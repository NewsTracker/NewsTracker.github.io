<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) " Hundreds of shoppers thronged through the reopened Westgate Shopping Mall in Kenya's capital, Nairobi nearly two years after a terrorist attack there left at least 67 people dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero cut a ribbon during Saturday's re-opening ceremony following two years of repairs after security forces battled four gunmen from Somalia's al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab group in September 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The attack led to a four-day siege of the building by security forces which destroyed part of the roof when they fired rocket propelled grenades at the attackers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Shoppers will get a 10 percent discount for every $30 spent at the 80,000 square foot (7,400 square meter) complex which is expected to employ more than 250 staff.</td></tr>
