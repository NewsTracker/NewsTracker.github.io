<h3>Islamic State militants raze Iraq's ancient Hatra city: Government</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Islamic State militants have destroyed ancient remains of the 2,000-year-old city of Hatra in northern Iraq, officials said on Saturday, in their latest attack on Iraqi antiquities which the United Nations condemned as barbarism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The antiquities and tourism ministry said it had received reports from the northern city of Mosul, which is under the control of the radical Islamist group, that the site at Hatra was demolished on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A ministry official said it was difficult to confirm the reports and the ministry had not received any pictures showing the extent of the damage at Hatra, listed as a U.N. world heritage site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But a resident told Reuters he heard a powerful explosion at Hatra early on Saturday and said that other people nearby had reported that Islamic State militants had destroyed some buildings there and were bulldozing other parts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hatra lies about 110 km south of Mosul, the largest city under Islamic State control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A week ago the militants released a video showing them smashing statues and carvings in the city's museum, home to priceless Assyrian and Hellenistic artefacts dating back 3,000 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Thursday they attacked the remains of the Assyrian city of Nimrud, south of Mosul, with bulldozers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned that attack, saying that targeting the world's "common cultural heritage" constituted a war crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Hatra dates back 2,000 years to the Seleucid empire which controlled a large part of the ancient world conquered by Alexander the Great.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It is famous for its striking pillared temple which blends Graeco-Roman and eastern architecture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The destruction of Hatra marks a turning point in the appalling strategy of cultural cleansing under way in Iraq," said Irina Bokova, head of the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This is a direct attack against the history of Islamic Arab cities, and it confirms the role of destruction of heritage in the propaganda of extremists groups," Bokova said in a joint statement with Abdulaziz Othman Altwaijri, Director General of the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Saeed Mamuzini, spokesman for the Mosul branch of the Kurdish Democratic Party, said the militants had used explosives to blow up buildings at Hatra and were also bulldozing it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The antiquities ministry said the lack of tough international response to earlier Islamic State attacks on Iraq's historic sites had encouraged the group to continue its campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The delay in international support for Iraq has encouraged terrorists to commit another crime of stealing and demolishing the remains of the city of Hatra," it said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Archaeologists have compared the assault on Iraq's cultural history to the Taliban's destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But the damage wreaked by Islamic State, not just on ancient monuments but also on rival Muslim places of worship, has been swift, relentless and more wide-ranging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Last week's video showed them toppling statues and carvings from plinths in the Mosul museum and smashing them with sledge hammers and drills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It also showed damage to a huge statue of a bull at the Nergal Gate into the city of Nineveh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Islamic State, which rules a self-declared caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria, promotes a fiercely purist interpretation of Sunni Islam which draws its inspiration from early Islamic history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It rejects religious shrines of any sort and condemns Iraq's majority Shi'ite Muslims as heretics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Last July it destroyed the tomb of the prophet Jonah in Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It has also attacked Shi'ite places of worship and last year gave Mosul's Christians an ultimatum to convert to Islam, pay a religious levy or face death by the sword.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It has also targeted the Yazidi minority in the Sinjar mountains west of Mosul.</td></tr>

<h3>Obama, George W. Bush to join 'Bloody Sunday' anniversary in Selma</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"There are places, and moments in America, where this nation's destiny has been decided," the president said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>"In one afternoon 50 years ago, so much of our turbulent history -- the stain of slavery and anguish of civil war; the yoke of segregation and tyranny of Jim Crow; the death of four little girls in Birmingham, and the dream of a Baptist preacher -- met on this bridge," Obama said, turning to Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>John Lewis, D-Ga., who was present at the march.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>Members of the group, which also included former first lady Laura Bush, joined hands on stage after the president's speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Obama, his wife, Michelle, and their daughters, Malia and Sasha, then walked about a third of the way across the bridge, accompanied by Lewis, who has given fellow lawmakers countless tours of this scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bush, his wife and scores of others came with them before a larger crowd followed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We have come to Selma to be reminded that we have do the work that justice and equality calls us to do," Lewis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tens of thousands of others also attended the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Congressional Republican leaders were absent from the event, but House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio released a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Today, 50 years after the Selma to Montgomery marches began, the House honors the brave foot soldiers who risked their lives to secure the blessings of liberty for all Americans," Boehner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Selma still struggles to overcome its legacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The city's population has declined by about 40 percent to 20,000 in the last 50 years and Dallas County's unemployment rate is nearly double the state average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Public schools in Selma are nearly all black; most whites go to private schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Blacks lead the annual "Bloody Sunday" commemoration; whites lead an annual re-enactment of the 1865 "Battle of Selma" to attract Civil War re-enactors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>For Obama, the trip to Selma marks the continued celebration by the first black U.S. president of three of the most important civil rights milestones in America's tortured racial history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We gather here to honor the courage of ordinary Americans willing to endure billy clubs and the chastening rod; tear gas and the trampling hoof; men and women who despite the gush of blood and splintered bone would stay true to their North Star and keep marching toward justice," Obama said Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In 2013, Obama spoke at the 50th anniversary celebration of Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Last year, he addressed the 50th anniversary of the signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by President Lyndon B. Johnson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Obama also looked forward, arguing that too much racism still persists in the United States and that the Voting Rights Act remains under siege.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We have to recognize that one day's commemoration, no matter how special, is not enough," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"If Selma taught us anything, it's that our work is never done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He added: "Our march is not yet finished."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He said the Justice Department's report on the Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>police department shows that not enough has changed in the country with respect to race relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"But I rejected the notion that nothing's changed," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"What happened in Ferguson may not be unique, but it's no longer endemic, or sanctioned by law and custom. And before the Civil Rights Movement, it most surely was."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Obama said last week that the family was coming to pay tribute "as Americans to those who changed the course of history" at the bridge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Not just the legends and the giants of the Civil Rights Movement like Dr. King and John Lewis, but the countless American heroes whose names aren't in the history books that aren't etched on marble somewhere - ordinary men and women from all corners of this nation, all walks of life, black and white, rich and poor, students, scholars, maids, ministers - all who marched and who sang and organized to change this country for the better," Obama said at a Black History Month observance at the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Obama also addressed the issue of voting rights in his State of the Union address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>His administration has challenged southern states that have imposed new voting requirements, including showing picture identification before being allowed to vote and curtailing opportunities to vote early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Critics of those laws say they have disenfranchised mostly minority voters and set back the gains won by civil rights marchers, including those who crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>A divided U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-4 in June 2013 to remove from federal law the most effective tool for fighting discrimination against voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Ruling in a case from Shelby County, Alabama, the high court eliminated the Justice Department's ability under the Voting Rights Act to identify and stop potentially discriminatory voting laws before they take effect.</td></tr>
