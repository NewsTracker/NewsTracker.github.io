<h3>Greek police say they're banned from parliament bathrooms</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Forget bailouts or austerity riots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The hot topic now in Greece is toilets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Police guarding Greece's parliament say they are no longer being allowed inside the building to use its bathrooms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Police Officers Association in Athens said in a statement Monday that uniformed officers have been recently banned from entering parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It urged the Public Order Ministry to intervene to stop police from being treated as "third-class citizens" in the building they have protected from numerous violent protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greece's governing left-wing Syriza party, which came to power in January, often sided with anti-austerity demonstrations outside parliament while condemning any violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Parliament refused to comment on the complaint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It later issued guidelines saying officers providing security at the building would in the future be dressed in civilian clothes with badges.</td></tr>
