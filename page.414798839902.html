<h3>Things to know about the Boston Marathon bombing trial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>So it goes in the trial of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Since a judge began questioning prospective jurors Jan. 15, six days of jury selection have been canceled because of weather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The expected start date for testimony in the trial has come and gone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tsarnaev, 21, faces 30 federal charges in connection with the twin explosions at the finish line of the marathon on April 15, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tsarnaev is also accused in the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer days after the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died following a gun battle with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prosecutors say the brothers planned and carried out the bombings to retaliate against the U.S. for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Jury selection began Jan. 5 as groups of potential jurors were called into federal court to fill out lengthy questionnaires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>More than 1,350 people took part.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Judge George O'Toole Jr., prosecutors and Tsarnaev's lawyers began questioning prospective jurors individually Jan. 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>O'Toole has asked potential jurors whether they have already formed an opinion about Tsarnaev's guilt and, if so, whether they believe they can put that aside and decide the case based only on evidence presented during the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The judge and the attorneys also probe prospective jurors on their feelings about the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>To be eligible to serve as a juror in a death penalty trial, jurors must express a willingness to meaningfully consider both the death penalty and life in prison as possible punishments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Six days of jury selection have been lost because of three snowstorms, starting with a blizzard that hit the region at the end of January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Court has been closed two days each week for three consecutive weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The court follows the closing schedule of the Boston public schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On days when the schools are closed because of inclement weather, jury service is canceled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The judge had originally predicted that opening statements in the trial would be Jan. 26, but that did not happen because of the weather delays and a slower-than-expected pace of juror questioning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>No new date has been given, though the judge wrote in a Feb. 6 ruling that "substantial progress" has been made toward a goal of finding 70 prospective jurors who are capable of being fair and impartial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers have argued repeatedly that he cannot get a fair trial in Massachusetts because of the emotional impact the bombings had here and the many people who have personal connections to the marathon, people injured in the attack and the first responders who helped them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The judge has rejected three defense requests to move the trial out of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But on Thursday, a federal appeals court granted the defense's request to hold a hearing on the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The questioning of prospective jurors - known as voir dire - is scheduled to continue Tuesday in federal court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>On Thursday, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments on the defense request to order the judge to move the trial outside Massachusetts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It is unclear how long the appeals court will take to make a decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Meanwhile, voir dire will continue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>As of Feb. 12, the judge had questioned 183 prospective jurors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He has not said how many of those people have been excused, though it appeared from the questioning that many of them were dismissed because of the financial hardship serving on a lengthy trial would cause, because they had already formed a strong opinion about Tsarnaev's guilt or because they said they would be unwilling to consider the death penalty under any circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Once the judge has a pool of approximately 70 people, each side will get to eliminate 23 people for strategic reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The judge has said he will seat a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates.</td></tr>

<h3>Amid measles outbreak, few rules on teacher vaccinations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>While much of the attention in the ongoing measles outbreak has focused on student vaccination requirements and exemptions, less attention has been paid to another group in the nation's classrooms: Teachers and staff members, who by and large are not required to be vaccinated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>LOS ANGELES (AP) - While much of the attention in the ongoing measles outbreak has focused on student vaccination requirements and exemptions, less attention has been paid to another group in the nation's classrooms: Teachers and staff members, who, by and large, are not required to be vaccinated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In most states, there is no law dictating which vaccines teachers and school staff workers are required to get.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some states provide a list of recommended vaccines, but there is no requirement or follow-up for teachers to receive them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>So when a measles case surfaced at a California high school, it was easy for officials to review student records, but there were no immunization records on file for employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That meant all 24 teachers and staff exposed to the employee with measles had to prove their immunity - records that, for most, were decades old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The issue has surfaced from time to time in state legislatures and is likely to be raised again in response to the latest outbreak, which originated at Disneyland in December and has spread to a half dozen states and Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Most of those who fell ill were not vaccinated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As of Friday, public health officials said 114 people had contracted measles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I was definitely shocked," Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Joanna Cole, a Democrat in the Vermont Legislature, said when she learned in 2012 that there were no teacher vaccination requirements in her state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There are still no requirements today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I guess we all just assumed that they would have them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Cole and other legislators and parents across the U.S. believe the blanket presumption that teachers are up to date on their vaccines should be re-examined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They note that most of those sickened in the current outbreak are adults, and that schools are one of the top places for the spread of communicable disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I will be surprised if we don't see some changes in the next year to year and a half," said Kristen Amundson, executive director of the National Association of School Boards of Education.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Already, some states are considering measles legislation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In Vermont, Democratic Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>George Till says legislators will try this year to eliminate philosophical exemptions for students and require that teachers be up to date on the same vaccines students must receive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"If we're trying to limit the spread in school, why just students?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Till said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A similar bill he introduced in 2012 was defeated amid strong opposition from anti-vaccine groups, and he expects another battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In Colorado, pro-vaccination groups have been pushing the Department of Human Services to require vaccinations for workers at child care facilities, another area with uneven employee immunization standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Measles cases have been confirmed at day care facilities in Chicago and Santa Monica, California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Barbara Loe Fisher, director of the National Vaccine Information Center, a Virginia-based nonprofit that favors letting parents decide whether to vaccinate, said the discussion on vaccination requirements has started to expand from schoolchildren to certain adult professions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>She said her organization has a number of concerns about requiring teacher vaccinations, including safety and job protection for those who cannot or choose not to be immunized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I think at the end of the day, the most important principle to protect is the right to make an informed voluntary decision, and that includes teachers," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>At Vista Murrieta High School in California's Riverside County, a middle class community between Los Angeles and San Diego, all teachers and staff who had been exposed to the measles were able to return to work within one to three days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Teachers who were born before 1957 were immediately excused, assuming they had either had gotten measles as a child or been exposed to the disease.</td></tr>
