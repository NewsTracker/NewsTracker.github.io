<h3>Ethiopian Tigist Tufa wins London Marathon to end four years of Kenyan domination</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ethiopia's Tigist Tufa ended Kenya's domination of the women's race at the Virgin Money London Marathon with a shock victory on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 28-year-old, who was only the ninth-fastest in the field, seized a cagey race by the scruff of the neck in the closing stages to pull clear of the field and was able to wave to the crowds as she came down The Mall to win by 18 seconds from Mary Keitany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was the biggest win of her career and ended four years of domination by Kenya's women in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She crossed the line in an unofficial time of two hours 23 minutes and 22 seconds to become the first Ethiopian women's champion since Derartu Tulu in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Another Ethiopian, Tirfi Tsegaye, came home in third place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As well as Paula Radcliffe's farewell, the race had been billed as a four-way fight between a quartet of Kenyans: defending champion Edna Kiplagat, two-time former champion Keitany, half-marathon world record holder Florence Kiplagat and Priscah Jeptoo, the winner in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tufa had barely been mentioned in the build-up, but, beneath overcast skies in the capital, the slow pace played into her hands and she produced a 25th mile of 5mins 07secs to break her rivals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>From that point on there was only one winner.</td></tr>
