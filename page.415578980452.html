<h3>Many Democrats want independent Clinton email probe: Reuters/Ipsos poll</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Support for Clinton's candidacy has dropped about 15 percentage points since mid-February among Democrats, with as few as 45 percent saying they would support her in the last week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Support from Democrats likely to vote in the party nominating contests has dropped only slightly less, to a low in the mid-50s over the same period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Even Democrats who said they were not personally swayed one way or another by the email flap said that Clinton could fare worse because of it, if and when she launches her presidential campaign, a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The polling showed that nearly half of Democratic respondents - 46 percent - agreed there should be an independent review of all of Clinton's emails to ensure she turned over everything that is work-related.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There was also sizable support among Democrats for the Republican-controlled congressional committee's effort to require Clinton to testify about the emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Forty-one percent said they backed its efforts to force Clinton's testimony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Bottom line is if she didn't do anything wrong, she's fine," said North Carolina resident Renetia Lowery, 48, a Democrat and survey respondent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The online poll of 2,128 adults from March 10 to March 17 showed that Americans, including two-thirds of Democrats, were aware of the controversy surrounding Clinton's decision to use her personal email rather than a government account, along with a personal server, when she was the top U.S. diplomat from 2009 to 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clinton has tried to tamp down accusations that she used her personal email account to keep her records from public review, which would support an old political narrative that Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, are secretive and seek to play by a different set of rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>More than a third of Democrats and 44 percent of political independents agreed that the email issue has hurt the former secretary of state politically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Democratic strategist Ben LaBolt, a former spokesman for President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, said that the email controversy has been a "galvanizing call for the Clinton campaign-in-waiting to build an organization," by hiring top political communicators who can defend her record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Clinton, who ran for the White House in 2008 and lost to Obama, is expected to announce as early as April that she plans to seek the White House in the November 2016 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Former congressional and Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon, White House aide Jennifer Palmieri, and Jesse Ferguson, who has handled press for Democratic congressional campaigns, are expected to be among the communications experts joining Clinton's campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>All three are respected in Democratic political circles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Clinton told a packed room of reporters this month that she used her personal email for official business for the sake of convenience, because it was easier to carry only one device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I admire the fact that she has been so strong on a lot of different things, she stands up for what she believes in, but I do think the emails will hurt her, unfortunately," said Patricia Peacock, 49, of Lewiston, Maine, who took part in the survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Clinton's office said she has since turned over paper copies of more than 30,000 work emails last year at the State Department's request, but did not hand over about 32,000 that were private or personal records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Among the emails turned over were 300 related to a 2012 attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi that led to the death of a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, which were subsequently handed over to a Republican-led congressional committee investigating the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The panel has subpoenaed Clinton's remaining emails and said they would like her to testify on the matter before April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>About half of Democrats said they thought Clinton was composed during the March 10 news conference, but 14 percent found her evasive and 17 percent said she avoided answering questions directly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Survey respondent Tom Trevathan, 74, a retired math professor from Arkansas, said he was "less than happy" with Clinton's performance at the news conference.</td></tr>

<h3>Pro-ISIS Twitter account ?predicted? Tunisia massacre</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ISIS claimed responsibility Thursday for the museum massacre in Tunisia and called the attack "a blessed invasion of one of the dens of infidels."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a message posted to an Internet forum known for supporting ISIS, the terror group warns that the bloodshed has only just begun, and labeled the two terrorists killed during Wednesday's strike "knights of the Islamic State."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The slain terrorists who took hostages in the Bardo Museum were identified Thursday as Tunisians who reportedly spent time in Iraq and Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>ISIS said the only reason the two died when authorities stormed the museum is that they ran out of bullets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Following the massacre that claimed 23 innocent lives, authorities arrested nine people, including four being questioned about direct links to the attack and five others who had ties to a terror cell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tunisia was still on edge after the terrorists went on their midday rampage in the capital of Tunis - gunning down tourists getting off buses and slaughtering hostages during a standoff with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Of the 23 people killed by terrorists, 20 were foreigners, said officials, who added that another 44 were wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Among the victims was Sally Adey, 57, a mother of two and the only British citizen believed killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Her husband, Robert, 52, is believed to have survived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The day after the carnage, harrowing tales of survival emerged, including those of a woman who smeared blood over her body to "play dead" and two terrified tourists who stayed hidden inside the Bardo Museum overnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We were all crammed together on top of each other and there were lots of wounded," a French woman identified only as Maryline told France Info radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Two others who also escaped were Juan Carlos Sanchez and Cristina Rubio, Spanish tourists who survived after hiding out in the museum all night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>US officials said they are looking into ISIS's claims that it was behind the massacre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This was not a lone-wolf attack," said a source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Unfortunately, they were the real thing, not amateurs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The source added: "I don't think another attack in Tunisia is imminent. The authorities there are on high alert so they'll lie low for a while."</td></tr>
