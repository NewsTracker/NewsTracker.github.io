<h3>North Korea says Mexico holding ship; kept under sanctions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hun said Mexico has "forcibly detained" one of its ships months after it ran aground off Mexico's Gulf coast and that his country will take unspecified "necessary measures to make the ship leave immediately."</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>UNITED NATIONS (AP) - North Korea said Wednesday that Mexico has "forcibly detained" one of its ships months after it ran aground off Mexico's Gulf coast last year, and Pyongyang blames the United States for making sure the ship is not released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The head of a U.N. panel of experts, however, said the ship, the Mu Du Bong, is owned by a North Korean company that is under U.N. sanctions and should be "frozen," and that the panel has received excellent cooperation from Mexico in tracking the company and its assets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"In the case of the Mu Du Bong, the evidence is overwhelming," Hugh Griffiths told The Associated Press in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The U.N. sanctions were imposed in response to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The ship's parent company, Ocean Maritime Management Co., was sanctioned last July after Panamanian authorities found two Cuban fighter jets, missiles and live munitions beneath a cargo of sugar in another ship the company operated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>OMM responded by simply renaming most of its vessels in an effort to avoid detection, the panel reported earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>North Korea has a history of using front companies for that purpose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>North Korea's deputy permanent representative to the U.N. told reporters Wednesday that his country will take unspecified "necessary measures to make the ship leave immediately."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An Myong Hun said the Mu Du Bong is strictly a commercial ship and that more than 50 crew members remain on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He denied that the ship was carrying anything prohibited by U.N. sanctions and said it has no relations with OMM.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The North Korean diplomat also said Mexican authorities in January had decided to release the ship but "suddenly" revoked its decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The U.N. panel's report, released in February, said the experts had informed Mexican authorities that the ship is an OMM asset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The ship ran aground last July and damaged nearly an acre of coral reefs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The North Korean embassy in Mexico was asked to post a 10-million peso ($770,000) bond for any damage assessment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The North Korean diplomat said his country has paid the necessary fees and has "no legal obligation" to wait to move the ship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>There was no immediate comment from the U.S. mission to the U.N., or from the Mexican government.</td></tr>
