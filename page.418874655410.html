<h3>AP Sources: Michel Platini will run for FIFA president</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Michel Platini will run for FIFA president and plans to announce his intentions this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Two officials familiar with Platini's plans have told The Associated Press that the FIFA vice president has made a decision to try to succeed Sepp Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because Platini has not announced his candidacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The officials said that the UEFA president and former France great has been encouraged to run by most leaders of FIFA's continental confederations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Five of the six continental leaders, including Platini, were in St. Petersburg, Russia, last week for FIFA meetings and the 2018 World Cup qualifying draw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Platini declined to discuss his ambitions when asked by the AP in St. Petersburg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The FIFA election is on Feb. 26 and would-be candidates must apply by Oct. 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Platini is set to be the first serious contender to announce he will stand, two months after Blatter was re-elected for a fifth four-year term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Two former FIFA vice presidents from Asia are also possible contenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, who lost a 133-73 vote to Blatter on May 29 with Platini's public support, and South Korean politician Chung Mong-joon have made public statements about the election in recent days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Blatter was Platini's long-time mentor in FIFA politics until a rift developed as the 79-year-old Swiss hung on to office in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After 17 years as FIFA president, Blatter said on June 2 he was standing down, under pressure from American and Swiss federal investigations of corruption implicating senior FIFA officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Platini has not been linked to any wrongdoing, though his vote for Qatar as 2022 World Cup host has proved controversial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He was the first FIFA executive committee member to reveal who he voted for in the December 2010 hosting ballots that also gave the 2018 event to Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Platini, who turned 60 last month, chose last year not to oppose Blatter in the recent election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Now is not my time, not yet," Platini said last August in Monaco when announcing he would focus on getting a third term at UEFA, which he won in March unopposed for a second straight time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>His rise to the top job in European football in 2007 owed a little to Blatter's help and showed how much recent history they share in the game of soccer politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Platini ousted veteran UEFA leader Lennart Johansson of Sweden in a 27-23 vote which perhaps swung on his promise to add eight teams to the European Championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The larger 24-team event will debut in Platini's home country of France in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Blatter also beat Johansson to get his FIFA job, in a 1998 election in Paris dogged by allegations of late vote-buying by supporters of Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Then, Platini was doing double duty as head of the 1998 World Cup organizing committee and as a campaign manager for Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>There is no suggestion Platini was involved in election wrongdoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Platini joined Blatter in Zurich after a successful World Cup, won by France, as a presidential adviser for four years before winning a FIFA executive committee seat representing UEFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In eight years leading European soccer, Platini has tried to please less powerful voting federations by giving their national and club teams better chances to advance in UEFA competitions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Second-tier matches such as the Europa League final and Super Cup have been sent to Romania, Switzerland, Wales and Georgia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Platini's Euro 2020 project will see 13 countries host the continent-wide tournament, including Azerbaijan and Hungary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>However, Platini's reign has seen the Champions League dominated by an elite group of wealthy clubs from the richest soccer nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>His signature "Financial Fair Play" policy designed to curb clubs overspending has seemed only to cement the elite in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>If elected FIFA's ninth president in 112 years, and third Frenchman, Platini will be the best player to occupy the office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Platini is among the great No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>10s in history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He won three Ballon d'Or awards as the best player in Europe and lifted two of the three biggest team prizes open to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He captained France to win the 1984 European Championship - his nine-goal performance in his home country ranks among the finest individual tournament displays - and scored the winning goal for Juventus in the 1985 European Cup final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Only FIFA's World Cup eluded him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>France lost semifinal matches to West Germany in 1982 and 1986.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Platini's achievements would be neatly completed by becoming FIFA president.</td></tr>
