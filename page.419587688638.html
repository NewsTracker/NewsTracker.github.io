<h3>Apple touchscreen patent appeal rejected</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FRANKFURT - Apple Inc. patents covering the "slide to unlock" feature on smartphones are invalid, Germany's highest appeals court ruled on Tuesday, reaffirming a 2013 decision rejecting the U.S. company's claims by a lower court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The ruling by the Federal Court of Appeals in Karlsruhe covers one of the Apple iPhone's most popular defining features, of which makers of rival Android-based phones have developed their own versions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a statement, the appeals court said it confirmed a ruling by the lower Federal Patent Court that cancelled Apple's German patent, based on the technique's similarity to a phone released by Swedish company Neonode Inc. a year before the iPhone's 2007 launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Neonode N1 had substantially similar technical features, the patent court had found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It ruled Apple's easier-to-use interface was not in itself patentable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Neonode sold tens of thousands of phones before declaring bankruptcy in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It reorganized itself as an intellectual property firm licensing its patented optical technology for use in phones, tablets, readers and other touchscreen devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Motorola Mobility, at the time a unit of Google Inc but now owned by China's Lenovo Group Ltd., filed the original suit in a Munich court against the Apple user interface patent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Apple won that case but the ruling was later overturned by the federal patent court.</td></tr>
