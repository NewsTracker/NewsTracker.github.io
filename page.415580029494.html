<h3>Tesla updating Model S to ease range anxiety, improve safety</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tesla's latest update - which will be beamed to owners automatically in about 10 days - will map out the best route to a driver's destination based on the location of charging stations and will guide the car to available spots to charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The car will also warn drivers if battery power is low before they drive beyond an area where they can charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It will take into account elevation, wind speed, air conditioning use and other factors that can deplete the battery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"You don't need to think ahead and make any calculations," Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during a conference call to announce the update.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The car will always take care of you."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Musk said Tesla is also working on an automatic steering feature on test drives between San Francisco and Seattle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That feature - which could be added with another software update about three months from now - would allow automatic, hands-free driving on a highway with well-marked lanes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Model S can travel up to 270 miles on a single battery charge, which is more than double the range of other electric cars on the market, such as the Nissan Leaf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Musk said owners generally find that's enough to get them where they need to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But range remains a concern for many potential buyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Range is generally one of the issues people have about electric cars, and it is an important thing to address really emphatically," Musk said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tesla will update all Model S sedans globally for free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There are about 56,000 Model S sedans on the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The company's Model X SUV, which will go on sale later this year, will also have the new software.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Musk said the software will give preference to the company's Supercharger stations - which can almost fully charge a Model S in 30 minutes - but it will also point out other charging points along a route.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Currently, 90 percent of the U.S. population is within 175 miles of a Supercharger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Europe, Canada and parts of China will soon have similar coverage, Musk said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The update will also add several safety features, including automatic emergency braking, blind spot detection and a side collision warning system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Many of those features are already standard in other luxury cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Musk caused a frenzy last Sunday when he tweeted that Tesla was "about to end range anxiety" with a software update.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But he might have raised investors' expectations a little too much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Tesla's shares fell $2.80, or 1.4 percent, to $197.91 in afternoon trading after the announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book, says the update won't fully eliminate the anxiety over range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"One could argue such aggressive warnings will only remind drivers how critical it is to get to a charging stating before draining the battery pack," he said.</td></tr>
