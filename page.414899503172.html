<h3>Fears for Syria-bound London schoolgirls suspected of trying to join Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>London: Three schoolgirls have fled the UK in a suspected bid to travel to Syria and join the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and an un-named 15-year-old, all from east London, flew to Istanbul, in Turkey, from Gatwick airport on Tuesday without leaving any messages behind for family or friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Scotland Yard detectives urgently appealed for information about the missing girls, who all go to the Bethnal Green Academy school and were described as "straight-A students".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Commander Richard Walton, head of the Metropolitan Police's counter terror command, said the runaways were good friends with another 15-year-old girl who fled to Syria in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said the force was becoming "increasingly concerned" about a growing trend of young girls showing an interest or intent in joining IS, an organisation now notorious for its barbaric treatment of hostages and oppression of women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Walton added the teenagers' families were "devastated" but there was a "good chance" the girls were still in Turkey.</td></tr>
