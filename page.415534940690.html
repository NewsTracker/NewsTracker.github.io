<h3>GOP House Budget Plans for Future Economic and Global Threats</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>All of these, in the view of Price and other conservatives, threaten America's future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Whether one agrees with the grim assessment or not, the priorities and assumptions behind it are critical to understand, as they'll drive many of the legislative priorities of the 114th Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>First is a conviction that the federal deficit and long-term debt will slowly strangle the country's economy unless they're handled in the near term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"America's fiscal position is unsustainable," the document says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Publicly held debt as a share of the economy is nearly 75 percent, and total debt exceeds 100 percent. As baby boomers retire and the cost of the nation's health and retirement programs soar, this share of debt will increase unabated in future years, absent reform. Interest payments on the debt alone will sum to a whopping $5.6 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. These payments will swamp other spending priorities in the budget."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The budget deficit and rising interest payments, it adds, "could also erode our military and diplomatic standing in the world and undermine our national security at a time when America, our allies and our interests are under threat from radical global jihadists and rogue regimes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Price's budget claims to bring the federal budget into balance within 10 years, in part by slashing $5.5 trillion in spending over that time period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It would put the level of debt on a downward path, slowly reducing the share of federal outlays dedicated to debt service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Related: Block Grants Can Tame the Budget, But at What Cost?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The U.S., according to Price, is also threatened by lackluster economic growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The economy is not working for many Americans. A lot of people are struggling to keep up or are being left behind Our economy is not reaching its full potential."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The culprits here are "out-of-control spending, higher taxes, and burdensome regulations," according to Price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Every dollar taken for taxes or to service the debt through interest payments is a dollar that can't be used to pay rent, buy a house, expand a business, buy a car, send a child to college, or care for a family member. All the things Americans want to do are being harmed and made more difficult by the president's policies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The budget calls for comprehensive tax reform, the repeal of restrictive (including much of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill signed into law after the financial crisis) and a major increase in U.S. energy extraction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The budget says that would reduce spending and bring down prices for average Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Another assumption is that the Affordable Care Act is a mortal threat to the health care system in the U.S. Again, many would dispute that, but it is a driving element of how the budget deals with health care spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In this worldview, unless Obamacare is eliminated root and branch, no other repairs to the health care system are possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Obamacare is not working for America's families, doctors or employers," it reads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Once Obamacare is gone, the plan would shift Medicare into a "premium support" system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>(Many economists see that as vouchers by another name.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It would transform Medicaid into a kind of modified block grant program managed mostly by the states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The budget does not directly address how millions of Americans newly covered under Medicaid and plans sold on the ACA's health care exchanges would find coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But it praises "patient-centered health care" and the market's power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The goal is to empower patients - whether we are talking about increasing competition and transparency in the health insurance market or allowing individuals to join together voluntarily to pool risk so no person is priced out of the market even if they have a pre-existing condition."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The budget also assumes the U.S. is under direct threat of attack from various bad actors around the world - and that we must increase our defense budget, though it's already larger than the combined defense budgets of the next 10 biggest spenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Today, our nation, our allies and our interests at home and around the world are threatened by radical Islamic terrorists as well as unstable and oppressive regimes," it finds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>As a result, the Price budget hikes defense spending sharply, in part by using a vehicle called the Overseas Contingency Operations fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The OCO is off-budget spending, meaning it doesn't technically add to the deficit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It is supposed to be used to fund the ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Yet under the Price budget, it appears a portion of the money would go to the Pentagon to fund programs normally accounted for in the budget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Price's budget sees a U.S. in which the social safety net is failing those it's supposed to help, largely because of the hubris of the federal bureaucrats running it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>There's a place for safety net programs, he allows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>However: "Our charge is to address these challenges in a way that is compassionate and constructive - mindful of the fact that Washington does not hold the answer to every question. Government must respect its limits."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Price budget consolidates many existing social programs, pushing them down in large part to the states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Most notably, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as Food Stamps, becomes a state-level program funded by federal grants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Finally, in Price's view (though he's hardly the first to say this), Washington is a hotbed of waste, fraud and abuse, enabled by an unaccountable government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"All of Washington ought to face scrutiny - every department, agency and program," the proposal says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"And once tax dollars are sent out the door, there ought to be in place a system to better track the efficiency and effectiveness of the initiatives being funded. More accountability from departments and agencies means a government that's more respectful and responsive to the needs of its people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Price's Democratic counterpart on the Budget Committee, ranking member Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), said in a statement Tuesday, "Congressional Republicans have been quick to pay lip service to wanting to help working families - but this budget means that Americans who are working harder than ever will be getting even less.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"It does nothing to boost the paychecks of working Americans and makes it harder to buy a home," added Van Hollen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"Students will see deep education cuts and college will be less affordable. And this budget takes away the tools that allow people to climb the ladder of opportunity."</td></tr>

<h3>4 more aid workers flown back to US for Ebola monitoring</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>On Tuesday, March 17, 2015, health officials said four more medical aid workers have been flown from West Africa to the United States, for monitoring for Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The latest arrivals bring to 16 the number of aid workers evacuated in the last week from Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Four more American aid workers arrived back in the United States on Tuesday from West Africa to be monitored for Ebola, health officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The latest arrivals bring to 15 the number of aid workers who have returned from Sierra Leone since Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>None of them have been diagnosed with Ebola, but they will be isolated and monitored during the next three weeks for signs of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Officials have released few details, citing patient privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But all are connected to - or had direct physical contact with - another American who came down with Ebola last week in Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The unidentified man is in critical condition at a National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The other aid workers are staying near the Maryland hospital or hospitals in Atlanta and Omaha with special isolation units - in case they become sick, according to officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The sick American works with Partners in Health, a Boston-based international aid organization that has been treating patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone since November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Organization officials did not respond to calls and emails from The Associated Press on Monday or Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In a statement Tuesday, co-founder Dr. Paul Farmer said the group is working with the CDC and others to investigate how the man was infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Ebola virus is spread through contact with a sick patient's blood or bodily fluids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The World Health Organization estimates the virus has killed more than 10,000 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>While deaths have slowed dramatically in recent months, the virus appears stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Since last summer, several U.S. aid workers have gotten Ebola and have been flown back to the U.S. for care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A few other individuals have returned for monitoring; none got sick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The aid workers who have returned since Friday are by far the largest group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>And more may be on their way later this week, CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harben said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The sick American worker was working at a government hospital in Port Loko in western Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But medical superintendent Dr. Peter George said the hospital hasn't had any Ebola cases for quite some time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He said it's likely the man also worked at a nearby Ebola treatment center, which George also manages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>George said a Partners in Health colleague told him the American passed out while at the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"At that time, nobody knew it was Ebola, so they assisted him," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Everyone who was working on the ward with the man is now being monitored, George said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He said that many of the foreigners working in Port Loko, including some of the Americans, live at the same tent camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He did not know if the sick health worker was living there.</td></tr>
