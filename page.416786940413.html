<h3>Russian report blames Kiev for downing of MH17 airliner-newspaper</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MOSCOW, May 6 (Reuters) - An independent Russian newspaper on Wednesday published what it said was a report by Russian military engineers suggesting a Malaysian airliner shot down in Ukraine was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile fired by Ukrainian forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Novaya Gazeta, an investigative newspaper, said the report did not prove whether Kiev's forces or the pro-Russian separatists they are fighting had shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 on July 17 last year, killing all 298 people aboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But it said the report, the authenticity of which could not be independently verified by Reuters, debunked one of the main theories put forward by the Russian government - that the airliner was shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Each side in the conflict in eastern Ukraine accuses the other of bringing down the plane, on which two-thirds of the victims were Dutch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It is most likely that Flight MH17 was destroyed in mid-air by the impact of a 9M38M1 surface-to-air missile ... the main missile in the 'BUK-M1' system," said the report published by Novaya Gazeta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The report, which the newspaper published in full, said the military engineers' calculations, largely based on open sources, suggested the plane was fired on from a position where Ukrainian government forces' BUK missile systems were stationed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dutch prosecutors say the "leading scenario" in their investigation is that the plane was hit by a BUK missile and are testing the theory it was fired from a separatist-held area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Russian officials, who initially said the plane was hit by a Ukrainian fighter jet, have deflected any blame and deny allegations by NATO and Kiev that Moscow has provided the rebels with heavy weapons and soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Novaya Gazeta, which is often critical of President Vladimir Putin, said it appeared the report had been drawn up by Moscow to send to the Dutch investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This report does not end things, it raises new doubts and new questions. The main ones are: where was the BUK-M1 fired from and who fired it?" the newspaper wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Kiev has dismissed Russian allegations that its forces shot down the airliner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Russia's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
