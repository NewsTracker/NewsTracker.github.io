<h3>Germanwings plane crash: how the cockpit door lock works</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Evidence from the Germanwings cockpit voice recorder indicates that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Here is how the aircraft crew is supposed to lock and unlock the cockpit door, based on a video by Airbus, the manufacturer of the plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The cockpit door locks by default when it is closed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If a crew member wants to enter the cockpit, he or she must first call the pilot using an intercom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The crew member then presses the pound key on the codepad, setting off a buzzer inside the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On the cockpit pedestal next to the pilot is a door-control toggle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The pilot sets the toggle to the "unlock" position to let the crew member in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If the pilot is incapacitated, the door lock can be overridden using a special emergency code on the keypad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However, the pilot, or someone else present in the cockpit, can prevent access by moving the door toggle to the "lock" position, which disables emergency access for five minutes.</td></tr>
