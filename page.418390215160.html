<h3>SEE IT: Naked man speeds off in New Mexico police car</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Video shows the moment a naked man sped off in a stolen cop car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A New Mexico police officer sent to stop the 37-year-old from running in traffic was left feeling stripped when the suspect took off in his police cruiser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A Curry County Sheriff's deputy responded to the scene along State Road 245 in Clovis, N.M., just before midnight Saturday and found the bare-backed man, who said he'd been poisoned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jesus Tarango obliged police at first, sitting down on the side of the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But Tarango quickly jumped up and ran into traffic once more before lying face-down on the hood of a Curry County Sheriff's cruiser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Ok, that's my car," the deputy told Tarango in an incident caught on the officer's body cam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"No one's in there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That's when Tarango sprung up and leapt into the driver's seat of the cop car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Sir! Sir! Hey, get out of there," the deputy shouted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tarango screeched off in the police cruiser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tarango, who suffered unspecified injuries, drove to a nearby hospital, where he was arrested a short time later.</td></tr>
