<h3>Greece fears over bailout grow; Spain sees deal within days</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras gives a speech during an economic conference in Athens, on Friday, May 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tsipras said that his country's left-wing government is "very close" to reaching a vital deal with bailout lenders, but insists there is "no possibility of retreat" on demands to further axe pensions and wages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A man looks at the 140 B.C. bronze statue of a young jockey riding a horse during the International Day Museum with free entrance for the visitors, at the Archeological museum in Athens on Monday, May 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece's cash-strapped government signaled Monday it needs a deal with bailout lenders by the end of the month to keep up loan repayments though the summer, as renewed concern rattled markets and saw borrowing rates shoot up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras gives a speech at the annual conference of the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises in Athens, on Monday, May 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tsipras said his radical left-led government has done all it can to seek an agreement with bailout creditors that will ease the country out of its current acute liquidity crunch - which he blamed on "tough negotiating tactics" by the country's creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Earlier Monday, the government signaled it needs a deal with lenders by the end of the month to avoid defaulting on its debt, as renewed concern rattled the country's finance markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said Monday that he expects an agreement with bailout creditors within the next week, which would save the cash-strapped country from fast-approaching bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I think we are very close," Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Let's say (it's a matter) of about a week."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>For almost four months, Greece's radical left-led government has been haggling with its creditors from the 19-country eurozone and International Monetary Fund over economic reforms it must make to secure a 7.2 billion euro ($8 billion) cash injection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That is the final payment due from the country's 240 billion-euro bailout program, launched five years ago after Greece's public finances spiraled out of control and it was locked out of international bond markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In a late-night interview with private Star TV, Varoufakis said creditors also appear to believe that the time is ripe for a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But he insisted that he would reject any compromise that the radical left-led government in Athens considers to be "non-viable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Earlier, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said the country has tabled detailed proposals for a viable deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But he warned that Greece is in a state of "financial strangulation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Over the past few weeks, Greece has survived by scraping together cash from reserve accounts to pay debts as well as day-to-day commitments like wages and pensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>However, Athens admits it is running out of options as further debt repayments come due next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>If no deal is agreed, Tsipras' government may be faced with a choice of what to pay, imposing capital controls or even leaving the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I assure you that if we face a dilemma between paying a creditor who refuses to sign an agreement with us and a pensioner, we will pay the pensioner," Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I hope we will be able to pay both."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Tsipras also faulted Greece's creditors for the liquidity crunch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The lack of liquidity is neither the choice nor the responsibility of the Greek government," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"It is a tough negotiating tactic of our partners, and I do not know whether everybody in Europe feels proud of it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis said that to honor its debt obligations this summer, Greece needs more financial assistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As a result, Sakellaridis expects a deal with creditors "by the end of May."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Markets appear to be uncertain about how the latest episode in the Greek debt crisis will pan out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Though uncertainty over Greece caused the interest rate on the government's two-year bonds - a gauge of default risk - surge about 3 percentage points on Monday to above 24 percent, the Athens Stock Exchange closed 1.6 percent higher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In the talks, Athens is proposing reform measures that might protect Greeks hammered by a six-year recession, but lenders say the proposals are too vague.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Varoufakis said the main sticking points include demanded pension and labor reforms, as well as the height of the primary budget surplus - which excludes the cost of servicing Greece's huge debt - in coming years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Government officials have suggested that Athens could seek popular approval for the final deal, through elections or a referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But Varoufakis said he didn't expect either, and the agreement would be ratified in parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He said it would be "foolish" to hold elections just months after the government came to power, adding that any referendum would effectively be a vote on whether to keep or lose the euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"And it would be unfair for Greek citizens to have to take a position on such a matter, answering with either a yes or a no," Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Athens has already pooled cash reserves from schools, hospitals and local government to fund the state's debt payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>And Sakellaridis confirmed the government this month used a reserve account with money in a currency unit used by the IMF to repay a loan to the Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Sakellaridis also insisted Greece would not accept a one-off bank deposit levy to resolve the cash crisis - a similar measure had been used in eurozone member Cyprus two years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>An elderly street vendor using a wheelchair holds a beach umbrella to protect from the sun in Athens on Monday, May 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>A tourist looks an ancient Greek sculpture of a kouros nude male youth, during the International Day Museum with free entrance for the visitors, at the Archeological museum in Athens on Monday, May 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>A tourist with the Greek flag stamp on his T-shirt passes the 600 B.C. ancient Greek sculpture of a kouros nude male youth, during the International Day Museum with free entrance for the visitors, at the Archeological museum in Athens on Monday, May 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>A woman takes a photograph with her cell phone, of the 140 B.C. bronze statue of a young jockey riding a horse, during the International Day Museum with free entrance for the visitors, at the Archeological museum in Athens on Monday, May 18, 2015.</td></tr>
