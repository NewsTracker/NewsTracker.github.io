<h3>Microsoft makes cheaper version of Surface Pro 3 tablet</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK - Microsoft is making a cheaper version of its Surface Pro 3 tablet computer in an effort to reach students and budget-conscious families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The new $499 version will have a smaller screen - 10.8 inches rather than 12 - a slower processor, and the built-in kickstand won't be as flexible, just three angles rather than the unlimited positions offered on the Pro 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the Pro 3 ranges from $799 to $1,949.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A keyboard cover, one of the Surface's distinctive features, will cost $129 extra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Microsoft bills the Surface line as a laptop replacement when used with the cover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Microsoft Corp. expects to ship the new device around May 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Advance orders starting immediately.</td></tr>
