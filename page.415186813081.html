<h3>50 Cent, G-Unit aim for modern rap relevance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Shot by Todd Plitt for USA TODAY.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NEW YORK - Older, sharper, and closer-knit than ever, the G-Unit crew is back in beast mode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a surprise move last August, 50 Cent's veteran rap group released EP The Beauty of Independence, its first new effort since 2008's T.O.S. (Terminate on Sight).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Although it got off to a weak start - bowing at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>17 on the Billboard 200 album chart and moving just 14,000 copies its first week, according to Nielsen SoundScan - Beauty marked a long-awaited return to the game for the formidable hip-hop collective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>G-Unit's 2003 debut Beg for Mercy has sold more than 3 million copies to date (not to mention the platinum solo efforts of members 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Another six-track EP, The Beast is G-Unit, was released Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It's the product of mere weeks in the studio last summer, when G-Unit recorded more than 40 songs together after reuniting for a performance at Summer Jam hip-hop fest in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It wasn't planned. It was very organic," says 50 (real name: Curtis Jackson), sitting in his office at label G-Unit Records in the heart of Times Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It felt like there was so much coverage from hip-hop blogs and (publications), people that covered the culture gravitated toward it immediately."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Fans' excitement over seeing them back together (with the addition of new member Kidd Kidd) was understandable, given the Unit's bumpy road in the spotlight - beginning with Yayo's incarceration on gun-possession charges while recording Mercy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Rapper The Game came into the group in 2004, only to have a public falling-out with mentor 50 shortly after.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Similarly, Banks and Buck each had their share of misunderstandings with 50, stemming from creative differences and, as Buck puts it, "having a lot of money at a fast time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Once we got back together and laid everything out on the table, I think we realized we never had a beef amongst each other," Buck continues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"What you've seen play out with G-Unit in the past, I don't think you'll ever see again. We're older now, and some of the things that we did back then we just don't do now, because it's not in our nature."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It helps that "I've learned to stop myself from saying things I don't mean," 50 says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We've had enough time around each other where we can identify the defects of character, so we can make sure we don't experience the same thing again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But now that they've returned, where exactly do gangsta rappers like 50 and G-Unit fit into the current landscape of hip-hop?</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After all, artists that sell more than a million records are increasingly scarce - let alone an entire group that can manage that feat, as G-Unit once did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And while genre titans such as Nicki Minaj and Drake can still be counted on for sizable sales and singles, the urban charts tend to be dominated by up-and-comers that incorporate themes of violence and drug use into their songs, but whose sound wouldn't necessarily be classified as gangsta rap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>With albums Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003) and The Massacre (2005), 50 handily scored No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>1 songs on Billboard's Hot 100, such as In Da Club and Candy Shop, but he hasn't hit the chart's top 20 since Ayo Technology with Justin Timberlake in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>And though his solo album Animal Ambition debuted at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>4 with 47,000 copies last summer, it failed to score any crossover hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>After artists such as N.W.A, 2Pac, Notorious B.I.G. and Snoop Dogg ushered gangsta rap into the mainstream in the late '80s and '90s, "50 Cent came around when it was sort of peaking, and he had the formula to capitalize on that by making these records that were lyrically unimpressive in some ways, (but) they still were commercially very impressive," says Erik Nielson, an assistant professor at the University of Richmond who teaches classes in hip-hop culture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I think that's what 50 Cent did better than anybody during his run."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>And although he may be better known lately for his business acumen - creating audio company SMS Audio, partnering on energy-drink brand SK Energy Shots, and executive producing hip-hop drama Power on Starz - 50 can stay relevant if he continues to respond to what's going on in the world today, as G-Unit did with their Ahhh (Expletive) video last summer, a response to Ferguson, Mo., and police brutality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"It kind of shows you they're aware of what's going on, but I think they need to also try different producers and find a way to speak on what's been happening as the men that they are, and not the men that they used to be, in order to survive in this game," says Billboard.com associate editor Erika Ramirez, who heads the site's R&B/hip-hop column, The Juice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Kendrick Lamar and Drake and Kanye, the reason that they're on top is that they talk about what's going on in their lives at this moment, and they're also innovative as far as their sound goes. So I think that's something they need to explore in order to be in the same realm as those that are on top right now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But you don't have to tell G-Unit to keep up with the times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>While some artists have fussed over rap seemingly losing its authenticity with the popularity of white, "hip-pop" acts such as Iggy Azalea and Macklemore and Ryan Lewis in recent years, G-Unit believes the genre is supposed to evolve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I just think it's stupid say what's hip-hop or not," Banks says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"You know what I'd ask them, the same (people) who critique and criticize? 'If Iggy sent you a record, would you work with her?' Because if Iggy sent me a record, I'm doing it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"You can't stay in the cookie-cutter mentality, doing the same thing you used to do when things are dramatically changing around you," 50 says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"You've got a guy who says he's been in the music business for 20 years? Listen carefully to what they say after that, because he probably has no (expletive) idea what's going on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"That business was a whole different thing from what it is today."</td></tr>

<h3>Kenya burns 15 tonnes of ivory to deter elephant poachers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nairobi:Kenya has burned 15 tonnes of elephant tusks and rhino horns as part of efforts to curb poaching of the mammals in the East African country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>President Uhuru Kenyatta set ablaze the three-metre high pile on Tuesday at Nairobi National Park, where one of his predecessors took a similar step to protect the nation's wildlife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The government plans to burn the rest of its ivory stockpile later this year, Mr Kenyatta said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This shows we are committed to save our elephants and we want the world to know that ivory belongs to the elephants," Paul Udoto, spokesman for the Kenya Wildlife Service, said at the ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"No one should pretend to look more beautiful by putting on ivory".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A Kenya Wildlife Service officer next to the pile of contraband ivory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>African elephants are considered endangered, with about 470,000 left in the wild in 37 countries, according to the African Wildlife Foundation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Poaching of the animals, which is reducing their population faster than they can reproduce, is worth as much as $240million a year, according to figures from the United Nations Congress on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Poachers killed 164 elephants in Kenya last year, compared with 302 in 2013 and 384 in 2012, while 53 rhinos were killed in 2014 compared with 59 and 30 in the previous two years, according to the Kenya Wildlife Service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Kenyan government partly attributes the reduction in poaching to tougher laws enacted last year, said Paul Muya, deputy spokesman for the service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta, centre, looks on as 15 tonnes of ivory confiscated from smugglers and poachers is burnt in Nairobi National Park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Burning of contraband ivory, coupled with China stopping importing ivory for one year starting last week, will help greatly in the fight against poaching," Mr Muya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In 1989, former Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi burned 12 tonnes of ivory worth more than $1.2 million at Nairobi National Park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kenya's elephants were on the brink of extinction at the time, with the population having dropped to 16,000 from 167,000 in 1973.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The event halted the decline in their number, which currently stands at about 38,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The ivory burned by Moi was mainly from internal poaching, but today we have tusks from elephants poached internally and those confiscated while in transit through Kenya," Mr Muya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In 2009, former President Mwai Kibaki burned 5 tonnes of tusks that were traced and returned from Singapore, according to Mr Muya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Kenya may have as much as 100 tonnes of contraband ivory in its stockpiles, according to Paula Kahumba, chief executive officer of WildlifeDirect, a Nairobi-based non-governmental conservation organisation.</td></tr>
