<h3>Iraqi militia loyal to radical Shiite cleric al-Sadr joins fight for Islamic State-held Tikrit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BAGHDAD - Dozens of fighters with the militia loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr left Iraq's capital Sunday to take part in an offensive to capture Tikrit from the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Men from Iraq's Peace Brigade left to the Shiite holy city of Samarra, the launching point for operations to recapture Saddam Hussein's hometown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>About a dozen heavily armed trucks packed with fighters left Baghdad earlier Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We are traveling to help the community of Muslims and to help the people of Iraq," said Ali al-Mousawi, a spokesman for the brigade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Iraqi troops and Iranian-backed Shiite militias launched a long-awaited offensive this month aimed at retaking Tikrit, a Sunni bastion on the Tigris River whose capture would pave the way for an assault on Mosul, which U.S. officials have said could come as soon as next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tikrit and Mosul have been under the control of the Islamic State group since it swept across northern Iraq in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The extremists hold a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Iraqi officials say that at least 30,000 men - including soldiers, Shiite militiamen, Sunni tribes and police officers - are fighting to seize Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>U.S. Gen. Martin Dempsey said Wednesday that at least 20,000 militiamen are taking part in the offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Earlier this month, New York-based Human Rights Watch called on the Iraqi government to protect civilians in Tikrit and allow them to flee combat zones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Its statement noted "numerous atrocities" against Sunni civilians by pro-government militias and security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Al-Sadr, who comes from a line of influential Shiite clerics, heads the militia previously known as the Mahdi Army, a paramilitary force he formed in 2003 in a show of resistance against the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Last month, he announced that he would withdraw the Peace Brigade from fighting in a "show of goodwill" following accusations that the militias were responsible for battlefield atrocities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Al-Mousawi said the Peace Brigade are looking to fight alongside Tikrit's Sunni tribes to liberate the city, saying: "It's them who should lead this fight, since Tikrit is where their homes and families are."</td></tr>
