<h3>Ohio State suspends Bosa, Marshall, 2 others for opener (Yahoo Sports)</h3>

<tr><td>3</td><td>''Violation of team policies,'' Buckeyes coach Urban Meyer said Thursday at Big Ten media days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Meyer did say the violations had nothing to do with players breaking any laws.</td></tr>
