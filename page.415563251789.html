<h3>Producer of latest Bond film denies Mexico changed script</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The latest James Bond movie began filming in Mexico City this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - The producer of the new James Bond thriller "Spectre" denies that the script was changed to get incentives in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Earlier, the website Tax Analysts said leaked emails indicated that Mexico made suggestions on the nationality of an actress and the villain, the villain's intended victim and some film shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Implicitly, Mexico's incentives for the film were at stake, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Producer Michael G. Wilson said Wednesday: "There is nothing in the script that we hadn't had before. The villain was always an Italian ... we already shot that in Rome."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Asked about Mexico's purported insistence on a Mexican actress in a role known as "Estrella," Wilson said, "We always had a Mexican actress playing this part."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The film has cast Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman in the role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Officials in Mexico City have declined to comment on possible incentives offered on the movie, which is scheduled to begin its Mexico filming Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Relying on emails leaked as part of the recent hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Tax Analysts said that the target of the villain "Sciarra" should be an international leader rather than Mexico City's mayor and that a "special police force" should appear in the film instead of Mexican police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Wilson confirmed there are incentives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Everywhere we go we have incentives," he said at a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Sometimes they're taxes; sometimes they're other kind of incentives. You can get cooperation, you can get things you would usually pay for for free and all that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But it wasn't just incentives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Wilson confirmed that Mexico's "Day of the Dead" traditions will be seen in the film, or at least a Bond version - "where everything is sort of magnified."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mexicans remember departed relatives and friends on the Day of the Dead at the beginning of November with orange flowers, candy skulls and other death-related decorations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The writers thought the day of the death would be an excellent background in the opening sequence, very colorful, very mysterious," Wilson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"You can only do that in Mexico. There is no other place that offers that but Mexico."</td></tr>

<h3>Alastair Cook: England were WRONG to sack me</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Test skipper was ditched by the selectors last December, on the eve of what turned out to be a disastrous World Cup campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But speaking in Abu Dhabi, where he is preparing to play for the MCC against champion county Yorkshire, Cook showed that he remains raw, insisting the decision had not only hurt him but left a vacuum of "real leadership".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>England's hapless efforts Down Under saw them dumped out of the World Cup before the quarter finals, something Cook maintained would not have happened on his watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I think you saw in Australia the dangers of making such a big decision so close to the tournament," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I can only speak from watching a little bit from afar but it did look like the lads were shell-shocked from the first two games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"That's when you need real leadership to help steer you through that. Whether I would have made a difference, I don't know but you always back yourself."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cook added: "I would have loved to have had that opportunity that was taken away from me. The selectors made the decision because they thought it was best for English cricket. Hindsight probably proved them wrong."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Test captain's attack on the decision made by the selection panel - James Whitaker, Peter Moores, Angus Fraser , Mick Newell - and England managing director Paul Downton, will sting the management team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But they will also have been disappointed that it managed to overshadow the news of the 16-man squad for the West Indies, particularly given they had tried to inject fresh blood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The announcement saw call-ups for uncapped players in Durham fast bowler Mark Wood, who impressed on the Lions tour of South Africa, and Yorkshire duo Adil Rashid and Adam Lyth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There was also a widely anticipated recall for Jonathan Trott, 16 months after his exit from Test cricket with stress-related illness in Brisbane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Cook's intervention might be deemed to have undermined Moores at a crucial time with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison currently investigating what went wrong in Australia and New Zealand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the England captain insisted he was still keen to work with Moores this summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But I've really enjoyed working with Peter and in my eyes he's a fantastic coach who needs a bit of luck for that to come out," said Cook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I hope he stays and gets the opportunity to turn it round."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Neither Cook nor Whitaker have plans on welcoming Kevin Pietersen back into the England fold though with the chairman of selectors insisting the batsman was "not in our plans" and captain stating he thought a return was "very unlikely".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>As Trott returns, opener Moeen Ali will be absent after failing to convince medics he was fit to tour, a decision which led to a last minute reshuffle with Adam Lyth and James Tredwell brought in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Chris Woakes also misses out through injury with Ben Stokes taking his place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There were no seats on the plane for Sam Robson, James Taylor or Steve Finn, who tweeted that he was "gutted" not to be picked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>His place went to new boy Wood, who impressed on the recent Lions tour to South Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>England: Cook (capt), Lyth, Trott, Ballance, Root, Bell, Stokes, Buttler, Bairstow, Rashid, Plunkett, Broad, Anderson, Jordan, Wood, Tredwell.</td></tr>
