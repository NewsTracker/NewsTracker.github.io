<h3>Apple Music brings change to streaming, but is it enough?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Musician Drake, right, high fives Eddy Cue, Apple senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, Monday, June 8, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The maker of iPods and iPhones announced Apple Music, an app that combines Beats 1, a 24-hour, seven-day live radio station, with an on-demand music streaming service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When Apple launches its Apple Music streaming service at the end of June, it will affect things big and small in the music industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users in more than 100 countries will get to try the $10-per-month service for free for the next three months when it is pushed to their devices with a free upgrade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They'll get unlimited access to tens of millions of songs during the trial, and afterward be required to pay a monthly fee for access, instead of paying for each album or song download.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It'll change the way you experience music forever," CEO Tim Cook promised Monday at Apple's annual conference for software developers, held in San Francisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It could become one more thing that keeps current iPhone and iPad users inside the Apple Inc. ecosystem, while enticing others in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Here's a look at some of the major aspects of Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Subscribers will be able to ask Siri, Apple's mobile digital assistant, all sorts of unusual questions about music, and have any of millions of tunes play back in response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Executive Eddy Cue demonstrated a few of them Monday, including asking for a playlist of the top 10 hits in the alternative genre, asking for a song from the soundtrack of the movie "Selma," and even asking for the top song from May 1982.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>(It was Joan Jett & the Blackheart's "I Love Rock 'n' Roll."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Using Siri's artificial intelligence and one's voice could come in handy when working out, going on a jog or driving a car equipped with Apple's Car Play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In modern times, Internet radio has been defined by automated playlist generators like Pandora, Songza and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Apple is changing that game by bringing back living, breathing DJs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It plans to run "Beats 1," a live 24/7 radio station hosted by DJs - including former BBC host Zane Lowe - in Los Angeles, New York and London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The service will be free to users with an Apple ID.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It will also offer standard genre-based Internet radio stations, this time with playlists curated by humans, instead of the algorithms that power the soon-to-be-disappearing feature, iTunes Radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Apple is opening a new platform for artists that allows them to release to fans content such as lyrics to an upcoming song, behind-the-scenes video, or even new tracks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Any user can access "Connect" through a tab on the Apple Music app, and can follow artists and access their feeds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Only subscribers will be able to view, save and like the content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Requiring payment for what might be considered promotional content is new to subscription services, but super-fans may be drawn in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Apple device users who have bought songs or albums on iTunes needn't worry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Their music will still be on their devices, and in many cases, still saved to the cloud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Music that isn't available for streaming but still for sale on iTunes, like songs from the Beatles, can be integrated into playlists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Subscription music can be saved for offline listening alongside downloads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>And the some 300,000 subscribers to Beats Music, which Apple bought along with the headphone line for $3 billion last year, will have the opportunity to transfer their playlists over to Apple Music, at which point, their Beats subscription will be canceled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Apple touts its human curation so much, it's making you pay for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A new "For You" tab will offer subscribers music suggestions based on artists and genres they say they like, as well as what they actually listen to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A team of music experts is said to be behind every pick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>This feature is a nearly direct import from Beats Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"These people are going to help you with the most difficult question in music: What song comes next?" said Apple executive Jimmy Iovine, who helped develop the service.</td></tr>
