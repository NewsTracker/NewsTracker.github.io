<h3>Bali nine: George Brandis calls for stay on executions until legal proceedings conclude</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Attorney-General George Brandis has urged his Indonesian counterpart not to allow Bali nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to be executed before all legal hearings related to their cases have been heard in full.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran are due to be executed early Wednesday morning despite having proceedings underway in the Indonesian Constitutional Court and the Indonesian Judicial Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Attorney-General George Brandis: "These proceedings raise serious questions regarding the integrity of the two men's initial sentence and the clemency process."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, Senator Brandis revealed he made the plea directly to Indonesia's Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo in a letter on Anzac Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was the third time Senator Brandis had written to his Indonesian counterpart about Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"These proceedings raise serious questions regarding the integrity of the two men's initial sentence and the clemency process," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It is important that these actions are heard in full before any further steps are taken."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Frankly outrageous": former Australian attorney-general Philip Ruddock speaks out against the imminent executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Fairfax Media revealed on Monday that Mr Prasetyo was senior figure in the office of the Attorney-General in 2006 when it allegedly intervened to insist the Bali nine duo get the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Senator Brandis said he understood that Indonesia's Judicial Commission plans to interview the two men in relation to its investigation into bribery allegations in the original trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Furthermore, a preliminary hearing of the Constitutional Court has been scheduled for 12 May to hear the application made by the two men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Respectfully, the Australian government calls on the President and Attorney-General of Indonesia to stay the executions until the Constitutional Court and Judicial Commission proceedings are completed," Senator Brandis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It would be a terrible outcome if rulings or findings in either of these proceedings called into question executions which have already been implemented and are irrevocable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Former Australian attorney-general Philip Ruddock said it was "frankly outrageous" that Indonesia planned to proceed with the executions of Chan and Sukumaran before the Constitutional Court hears their appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"In my years as Commonwealth Attorney-General I met leading Indonesian law makers and know and share their concerns for fundamental human rights," Mr Ruddock said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The emergence of a true democracy with a commitment to the rule of law will be seriously challenged if these issues are mishandled."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Ruddock said that the issue had now moved beyond opposition to the death penalty on principle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"This is an issue about legal process and allowing a legitimate Indonesian court to carry out its role and make a decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Ending the lives of those who would likely be impacted by such a decision undermines the positive recent developments in democracy and the rule of law."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said on Tuesday that she had received a letter from Indonesia's Foreign Minister on Monday night but that it offered no hope of a reprieve for Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"They gave no indication that President [Joko] Widodo would change his mind and grant the clemency that we have sought," she said on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We have made representations across every level, across every sector of the Indonesian government and we'll continue to do so."</td></tr>
