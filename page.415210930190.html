<h3>Californian facing new charges related to attempt to travel to Syria, join Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Adam Dandach (DAN-ditch) was also charged in the superseding indictment with obstructing justice by trying to destroy records of his online activity to thwart investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dandach was stopped in July in the Orange County airport while trying to board a flight to Turkey with an expedited replacement passport he got after he said he accidentally threw his old one away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Prosecutors said he knew that wasn't true and that his mother had confiscated the passport when she heard about his plan to go overseas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The FBI said Dandach told agents he planned to pledge allegiance and offer to help the Islamic State in Syria any way he could.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He told agents he believed the killings of American soldiers were justified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>When told he could face criminal charges, Dandach said he was more disappointed about not going to Syria than about getting in trouble with the law, according to court papers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dandach, a resident of the city of Orange, is in custody and scheduled to be arraigned March 16 on the new charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He's going to plead not guilty and we're going to fight them in court," defense lawyer Pal Lengyel-Leahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The defendant, also known as Fadi Fadi Dandach, previously pleaded not guilty to lying on a passport application and using a passport secured through false statements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Prosecutors added in the new indictment that he committed those offenses to facilitate international terrorism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If convicted, Dandach could face up to 15 years in federal prison on the terrorism charge, and up to 25 years on each of the other counts, federal authorities said.</td></tr>
