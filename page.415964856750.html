<h3>Pope decries killing of Christians</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tens of thousands of pilgrims joined him for the Way of the Cross ceremony, recalling Jesus' crucifixion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Among the cross bearers were Syrian and Iraqi refugees, and Nigerians who had escaped Boko Haram persecution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The service came a day after almost 150 people were killed in an al-Shabab attack on a Kenyan university.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We still see today our persecuted brothers, decapitated and crucified for their faith in you [Jesus], before our eyes and often with our complicit silence," Pope Francis said, presiding over the ceremony at the Colosseum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Earlier, he condemned the attack in Kenya, where Christians were singled out and shot, as an act of "senseless brutality".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In another Good Friday ceremony, Pope Francis listened as the Vatican's official preacher Raniero Cantalamessa denounced the "disturbing indifference of world institutions in the face of all this killing of Christians".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He too mentioned the Kenya attack, as well as the beheading of 22 Egyptian Coptic Christians by Islamic State (IS) militants in Libya in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Pope Francis has spoken out against the persecution of Christians before, saying that the world would be justified using military force to combat the "unjust aggression" by IS.</td></tr>
