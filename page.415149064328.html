<h3>Cleveland: Boy shot by cop died because of his own actions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In court documents, the city says Tamir Rice's injuries and the subsequent complaints for damages were the result of his own actions and a failure "to exercise due care to avoid injury."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That's among 20 defenses in Cleveland's response to a federal lawsuit filed on behalf of Tamir's family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The city also says it didn't violate Tamir's federal rights and is entitled to certain legal immunities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An officer responding to a call about someone with a firearm shot the boy on Nov. 22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The family's complaint alleges excessive force, negligence and failure by police to immediately provide first aid.</td></tr>
