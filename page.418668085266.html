<tr><td>4</td><td>ZURICH (AP) - FIFA executives were meeting Monday to choose a presidential election date, with UEFA President Michel Platini gaining support to succeed Sepp Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Platini has been asked to run by the majority of FIFA's confederations but has not yet decided whether to be a candidate, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
