<h3>Greece 'agrees deal with eurozone'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece and eurozone nations have agreed a deal to extend financial aid after bailout talks in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Eurozone finance ministers reached an agreement to extend Greece's financial rescue programme by four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup, said that Athens had pledged to honour all its debts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This is a very positive outcome," he told a news conference on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In return for the extension, Greece has agreed to present an initial list of reform measures by Monday, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, said he would work night and day between now and Monday to devise the new list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Eurozone officials will then review the reforms and see if they go far enough to appease creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If finance chiefs are left unsatisfied, there is still a chance the deal will be scrapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Varoufakis added that Greece had not used threats or bluff during the talks: "The four-month period will be a time to rebuild new relations with Europe and the IMF."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, he said the deal would be "dead" if the list of Greek reforms was not agreed, reported the AFP news agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Friday's extension was sealed just days before Greece's bailout programme ends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The BBC's chief business correspondent Linda Yueh says the Greeks have won some flexibility, but their reforms must be made within set fiscal parameters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Greece and Germany have stepped back from the brink.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>And for now Greece remains in the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But there will be months of fraught negotiations before it will be clear whether the economy and finances of this recession-battered nation have been put back on a stable footing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In fact, what was agreed on Friday night guarantees there will be no fresh crisis - no fears of Greece quitting the eurozone - for a full two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Because by Monday night, the Syriza government has to submit a preliminary list of proposed economic reforms - which will form the basis of negotiations till the end of April on a new financial settlement for the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A Greek government official said Athens now had time to negotiate a "new deal".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Greece has turned a page," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We have avoided recessionary measures."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Greece had been seeking a six-month extension of the bailout but the Eurogroup opted for four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The agreement removes the immediate risk of Greece running out of money next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said: "We are pleased that work can actually begin."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>She was involved in Friday afternoon talks between Mr Varoufakis and Wolfgang Schaeuble, the German finance minister, that helped pave the way for the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The agreement helped send Wall Street to new record highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending up 154 points, or 0.9%, at 18,140.44 points, while the broader S&P 500 added 0.6% to 2,110.3 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The euro gained against the US dollar on Friday following the announcement, adding 0.3% to $1.1403.</td></tr>
