<h3>David Beckham welcomes Luis Figo's FIFA presidential bid</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>British soccer star David Beckham takes a photo with his children in the front row after the Victoria Beckham Fall 2015 collection show during Fashion Week, Sunday, Feb. 15, 2015, in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>LONDON (AP) - David Beckham waded into the FIFA presidential election on Tuesday, singling out former Real Madrid teammate Luis Figo in his bid to unseat Sepp Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 39-year-old Beckham, who retired from soccer in 2013, has largely kept his distance from the world of FIFA politics after being part of England's failed 2018 World Cup bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But on Tuesday, he issued a statement to The Associated Press that seemed to embrace Figo's candidacy for the election in May. The two played together for two seasons at Madrid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I welcome the candidacy of my friend Luis for FIFA president," Beckham said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Any successful organization needs to have good people who are passionate about the game and want to do the best for fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"FIFA will only benefit from having a wide range of strong candidates present their visions for the game and it's good to see people volunteer. I wish Luis and the other candidates well."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Figo is the only former player standing in the election, which also features FIFA vice president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein and Dutch football association chairman Michael van Praag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The 42-year-old Figo, who has little track record in football politics and was a surprise candidate ahead of last month's deadline, is due to detail his vision for FIFA at his manifesto launch on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The statement from Beckham made no reference to Blatter, who he condemned in 2011 for an "appalling" suggestion that on-the-field racism could settled by a handshake between players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 78-year-old Blatter is seeking a fifth, four-year presidential term at scandal-tainted FIFA despite vowing before his re-election in 2011 not to stand again in 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Beckham's last foray into football politics came in 2010 during the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The bidding process, which led to Russia landing the 2018 tournament and Qatar being award the 2022 event, has been subject to ethics investigations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Beckham has previously said the process left him with a "real sick feeling," believing there was "something wrong with the system."</td></tr>
