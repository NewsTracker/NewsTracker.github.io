<h3>AskHamas Twitter campaign backfires on Islamic militant group</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Islamic militant group Hamas has launched a Twitter hashtag campaign to build support in the West, but the effort seems to be backfiring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hamas, which rules Gaza, launched (hashtag)AskHamas on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The campaign promised responses from the group's leaders, or as they called it, "Truth from the mouth of the horse."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Twitter users responded with mockery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>One asked if a masked Hamas gunman was "single and ready to mingle."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Others criticized Hamas for hiding weapons and fighters in civilian areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A Twitter user whose profile identified her as an Israeli diplomat asked: "Given a choice, is it better to hide a weapons cache in a hospital's radiology or pediatrics unit?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hamas said the goal of the campaign is so the group could express its views directly to the world.</td></tr>
