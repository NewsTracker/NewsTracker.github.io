<h3>Will 'Call of Duty: Black Ops 3' Be Held Back By Xbox 360 And PS3?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Will 'Call of Duty: Black Ops 3' Be Held Back By Xbox 360 And PS3?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>We're starting to leave the Xbox 360 and PS3 behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>We had good times with those machines, but the majority of current development is taking place on current-gen consoles only and, unlike last holiday season, 2015 isn't likely to have a lot of blockbusters for those who haven't taken the plunge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But there's one major franchise that's not leaving older machines behind: Call of Duty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 has been designed to harness the full potential of the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC.," they write.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"However, we know that there are still some fans that haven't made the transition to the new console hardware, which is why we're happy to share that we're working with developers Beenox and Mercenary Technology on Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Xbox 360 and PS3 players will be able to experience Call of Duty: Black Ops 3's gameplay across campaign, multiplayer and zombies. While the teams are working to deliver the best possible experience for Xbox 360 and PS3, naturally there will be some differences across generations. For instance, the campaign mode on Xbox 360 and PS3 is currently in development with a goal of enabling two-player cooperative play, instead of the four-player cooperative campaign on next-gen. There will also be some other features and functionality built specifically for the new generation of consoles that cannot be supported on Xbox 360 and PS3. We'll be sharing more information regarding feature differences from one console generation to another later this year as launch on November 6 approaches. Also, it should be noted that there's no version of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 for Nintendo Nintendo Wii U planned."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This isn't surprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Call of Duty is one of the biggest games in the world and it has a playerbase that's less likely to have bought an Xbox One or PS4 than the average "core" gamer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>What's more, Activision has high expectations for the numbers this game will draw, and it's not likely to make those colossal sales figures on current gen alone: skipping older machines eliminates millions upon millions of potential customers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But Activision's blogpost is painfully aware of the major concern that gamers will have about this announcement: that the game will be held back by the necessity of running on Xbox 360 and PS3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And that's because it probably will be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There's no way of knowing until we actually see the game, and if anyone can minimize the impact of this decision, it's Call of Duty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But the two generations of games are going to need to have a lot of the same core systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That means there are some things that might have worked on Xbox One and PS4 that just wouldn't have on 360 and PS3, and those things will need to be cut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Which is a shame: I have a soft spot for this series, even for all the hate it gets, and I want to see some of those trademark set pieces take full advantage of new hardware.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Call of Duty is an intensely iterational game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It's hard not to be when you come out with a full-scale blockbuster every year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>So far, it's yet to have that massive technical leap that comes with a hardware shift.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Even Assassin's Creed had that with Unity, though the game left something to be desired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Maybe next year's game will make the complete transition, but if there's one franchise to hold onto those old install bases, it should be this one.</td></tr>
