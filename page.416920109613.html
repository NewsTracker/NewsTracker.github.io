<h3>Mexico May Have Right Girl to Return to Mother in Texas</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Authorities may have located a girl taken by her father from Houston to Mexico eight years ago in a cross-border custody case that exploded into international headlines recently in a case of mistaken identity, an official said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The girl presented herself at a court building accompanied by three relatives and identified herself as Alondra Diaz, a court official in the southwestern state of Michoacan told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the court was evaluating the girl's paperwork and identity documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The whereabouts of Alondra Diaz, who turns 13 this year, have been unknown since 2007, when her father allegedly took her to Mexico without her mother's consent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In April, a judge erroneously sent another girl named Alondra to be reunited with Houston resident Dorotea Garcia, who was convinced she was her long-lost daughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Video that circulated widely in social and traditional media showed Alondra Luna Nunez being taken kicking and screaming by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Days later, DNA testing in the United States proved that Alondra Luna was not Garcia's daughter, and she was returned to her family in Guanajuato, Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The girl and her family had asked for a DNA examination before she was sent to Texas, but the judge said that was not within her authority and declined to order the test.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Susana Nunez, the mother of Alondra Luna, sounded a note of caution after what she called a nightmare for her family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I hope the authorities simply make sure that this girl is truly her, that they have the right girl," Nunez told The Associated Press by phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If it turns out to be the right Alondra, she said, "I'm happy for her and her mother."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nunez said her daughter is doing well following her ordeal, returning to school and resuming the usual life of a teenager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"She has calmed down," Nunez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Associated Press writer Peter Orsi in Mexico City contributed.</td></tr>
