<h3>Father of Palestinian killed in Syria says son duped into IS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Said Musalam said IS lured his 19-year-old son Mohamed with promises of women, money and cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"They promised a lot of things and then I came here and there is nothing," Musalam recalled his son saying in a phone call home from Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The son said he was in Raqqa, the de-facto capital of the Islamic State group, and had heard his mother was sick and wanted to come back, the father added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The father spoke to The Associated Press from the family's east Jerusalem home, a day after IS released a video purporting to show the killing of a captive identified as Mohamed Said Ismail Musalam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the 13-minute video posted online, a militant and a boy dressed in camouflage stand behind a man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The fighter makes a brief statement in French accusing the man of working for the Mossad before the boy steps forward and shoots the captive in the head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The AP could not independently verify the video but it was released by the IS group's Furqan media arm and corresponds to previous IS videos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Israeli Foreign Ministry declined comment while Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency said it announced earlier this year that Mohamed Musalam had left for Turkey to fight with IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The elder Musalam said he was the only one in the family to watch the video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said he saw his son dressed in orange, knew that he was marked for death, and could not watch it through to the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>His wife cried and she and other family members were too distraught to watch, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The family said it had begun a customary three-day mourning period, though there will not be a mourning tent because they live in a Jewish area of east Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Musalam said he wished the same fate upon the family of Islamic State group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I will leave it to God and what happened to my son Mohamed I hope God will do the same for you, your sons and your family," Musalam said in Arabic, addressing al-Baghdadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"God knows that one day we'll meet, whether in paradise or in hell, and we'll settle the accounts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>After the video was released on Tuesday, Musalam told the AP that his son left for Syria four months ago without telling his family and later told his brother that he was going to fight with IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>More than a month ago, the family received a call from an unidentified person who said Musalam had fled IS, was caught at a Turkish checkpoint, and was put in IS jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"They did not want to let him leave because if he comes back, he might be caught by the Israelis and tell them what he had seen. So they wanted to get rid of him," the father said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I know my son. I raised him well. I am sure he's not working for the Mossad."</td></tr>

<h3>NATO chief says Russia still equipping Ukraine rebels</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Asked at a news conference about a U.S. diplomat's remark that Russian tanks had crossed into Ukraine in recent days, he declined specific comment but said: "We ... still see Russian presence and strong support for the separatists in eastern Ukraine. We see the delivery of equipment, forces, training. And so Russia is still in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Therefore we call on Russia to withdraw all its forces from eastern Ukraine and to respect the Minsk agreement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On Tuesday, senior State Department official Victoria Nuland told a U.S. congressional hearing that Russian tanks and artillery had crossed into eastern Ukraine in recent days in breach of a ceasefire deal agreed in Minsk on Feb. 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Stoltenberg and the top NATO commander, U.S. General Philip Breedlove, told reporters at the alliance's military headquarters in Belgium that their priority now in Ukraine was to see monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) given the safe and free access and comprehensive information they needed to reinforce the truce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Breedlove said NATO could not say if numbers of combatants and weaponry had changed from estimates before the ceasefire because of the difficulties of monitoring movements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was positive that men and equipment had moved back from frontlines, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"But we're not sure where they've been moved."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ukraine's government says rebels have been concentrating armaments in depots near the main eastern city of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Stoltenberg said he was concerned that weaponry which was not being monitored could be repositioned for future combat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Our main message today is that the OSCE needs access," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"What we ask for is both freedom of movement ... but also that they get access to necessary information ... The monitoring of ceasefire is by no means sufficient today."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Stoltenberg said that despite reports of Ukrainian interest in an international peacekeeping force in the east, no request had been made to NATO and he would not speculate on the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said NATO was "on track" with implementing a plan agreed last September in response to perceived Russian threats to set up a new rapid-reaction force of 5,000 rotating troops backed up by support units in six eastern member states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The alliance is also planning its biggest military exercise in years, involving 25,000 troops, in October and November, although NATO officers said planning had begun before the crisis in Ukraine and it was not specifically aimed at responding to possible Russian action against any of its 28 members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"These measures are defensive, proportionate and in line with our international commitments," Stoltenberg said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"NATO continues to defend all allies against any threats."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some in the small, ex-Soviet Baltic states have voiced concern that the alliance might hesitate to respond to a Russian incursion on their territory or would struggle to challenge a limited Russian move far from NATO's main bases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Among exercises planned, are a beach landing on the Polish Baltic coast in June.</td></tr>
