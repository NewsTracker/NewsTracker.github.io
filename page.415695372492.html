<h3>Nusra Front quietly rises in Syria as Islamic State targeted</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But while the Islamic State group gets most of the attention largely because its penchant for gruesome propaganda, the Nusra Front quietly has become one of the key players in the four-year civil war, compromising other rebel groups the West may try to work with while increasingly enforcing its own brutal version of Islamic law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Its scope of influence now abuts the Golan Heights bordering Israel, and its membership largely composed of Syrian nationals refuse any negotiations with the government of embattled President Bashar Assad, further complicating the brutal conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The Nusra Front will most likely outlast ISIS in Syria, and will represent a severe and existential threat to the aspirations of the Syrian people in terms of a pluralistic, democratic society," said Fawaz A. Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics, using an alternate acronym for the extremist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Islamic State group helped create the Nusra Front, providing financing, manpower and military hardware in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the group and its patron eventually had a falling out in 2013 for ideological as well as strategic reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Nusra Front, while loyal to al-Qaida, has cooperated with other Syrian rebel factions in the fight to oust Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In recent months, the group has overrun rebel strongholds in Syria's Idlib province, trouncing two prominent, U.S.-backed rebel factions, Harakat Hazm and the Syria Revolutionaries Front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Following the deadly clashes, SRF leader Jamal Maarouf fled to Turkey and Hazm announced it was dissolving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Middle East-based Western diplomat said the Nusra Front began its attacks on moderate, U.S.-backed rebel factions after the American-led coalition began airstrikes in September targeting both the Islamic State group and the Khorasan group, which Washington says is a special cell within Nusra plotting attacks against Western interests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>U.S. officials last week said airstrikes have hit as many as 17 separate targets connected to the Khorasan group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Nusra Front responded with a series of spectacular attacks targeting moderate rebel groups and forces loyal to Assad in northwestern Syria, the diplomat said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It "has now created coherent control of a strategic area between Idlib and Hama (provinces) in northwestern and central Syria," said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to brief journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At the same time, the group has become increasingly aggressive toward local populations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In January, members of the group reportedly shot a woman dead in front of a crowd in Idlib after they accused her of being a prostitute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The group also has carried out public lashings, crucifixions and kidnappings - though it has not publicized the atrocities like the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Activists in southern Syria say the Nusra Front was behind the January bombing that destroyed the shrine of a 13th century Muslim scholar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Nusra Front issued a statement denying it was involved but activists say its members were seen placing the bombs.</td></tr>
