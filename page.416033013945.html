<h3>Presidential hopeful Prince Ali demands FIFA changes</h3>

<tr><td>5</td><td>He also delivered a harsh warning on the future should Swiss Blatter be voted into power for a fifth term, as is expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"You cannot underestimate how important it is ... to have a change right now," the FIFA vioe-president told Reuters in an interview on the eve of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Congress in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I will not continue on the executive committee if I am not elected because I cannot see another four years for myself if things don't change. If I win ... I'll make the changes that are so needed," said the Jordanian FA chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"My manifesto is based on my experience as president of a national association and what I have also seen serving on the FIFA executive committee over the last four years. It's also based on my discussions with other countries."</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>Prince Ali said FIFA's vast profits must be ploughed back into the development of the sport across the globe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"My ideas are based on the needs and necessities of countries the world over, from those small in size to those at the top of the game, and taking all their perspectives into account," he added.</td></tr>
