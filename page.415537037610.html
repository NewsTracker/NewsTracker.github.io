<h3>AP ANALYSIS: Advantage Netanyahu in close race</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>To govern, his Likud Party would need to depend on ultranationalists - a recipe for neither stability nor bold moves toward Mideast peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A period of some horsetrading looms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With Likud as well as rightist and religious allies, Netanyahu still only commands 57 out of 120 parliament seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He must woo Moshe Kahlon, a relative newcomer to the big leagues of Israeli politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Breaking away from Netanyahu's nationalist Likud two years ago after a falling out with the premier, he adopted a vaguely centrist platform and flirted with Isaac Herzog's more moderate Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If he is non-aligned as he claims, then he holds the balance of power between Israel's traditional right and left blocs, each with just under half of parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It is widely thought that it would be too awkward for the former Likud figure to crown the opposition unless Herzog's party enjoyed a cushion of several seats over Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Polls had suggested that would happen, but the actual vote count on Wednesday showed the opposite: Likud was ahead by 30-24 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If Kahlon does go with Netanyahu, it would give the hard-liner a fourth term that, if completed, would make him Israel's longest-serving leader, on par with the nation's founder David Ben Gurion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That would not bode well for prospects of peace with the Palestinians or a rapprochement between Israel and the region, which seems tantalizingly close in an era in which many of the neighboring Arab nations fear jihadi extremism far more than they oppose Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Under Netanyahu, Israel has deepened its hold on the West Bank, adding Jewish settlers to the point where the territory may soon become inseparable from Israel proper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Combined with the Jews in occupied and annexed east Jerusalem, there are some 600,000 Jews living on occupied land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In recent days, Netanyahu has said that he would not allow the creation of a Palestinian state if elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Palestinians have already said they would take their case against Israel to war crimes tribunals and other international bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A campaign to boycott Israel seems poised to gain traction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Netanyahu's relations with the U.S. administration of President Barack Obama are frosty at best.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>International isolation looms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Netanyahu knows the complications of all this and may try to draw in Herzog, to give his government a more moderate character.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But he has promised, in his final appeals to his base, not to do this - and Herzog would probably demand a rotation in the premier's post as his price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kahlon seems to dislike Netanyahu intensely, and he certainly has the power to crown Herzog, a mild-mannered lawyer and scion of a venerable family of Zionist founders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Kahlon's platform is moderate, as are top lieutenants in his party, and despite his Likud roots he has supported the idea of peace talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It is not inconceivable that the left's desire to unseat Netanyahu extends to offering Kahlon a rotation as prime minister.</td></tr>
