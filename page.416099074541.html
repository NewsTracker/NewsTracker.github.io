<h3>Greece expected to repay IMF loan instalment due Thursday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece - Greece is expected to meet a deadline Thursday to repay a roughly 450-million-euro ($485-million) loan instalment to the International Monetary Fund - a debt Athens has insisted it will honor despite being severely cash-strapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The debt stems from Greece's international bailout, under which the country was extended 240 billion euros in rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF to prevent bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece's new left wing-led government has been locked in strained negotiations with creditors since winning January elections on pledges to abolish the deeply resented austerity measures on which the rescue was conditional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It hopes to persuade creditors to unlock the final 7.2 billion bailout installment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Doubts about whether Athens could repay the loan had renewed fears the country might default and have to leave the eurozone.</td></tr>
