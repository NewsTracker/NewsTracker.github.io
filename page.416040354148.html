<h3>Iraqi mass graves found in Tikrit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The sites are near the former US Army base, Camp Speicher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Iraqi forensic teams have begun to excavate 12 graves following the city's recent liberation from IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The June 2014 incident is notorious after IS posted videos and pictures of the execution of the mostly Shia soldiers on social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Survivors say the militants questioned the victims to identity those who were Shia before killing them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The exhumations have began just days after Tikrit fell to a combination of the Iraqi army and Shia militias following a month long siege.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>DNA testing will be used to identify the bodies once they have been exhumed, as many families have never had confirmation of their relatives' death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We dug up the first mass grave site today. Until now we found at least 20 bodies. Initial indications show indisputably that they were from the Speicher victims," Khalid al-Atbi told the Reuters news agency on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It was a heartbreaking scene. We couldn't prevent ourselves from breaking down in tears. What savage barbarian could kill 1,700 persons in cold blood?" he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The murder of the soldiers has become a lightening rod for Shia militias who have vowed to avenge the killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The militias have been credited with halting Islamic State's advance last year, but have themselves been accused of war crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some of the burial sites are in the presidential compound of the former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, which became the IS headquarters after they took the city last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The offensive launched on 2 March to take back Tikrit involved some 30,000 fighters, two-thirds of them from the Popular Mobilisation (Hasid Shaabi) - a force comprising dozens of Iranian-backed Shia militia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Iraqi army is now expected to turn its attention to Mosul, 225km (335 miles) north along the Tigris river.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>IS's most significant stronghold in Iraq, Mosul, presents a far greater challenge than Tikrit for the US-led air coalition and Iraqi ground forces.</td></tr>
