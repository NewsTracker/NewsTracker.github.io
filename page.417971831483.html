<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Another meeting, and again a lack of clear Greek proposals, German Finance Wolgang Schaeuble groused Monday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>"If you are going to Greece on vacation, please keep checking the situation there, because it will be very dynamic," said Kopacz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Please, do not count only on your ATM cards and on ATM machines, but take a larger amount of cash with you," she added.</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>The official, who spoke Monday only on condition of anonymity as the ECB had not made the decision public, declined to provide the amount.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The credit helps support Greek banks, from which worried savers have been pulling money out ahead of a critical European summit on Monday on how to keep the country solvent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Figures have not been officially released, but reports suggest Greeks withdrew about 4 billion euros last week.</td></tr>
