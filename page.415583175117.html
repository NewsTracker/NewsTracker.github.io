<h3>Rushing to a train? This app will tell you if you're going to make it</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A look at Yo!Train, the winner of a $10,000 prize in a contest to build NYC transit apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Rushing to the Bergen Street subway station during a snowstorm a few months back, Brooklyn tech developer Duong Nguyen almost fell into the street as he checked his phone for train times and frantically considered a surface alternative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He muttered the common refrain: "There has to be a better way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nguyen channeled that frustration into an invention, a mobile app called YoTrain!, which will alert users within about 200 feet of a subway station when the next train is coming - by voice and text alert, eliminating the need to navigate the phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Today, Nguyn's invention won a $10,000 grand prize in the MTA and AT&T's App Quest Challenge, an annual contest to build new commuter tools using city data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nguyen won in a category designated for apps that mean to help transit users with disabilities, but thinks there's a broad market for his tool.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Having it all hands free and have it spoken to you makes everyone's lives a little bit better," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Now in its third year, the MTA and AT&T app challenge is meant to find creative ways to use the transit system's publicly available system data to make lives easier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The new apps, mostly still in beta testing and not yet available for public download, come just days after we were reminded of our especially painful commutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Nguyen encountered difficulties in testing their app - highly ironic challenges that underscore the evolving, patchwork nature of Internet connectivity in the subway system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some stations and lines enjoy excellent WiFi and cellular signals and real-time train arrival data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Others are still digital black holes, like Nguyen's home station, Bergen Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>YoTrain!'s full features don't work without real-time arrival data the MTA has on the numbered lines and the L line.</td></tr>

<h3>Yahoo shutting down China office in latest cost-cutting move</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Beijing operation's responsibilities will be shifted to other Yahoo Inc. offices, according to a company statement released late Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yahoo didn't specify how many people will lose their jobs in China, but pledged to treat all the workers "with respect and fairness."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The closure will mark Yahoo's exit from China, where the Sunnyvale, California, company has been winding down since turning over its operations to Alibaba Group in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That $1 billion deal gave Yahoo a lucrative stake in Alibaba that is currently worth $33 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Yahoo is preparing to spin off its Alibaba holdings into a separately traded company later this year, removing an asset that deflected attention from the challenges facing Yahoo's own businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Yahoo hired Mayer in July 2012 to engineer a turnaround, but so far she hasn't been able to boost the company's revenue even though advertisers have been shifting more of their spending to the Internet and mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Yahoo's revenue declined by 1 percent to $4.6 billion last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>New York hedge fund Starboard Value, an activist investor that owns a 0.8 percent stake in Yahoo, is among the shareholders who believe Mayer needs to trim expenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In an open letter released earlier this month, Starboard Value Managing Member Jeffrey Smith urged Mayer to cut costs by about $450 million annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Smith is also among the Yahoo shareholders who called upon Mayer to spin off the Alibaba stake to avoid triggering a huge tax bill from sale of the stake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a January conference call, Mayer emphasized that Yahoo's payroll has remained roughly the same size since she arrived, even though the company had inherited more than 1,000 employees through acquisitions completed during her reign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She also pointed out that Yahoo had closed about a dozen offices while phasing out about 75 products during her tenure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We will continue to seek and execute on efficiencies that we find on an ongoing basis as an effort to better align our resources with our strategy and growth opportunities," Mayer pledged.</td></tr>
