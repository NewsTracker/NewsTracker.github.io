<h3>Fifteen-minute Ebola test approved</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It should allow patients to be identified, isolated and cared for as quickly as possible in an attempt to bring an end to the outbreak that has killed more than 9,300 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It is less accurate than conventional tests, but takes minutes rather than hours to get a result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The test also works without electricity so it can be used in remote regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Current Ebola testing requires a laboratory to analyse the blood for fragments of the virus's genetic material.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It can take between 12 and 24 hours to get a definitive answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test, developed by US company Corgenix, searches the blood for a different part of the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Trials in West Africa suggest it correctly identifies about 92% of people who have Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The World Health Organization said: "While less accurate, the antigen test is rapid, easy to perform and does not require electricity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It can therefore be used at lower health care facilities or in mobile units for patients in remote settings."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It added that, where possible, the results from the rapid test should be confirmed by the more precise conventional testing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There were 128 new cases of Ebola in the three affected countries - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>More than 23,250 people have been infected in the outbreak and 9,380 have died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Dr Ben Neuman, a lecturer in virology at the University of Reading, said: "The new test could help to quickly confirm outbreaks in remote areas without the need to send samples to a testing clinic and wait for results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The new test isn't about saving the lives of infected people, but it can help in the long run by making it easier and quicker to detect Ebola outbreaks."</td></tr>

<h3>Playtex unveils world's first TOP CUP contouring bra</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Makers of the 32 Contour Perfection bra say it's different - and innovative - because it features top cup padding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bra comes with thin foam cups, which promise to restore fullness in the upper cup of the breast by moulding to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This claims to help restore volume and shape to an area not usually considered in the padding of a bra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This extra padding, which is dubbed a morphologic system, moulds to the breast to help create a fuller, rounder shape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The new bra, which is available in sizes 32-42 B-E and 32-40 F, was launched on the back of research carried out by the brand, which revealed that half of women are unhappy with their assets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The study found a third of unsatisfied women have a cup size C-D, despite two thirds believing this is the 'ideal' cup size.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The study suggests that changes to the breasts with age may be at the root of women's discontent as over half (58 per cent) said they've noticed significant changes to the shape of their breasts since turning 35.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Changes concern more than six out of 10 women, with a staggering 88 per cent citing loss of fullness or increased sagginess as their main complaints.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And when asked which celebrity's assets they most admire for their fullness and rounded shape, nearly half of the women said Holly Willoughby, while only 2 per cent are in awe of Katie Price's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Nigella Lawson also featured highly on the list of breasts most admired for their fullness and rounded shape, as did Kelly Brook and Katy Perry.</td></tr>
