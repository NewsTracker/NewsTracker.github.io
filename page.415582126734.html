<h3>Tag Heuer, Intel challenge Apple with Android smartwatch</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Tag Heuer, French luxury group LVMH's (LVMH.PA) biggest watch maker, said it will launch a smartwatch later this year using Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android operating system in a venture with Intel Corp (INTC.O) to compete head-on with the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tag Heuer Chief Executive Jean-Claude Biver declined to give any details about pricing, functionality or design, but said on Thursday that it aimed to launch what would be the first Android luxury smartwatch in the fourth quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Apple Watch is due to go on sale on April 24 and will range in price from $350 to $17,000 for an 18-karat gold model.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It is the company's first major new product in five years and consumer demand for the device is being closely watched by competitors and investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The device needs an Apple iPhone to work fully, and analysts say the most likely pool of initial buyers will already have an Apple smartphone in their pockets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We believe wearable technology will take off," Michael Bell, vice president of Intel's New Devices unit, said at a news conference with Tag Heuer at the Baselworld watch and jewellery fair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Intel struck partnerships with several consumer goods companies last year to develop smart wearable products, including eyewear brand Oakley, owned by Luxottica (LUX.MI), watchmaker Fossil (FOSL.O), and U.S. fashion brand Opening Ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Tag Heuer's decision to partner with technology companies to deliver a smartwatch ... will likely be the first of many similar deals," Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"With Apple Watch hitting the market it's no longer viable for Swiss watchmakers to bury their heads in the sand. Now Tag Heuer has signalled its intention to enter the smartwatch market we are certain others will follow."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gucci said on Thursday that it would develop a smartband with i.am+ whose functions would include phone calls, text messages, emails and music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The unit of French luxury group Kering (PRTP.PA) gave no details of pricing or launch timing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Some luxury executives remained sceptical about smartwatches, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Marc Hayek, who heads Swatch Group (UHR.VX) watch brands Breguet, Jaquet Droz and Blancpain, joined the chorus of luxury executives alongside Hermes (HRMS.PA) and Patek Philippe who said they had no plans to launch a smartwatch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The Apple Watch is not a real watch but a consumer electronic," he told Reuters in Basel on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Hayek forecast his three brands would enjoy a similar year in terms of sales growth to 2014, although trading in Hong Kong, one of his biggest markets, remained difficult.</td></tr>

<h3>Thousands gather at Salva Kiir rally in South Sudan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Addressing thousands gathered in the capital city Juba, Kiir emphasised that he will not be forced into a premature peace deal and rejected the UN threat of sanctions against his country, which he said would further hammer the crumbling economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"When I left [for the peace talks] some people thought that I would be forced to sign a bad agreement," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"But that signing was to be done by someone who wants things done quickly in that way, I came to you without peace."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The president declared that even if he were to sign a deal with his rival and former Vice President Riek Machar, it would do little to improve the economic situation in the country in the short term given that oil revenue in South Sudan - it's primary resource - is now almost non-existent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Therefore, he said: "We need to look at what we can do for ourselves - our land, this very fertile land. As long as there is rain in South Sudan we can make use of that land and forgetting about anything being brought in from [the] outside."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I am disappointed in the mobilisation to impose sanctions rather than encourage peace. Sanctions at this time will not only devastate the economy but increase pressures on the people of South Sudan who are already desperate," declared Kiir.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For his part, the UN humanitarian coordinator in South Sudan, Toby Lanzer, on Tuesday expressed disappointment that peace talks between Kiir and Machar had once again collapsed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Lanzer highlighted that 2.5 million people in South Sudan are severely food insecure while 400,000 children have not attended school since the civil war broke out in December 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The situation is very grave and in the absence of peace, there is every possibility of it becoming more serious," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We need real signals from the political leadership that it is going to get better."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Thousands of people gathered at a political rally in South Sudan's capital Juba on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Heavily armed police and government forces surrounded the John Garang Mausoleum in Juba where the political rally took place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A crowd of several thousand people filled the mausoleum in Juba to witness President Salva Kirr deliver a speech titled 'Standing together for peace, coexistence and harmony'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The president declared he could not be forced into a premature peace deal with rival and former vice president Riek Machar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>President Salva Kiir also announced his disappointment at the current threat of sanctions by the UN against his country whose economy is crumbling with collapsing oil prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Members of the youth 'Red Army', loyal to the president of South Sudan, march in his support at a public rally in the capital city Juba on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Senior police officers, military commanders and generals packed the stands of the John Garang Mausoleum in Juba to witness the president's speech, his first since he returned empty-handed from collapsed peace talks in Ethiopia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of South Sudan, told his people they should turn to agriculture to support themselves in the absence of oil revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Kiir said that UN sanctions would further devastate South Sudan's crumbling economy and wreck the lives of people who have already suffered a year of civil war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Across South Sudan, 2.5 million people are severely food insecure and 400,000 children have not been in formal schooling for over a year according to the UN.</td></tr>
