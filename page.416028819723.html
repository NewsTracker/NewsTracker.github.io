<h3>Edward Snowden Teaches John Oliver How the Government Can Get Your ‘Di*k Pic’ (Video)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Brian Williams got the first interview with NSA-leaker Edward Snowden-John Oliver conducted the second, and perhaps tougher interview, Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"All I'm saying is a 10-hour flight for an empty chair-I'm going to lose my shit," Oliver joked as he waited for Snowden to show up for the interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Snowden said he missed America, his family, and hot pockets (the latter provoked by an Oliver question).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The interview got more serious when Oliver asked Snowden why he did what he did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Snowden said the NSA has a role to play, but the problem is they are using their surveillance capabilities to make us "vulnerable to them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Snowden also taught Oliver about the government's ability to find people's "dick pics."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The good news is that there's no program named the 'dick pic' program. The bad news& they are still collecting everybody's information, including your dick pics," Snowden giggled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Oliver pressed Snowden about whether turning over so many documents at once was the responsible thing to do: Snowden said he read all the documents he turned over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I do understand what I turned over," Snowden said, saying the journalists are now using "extraordinary security measures" to handle the documents and reporting responsibly.</td></tr>
