<h3>Tunisia: Gunman known to intelligence ahead of attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TUNIS, Tunisia: One of the two gunmen who killed 19 tourists and others at a prominent Tunisian museum was known to intelligence services, Tunisia's prime minister said on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But no formal links to a particular terrorist group have been established in an attack that threatens the country's fledgling democracy and struggling tourism industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Razor wire ringed the National Bardo Museum on Thursday and security forces guarded major thoroughfares, while authorities hunted for two or three more people believed to have been involved in Wednesday's attack, the worst in years targeting a tourist site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It also spelled new trouble for the tourism industry, which brings throngs of foreigners every year to Tunisia's Mediterranean beaches, desert oases and Roman ruins - and had just started to recover after years of slump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Two cruise ships whose passengers had been among the victims left the port of Tunis early Thursday.</td></tr>
