<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Yahoo's Frankfurt-listed shares (YHOO.F) were up 1.1 percent, while Facebook's Frankfurt-listed stock (FB2A.F) rose 1.3 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>By contrast, Google's shares in the German market (GOOGa.F) edged 0.1 percent lower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The European Union will accuse Google Inc on Wednesday of abusing its dominant position in Internet searches, opening the U.S. tech company up to a risk of massive fines and enforced changes in its business model, reported the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that a formal antitrust charge sheet will not be ready for Wednesday and could take several more months to draw up.</td></tr>
