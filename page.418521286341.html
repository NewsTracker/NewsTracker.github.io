<h3>Google removes Chinese name for disputed South China Sea reef Scarborough Shoals</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google has altered its map of a disputed reef in the South China Sea, removing its Chinese name in favour of its internationally recognised moniker following complaints from people living in the Philippines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google Maps now refers to the reef, which is claimed by both countries, solely as Scarborough Shoal, rather than also naming it as part of the Zhongsha Islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It comes after hundreds of Filipinos signed a petition calling on Google to remove the Chinese name, claiming China's territorial claim is illegal and "a territory grab that peace loving nations should stand against".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Google appears to have made the change this week after the petition was launched on Change.org on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The tiny triangle-shaped shoal, which has a perimeter of 29 miles, was the subject of a stand-off between boats from China and the Philippines lasting several weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Philippines, which refers to the reef as Panatag Shoal, has filed a case against China, which refers to it as Huangyan Island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Beijing is not obliged to abide by its rulings and has refused to take part in a hearing at the Permanent Court of Arbitration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The rich fishing area is around 500 miles south of China, and 100 miles west of the Philippines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>China claims ownership of large parts of the South China Sea and is also in territorial disputes with with Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said that China "will never accept the unilateral attempts to turn to a third party to solve the disputes", and urged the Philippines to negotiate with China directly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A spokeswoman for Google said: "We try to keep our place names as up-to-date and as relevant as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The BBC quoted a separate Google statement which said: "We understand that geographic names can raise deep emotions which is why we worked quickly once this was brought to our attention."</td></tr>
