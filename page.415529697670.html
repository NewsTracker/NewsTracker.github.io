<h3>Study Questions Accuracy of Many Breast Cancer Biopsies</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The pathologists did well at identifying invasive breast cancer, but they struggled with spotting whether abnormal cells in a tissue sample might increase a woman's future cancer risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This may mean that some women are being treated too aggressively, the researchers noted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Overall, individual pathologists peering at breast cells through a microscope disagreed about 25 percent of the time with an expert pathology panel's interpretation of the same glass slides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>These bad calls could have serious consequences for some of the 1.6 million American women who undergo a breast biopsy each year, the researchers added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The accurate diagnosis of cancer hinges on pathologists' microscopic examination of tissue samples from patients, explained study author Dr. Joann Elmore, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Women with a wrongly interpreted biopsy might undergo unnecessary surgery or radiation therapy, receive unwarranted MRIs or mammograms, or spend many anxious years fretting that they are at increased risk for cancer when they actually are not, Elmore said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In this study, pathologists displayed remarkable accuracy in diagnosing samples taken from women with invasive breast cancer, which can be fatal unless treated promptly, Elmore said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's reassuring there was near-perfect agreement on the diagnosis of invasive breast cancer," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nearly one-quarter of the breast biopsies taken annually in the United States are diagnosed as invasive breast cancer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, pathologists had trouble analyzing breast biopsies that contained abnormal or cancerous cells which increase a woman's future risk of invasive breast cancer, the study found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Individual pathologists disagreed with the expert panel in about one out of five cases of ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, Elmore said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>DCIS is early, noninvasive breast cancer, featuring cancerous cells that are present in the milk ducts but have not spread to the surrounding breast tissue, according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Women with DCIS are receiving the same kind of treatment that women with early invasive breast cancer are receiving," including mastectomy, lumpectomy and radiation therapy, Elmore said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Because women receive such intensive treatment for DCIS, it's important we get this diagnosis right."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Pathologists fared even worse diagnosing atypia, which are benign but abnormal cells that indicate an increased risk of breast cancer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Researchers found that pathologists had about a 50-50 chance of agreeing with the expert panel on a diagnosis of atypia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"On a diagnosis of atypia, the odds of pathologists being right are similar to our ability to predict heads or tails on a coin toss," Elmore said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The study is published in the March 17 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Researchers asked a panel of three internationally recognized pathologists to independently review a set of 240 breast biopsy slides and then agree on a consensus diagnosis for each case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The same slides were then sent to 115 volunteer pathologists who regularly review breast biopsies in clinical practices in eight U.S. states, to see if their diagnosis would jibe with that of the expert panel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Each pathologist reviewed 60 breast biopsy slides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The pathologists failed to catch just 4 percent of invasive breast cancer cases, compared with 13 percent of DCIS cases and 35 percent of women with atypia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>At the other extreme, pathologists misdiagnosed atypia as a more serious condition in 17 percent of cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>And completely healthy women were misdiagnosed as having either an increased risk of breast cancer or invasive breast cancer in 13 percent of cases, according to the study.</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt?s curious plan to abandon Cairo as its capital and build a new $45-billion city in the desert</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The new city would lie somewhere to Cairo's east, closer to the Red Sea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It would sprawl across some 150 square miles and potentially be home to as many as 7 million people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Projected to cost $45 billion, it was announced at a summit in the seaside resort of Sharm El-Sheikh aimed at boosting the country's flagging economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A flashy Web site outlining the proposal hails it as "the catalyst for an Egyptian renaissance" and "a momentous endeavour to build national spirit, foster consensus and provide for the country's sustainable long-term growth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cairo, Egypt's teeming capital of 18 million people, is routinely criticized for its creaking infrastructure and horrendous traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The project would help ease congestion and overpopulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The proposed new city - which has no name yet - would be built in partnership with a prominent private developer from the United Arab Emirates and supposedly would take only five to seven years to complete, according to Egyptian Housing Minister Mostafa Madbouly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The economic summit where the project was announced attracted some $12 billion in investment pledges from an array of wealthy Gulf states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It's all in keeping with the mantra of Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, the former army man who came to power in a 2013 coup, ruthlessly quashed the country's Islamists, and has since entrenched his rule through the ballot box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sissi has insisted the priority for Egypt is economic uplift, and he invokes the imperative of guaranteeing stability when dismissing criticism of the country's shocking human rights record during his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We have been making sure Egypt is attractive to investment through ensuring stability. This is of the utmost importance," he said last week in an interview with The Washington Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Just give us a chance to develop."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Unsurprisingly, some Egyptians aren't that impressed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We, Cairenes and Egyptians, were not informed, let alone consulted about this move," writes historian Khaled Fahmy, in a Facebook post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said the vast amounts of money lavished on this new project ought, instead, be used to "improve the living standards of millions of Cairenes and of Egyptians who, at best, are dealt with as second-class citizens in their own country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The impulse for a leader to create a new capital is as old as history itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Nothing is more symbolic of the centralizing authority of a new regime than a shining edifice, built in its supposed image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That's why an array of countries in the mid-20th century - from Brazil to Nigeria to Pakistan - constructed new capitals from scratch, eager to replace legacies of division or colonial rule with soaring modernist visions of unity and the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In 1999, Malaysia shifted its capital from Kuala Lumpur to the planned city of Putrajaya, some 25 kilometers to the south, in a bid to ease overcrowding and congestion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>More curiously, in 2005, the Burmese junta quit the capital at Yangon, a former British colonial center, for Naypyidaw, a new city built literally out of the jungle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>To this day, the capital is widely described as an artificial "ghost town."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The world, of course, is littered with the ruins of forgotten capitals, abandoned after the facts on the ground outweighed the dreams of their architects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Cairo itself is an amalgamation of old and older cities, built by various rulers eager to leave their marks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>And there's no guarantee this latest project will be anything close to a success, as the Guardian reports: "The scale is huge, and there are questions like: how are you going to do the infrastructure? How are you going to get the water? How will they move all these ministries?" asks Cairo urban-planning expert David Sims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"In other words, I think it's just desperation. It will be interesting to see if anything comes of it, but I rather doubt it."</td></tr>
