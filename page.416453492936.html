<h3>Kenya kicks out top anti-corruption officials</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kenya's top anti-corruption officials were suspended Thursday following a bitter stand-off with parliament and after they alleged widespread graft in the east African nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>President Uhuru Kenyatta removed the chairman and deputy chairwoman of Kenya's Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) after MPs voted to sanction the pair, accusing them of incompetence and abuse of office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The crisis in the fight against graft comes less than a month after dozens of top Kenyan politicians and civil servants were named in an EACC report that gave a damning indictment of the scale of corruption in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A total of 175 people were named in the EACC report, including five cabinet ministers, 13 governors and a host of civil servants, MPs and members of the judiciary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>President Kenyatta had also ordered those named in the report to step aside while they are under investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Presidential spokesman Manoah Esipisu said that even though the EACC bosses had now also been suspended, he insisted that this "in no way hinders the work" of the anti-corruption body.</td></tr>
