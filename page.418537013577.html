<h3>Dos Santos to return for Mexico in Gold Cup</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Mexico will recall the barely used Giovani Dos Santos for their key Gold Cup match against Trinidad and Tobago, coach Miguel Herrera said on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Mexicans will qualify for the quarter-final stage if they win or draw Wednesday's match but face a tough test against the Caribbean side who have won both their games and are already through to the knockout phase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Herrera's side could only draw 0-0 with Guatemala on Sunday where Dos Santos played only the last few minutes of the match, but Herrera said the Villareal striker would return to the side and take his place in a new 5-3-2 formation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I expect to have some changes for this game, we are going to try something different," Herrera told reporters.</td></tr>
