<h3>Week in Tech: Week in Tech: Laser eyes, Apple's home invasion, and a new era for Spotify</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>You know how the air feels when a thunderstorm is coming?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This week's a bit like that, but we're expecting things with Lightning connectors instead of lightning bolts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple's about to unveil plans to control your home, car, wrist and the odd computer too, Spotify's getting into TV, Netflix is getting a new look and LG's covered things in cows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple's coming for your house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's been using an app called Home to control HomeKit-based devices, and that app could be part of the imminent iOS 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>We're just weeks away from Apple's developer conference, WWDC, and we're expecting to see new versions of OS X and iOS - versions that might use the San Francisco font from the Apple Watch for their default system font.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>We're expecting to see Apple TV (the box, not the much rumoured, quite unlikely and thoroughly canned TV set) as a HomeKit hub, an earlier-than-usual iPhone 6S launch and probably nothing about the Apple Car we know Tim Cook's working on in his garage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>You'll never guess who thinks the Apple Watch is "spectacular".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>No, not Jony Ive: Eric Migicovsky, CEO of Pebble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He's quite happy to see the big guns of tech move into the smartwatch space, because Pebble's offering is different: "We're focused on keeping it simple, affordable and useful."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Meanwhile Apple addressed some of the initial flaws in Watch OS 1.0 by releasing - yes!</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>- Watch OS 1.0.1, but rumoured features such as Find My Watch and enhanced Apple TV controls won't appear this side of WWDC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Netflix interface is getting a big makeover, with the Web version getting it first and the many other Netflix-powered apps and devices getting it in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's faster, looks better, makes it easier to find information and generally makes it simpler to find the best Netflix TV shows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Good news for anybody who's always fancied blasting lasers from their eyes: the FOVE eye-tracking VR headset is coming to market, hopefully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Rumours of Microsoft interest didn't turn into anything concrete, so it's off to Kickstarter for a crowdfunding campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Eye-tracking isn't just a gimmick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It solves one of the biggest problems with VR, which is that you can't always focus on what you want to look at.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>By tracking your eye movements FOVE can tell where your pupils are pointing and adjust the display accordingly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>If you fancy joining the Kickstarter it's $349 ( 225/AU$440).</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Big changes are afoot in the world of streaming: Spotify is getting a brand new version that includes not just music, but podcasts and even video content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It's also getting a running tool that will choose music according to how fast you're going, and which will turn up in Nike's Nike+ app later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Deezer's getting into podcasts too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Thanks to last year's acquisition of Stitcher, Deezer now offers more than 20,000 different podcasts and radio shows on the web and in its apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It hopes to be a one-stop shop for everything aural, with freemium and premium services to take on Spotify, Tidal and Apple's Beats Music relaunch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mobile versions of Windows suffer from the app gap, with rivals Android and iOS packing thousands more apps into their respective app stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Is the gap closing?</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>David Nield says yes, but also no.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>While the big hitters are largely there, "to buy a Windows Phone is to shut yourself out from most of the interesting, newer apps appearing on the scene as well as pretty much everything Google makes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Does the LG G4 offer anything new other than a leather case?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>We pitted the LG G4 against the LG G3 to find out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The leather isn't as nice as it looks in photos - it is "too thinly stretched over the back of the phone" - and the new processor is quad-core rather than octa-core like some other firms' flagships, but "it is indeed a more accomplished smartphone" and "has fixed some of the biggest issues with LG's last handset".</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>That said, the G3 will be around for a while yet, and it'll cost a lot less.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Our in-depth LG G4 review can help you decide whether you'd be better off with the outgoing model, or if the G4 will make you grin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Did Apple just leak the iPhone 6C?</td></tr>
