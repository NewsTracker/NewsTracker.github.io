<h3>AP sources: James, Cavaliers agree to 2-year contract (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CLEVELAND, OH - JUNE 16: LeBron James #23 of the Cleveland Cavaliers reacts against the Golden State Warriors during Game Six of the 2015 NBA Finals at Quicken Loans Arena on June 16, 2015 in Cleveland, Ohio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CLEVELAND (AP) -- There was no need for a heartfelt letter this summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>LeBron James isn't going anywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Just shy of the one-year anniversary of his celebrated homecoming, James agreed to terms on a two-year, $47 million contract, two people familiar with the negotiations told the Associated Press on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The deal includes a $24 million player option for 2016-17, said the people who spoke on condition of anonymity because James has not yet signed the contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That will be done soon enough as the four-time MVP has a busy schedule over the next few weeks to promote a new comedy film in which he portrays himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>James is hosting a VIP screening for family and friends in Akron on Friday, where he'll walk the red carpet with the other stars of ''Trainwreck,'' an R-rated movie he filmed last summer shortly after announcing he was returning to the Cavs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Unlike last July 11, when his essay in Sports Illustrated touched Cleveland fans and changed the NBA's landscape, James wasn't the star attraction during this summer's free agency period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>DeAndre Jordan and others took care of all the drama as James went on vacation in the Bahamas with close friends Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>James ended any suspense or speculation about his future with Cleveland by saying several times during the past season that he intends to end his career with the Cavs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This is the first time since 2006 that James will re-sign with a team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On two previous occasions as a free agent he left for another team, signing with Miami in 2010 and Cleveland in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It had been expected that James would wait to see if forward Tristan Thompson, who is also represented by his agent, Rich Paul, would sign before he negotiated with the Cavs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But on the first day teams could sign players, James made his intentions known to the Cavs, who in one season went from a lottery team to Eastern Conference champions with James.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>With more experienced players and perhaps a few new ones, there's no reason why the Cavs won't be in the title chase again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>James' skills have shown no signs of erosion, and owner Dan Gilbert has shown a willingness to shell out major money to keep his biggest star surrounded with quality players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And while his agreement with the Cavs is not a surprise, it does give him future flexibility and the ability to make more money next summer when the league's new TV deal kicks in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The $24 billion package is expected to escalate the salary cap by millions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The 30-year-old James led the Cavs to the NBA Finals in his first season back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Cleveland lost in six games to Golden State, but through no fault of James.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Forced to carry the scoring load following injuries to All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving and forward Kevin Love, James was brilliant against the Warriors, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 assists - the best statistical line in finals history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But it wasn't enough, and after dropping to 2-4 in the finals, James said he's more motivated than ever to bring a championship to Cleveland, which has gone without a major pro sports title since 1964.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Before free agency opened, James met in Los Angeles with Love, who said the pair had a ''very honest'' talk before the forward announced he would re-sign with Cleveland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''I always say, chase what you love and everything you love will chase you right back,'' Love said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>James can relate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He said numerous times last season that he and his wife, Savannah, and their three children, were happy being back in Ohio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He's at ease around the people who know him best, and he's determined to make good on his promise to deliver them a championship.</td></tr>
