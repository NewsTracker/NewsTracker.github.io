<h3>Italian right-wing leader says Facebook blocks his personal page</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Salvini, who is trying to establish himself as a contender to lead Italy's fractured opposition against center-left premier Matteo Renzi, frequently lambasts foreigners in an appeal to anti-immigrant sentiment which has grown during three years of economic recession and stagnation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bearded 42-year-old has posted messages this week about Nigerians, Roma and other east Europeans in Italy, prompting abusive responses from followers including suggestions immigrants should be shot or burned alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A Facebook spokeswoman said there was a temporary block on Salvini's page because it violated Facebook policies around "hate speech".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Facebook did not mention the word "gipsy" or the Italian equivalent, "zingara".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Salvini complained on Thursday that the social media site had expressed disapproval over the appearance on one of his two profiles of the term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He uploaded to Facebook and Twitter a video of a well-known song called "Zingara" by Italian singer Iva Zanicchi, asking if Facebook would block that too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Facebook blocked my personal profile for 24 hours because of the presence of the words "zin*ari" e "zin*are" in two posts. This is madness!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Salvini wrote on a profile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Once a junior partner in several governments headed by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, the League's popularity had steadily diminished until Salvini took over in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Its support has more than doubled since, but a poll released by research firm EMG this week showed support recently slipping for both the party and Salvini himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Another poll by the Piepoli institute showed the party's popularity had stabilized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In a televised interview earlier this week, Salvini said camps housing Roma people, mainly from Eastern Europe, that occupy the peripheries of Italian cities including Rome, should be razed.</td></tr>
