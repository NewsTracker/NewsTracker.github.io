<h3>The Latest on Nepal Quake: Gorkha Toll Could Change Picture</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Foreign tourists in Nepal are getting anxious as food, water and power remain scarce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hotel rooms are in short supply too so Pierre-Anne Dube, a 31-year-old from Quebec, has been sleeping on the sidewalk outside a hotel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Friends had been staying there for the first two days so she could use the bathroom and shower there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But they have checked out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Like many others she's scared and wants to get out on the first flight she can get.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We can't reach the embassy. We want to leave. We are scared. There is no food. We haven't eaten a meal since the earthquake and we don't have any news about what's going on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She had just returned from a trek to Everest base camp, which had been the "best experience of her life," but living the experience of the massive earthquake was definitely the "worst."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>- Katy Daigle, Kathmandu, Nepal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Israeli military said it is sending a search and rescue crew to Nepal on Monday to help locate survivors in the rubble, set up a medical field hospital for locals, and bring Israeli travelers home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A total of 260 Israeli military personnel are traveling to Nepal for the mission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The military says about 150 Israeli travelers have yet to establish contact after the earthquake and are believed to be missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The idea is to arrive and to try to establish communication with them," said Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Yoram Laredo, head of the Israeli military mission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In addition, Israel's emergency response service, Magen David Adom, is flying home a group of 18 Israelis who travelled to Nepal to receive babies born to Nepalese surrogate mothers, spokesman Zaki Heller said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>International aid agency Oxfam says it is is gearing up to deliver clean water and sanitation supplies to thousands of Nepalis now left homeless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They estimate that some 30,000 people are currently living in makeshift shelters in 16 government camps, too scared to return to their homes for fear of aftershocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We are managing to reach out to people in Kathmandu, but it is extremely difficult to provide support on a larger scale to the most affected areas - a lot of the main roads have been damaged," said Cecilia Keizer, Oxfam country director in Nepal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Our staff is still checking on their families and the partners we work with. At the moment, all the death count reports are coming from Kathmandu Valley. Sadly, I fear that this is only the beginning," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There's a lot that the world still doesn't really know about the Nepal quake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The key thing is this: How significant is the destruction in Gorkha district, 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the capital and the location of the quake's epicenter?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Roads to the area, difficult on good days, are damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Learning about the level of destruction and human toll in the vulnerable mountain villages there could change the whole picture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Villages like this are routinely affected by landslides," he says, "and it's not uncommon for entire villages of 200, 300, up to 1,000 people to be completely buried by rock falls."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Jagdish Pokhrel, the clearly exhausted army spokesman, says nearly the entire 100,000-soldier army is involved in rescue operations.</td></tr>
