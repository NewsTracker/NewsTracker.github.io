<h3>'Don't vote for Hillary Clinton' reads man's obituary</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Upright, 81, of Cabarrus County, N.C., died last Monday and when his family was writing his obituary at the funeral home, they decided to use the opportunity to pass along a message from their dear departed diehard Republican about the upcoming 2016 presidential election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The family asked that in lieu of flowers, a donation to the Shriners Hospital for Children would be appreciated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Also, the family respectfully asks that you do not vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016. R.I.P. Grandaddy," the obituary read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"He was very passionate about politics and probably passed a little of that on, so it was natural for me to think about that," daughter Jill McLain said of adding the anti-Clinton sentence to Upright's obituary, wsotv.com reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We did this for him," son Mike Upright said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"He had nothing to do with it other than voicing his opinion time after time after time.</td></tr>
