<h3>AFP &#039;will have further to say on Bali Nine&#039;</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The AFP says now is not the time to discuss the Bali Nine case out of respect for the grieving families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Australian Federal Police still plans to make a further statement on the events that led to the arrests of the Bali Nine, but will wait out of respect for the families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 34, were executed by firing squad shortly after midnight (3.25am AEST) on the Indonesian prison island of Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said now was not the time for recrimination and anger over the role played by the AFP in their arrests in 2005, along with seven other Australians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The involvement of the Australian Federal Police was reviewed a number of years ago and changes were made," she said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We are satisfied that the changes that are in place were appropriate. But I don't believe today is the time to look for recriminations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The AFP said it was premature to comment on the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"AFP Commissioner Andrew Colvin has publicly stated the AFP will make comment in relation to this matter," the AFP told AAP in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Now is not the time to discuss this matter out of respect for the grieving families."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The case will be examined at a Senate estimates committee hearing in the week of May 26, with Senator Nick Xenophon vowing to raise the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The senator will also write to federal parliament's joint standing committee on foreign affairs to ask that it be examined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This is not about recriminations, it's about making sure this never happens again," Senator Xenophon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Colvin last month said the AFP would not bear responsibility if Chan and Sukumaran, convicted for their roles in a plot to import 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia, were executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Put simply, do we have blood on our hands? No," Mr Colvin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Retired diplomat Bruce Haigh said the AFP's involvement and relationship with counterparts in Indonesia should be thoroughly and independently investigated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said the AFP must be subjected to greater oversight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It needs a thorough investigation by an independent body to see why it was that they decided to give these people up, the Bali Nine up," Mr Haigh said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Not only do we need to know what happened with the Bali Nine, we also need to know the nature of the relationship that the AFP has with their Indonesian counterparts."</td></tr>
