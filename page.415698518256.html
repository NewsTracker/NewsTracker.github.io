<h3>Eurozone economy gaining traction as survey near 4-year high</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON (AP) - The economy across the 19-country eurozone appears to be gaining momentum as a closely-watched survey Tuesday found business activity hit a near four-year high in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In its monthly survey, financial information company Markit said its purchasing managers' index for the region rose to 54.1 points in March from 53.3 in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That was higher than the 53.6 anticipated in the markets and puts the index at its highest level since May 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With anything above 50 indicating expansion, Markit says the survey points to quarterly growth of 0.3 percent in the first three months of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Though that's unchanged from the fourth quarter rate and below comparable levels in the U.S., it provides further evidence that the eurozone recovery is gaining a firm footing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Markit says the upturn was largely fueled by new orders, with manufacturers in particular getting a boost from the weaker euro, which makes exports more competitive in international markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It also said that the improvement was broad-based across sectors with Germany, the currency bloc's biggest economy, doing particularly well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>France, though lagging Germany, is also seeing its best performance since 2011, according to Markit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, said the European Central Bank's recently launched monetary stimulus has started "at a time when the eurozone's economic upturn is already starting to gain traction."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Earlier this month, the ECB started its 1.1 trillion-euro ($1.2 trillion) bond-buying stimulus program which it hopes will shore up the eurozone economy by keeping a lid on borrowing rates and getting inflation back to its target of just below 2 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the year to February, prices across the eurozone were down 0.3 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Markit found some hope on that front, too, noting that downward pressure on prices eased during March as a result of higher wages and rising imports costs resulting from the euro's appreciation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Though broadly optimistic, Markit did sound a note of caution over the outlook.</td></tr>
