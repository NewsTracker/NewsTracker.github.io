<h3>Greek coast guard rescues 38 migrants off western coast</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) " The Greek coast guard rescued 38 migrants Tuesday found on a small boat off the country's western coast in the Ionian Sea, following a search and rescue operation launched after one of the passengers called authorities for help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The migrant boat was found off the island of Paxoi and those on board were rescued by a coast guard patrol boat and a private vessel sailing in the area, the coast guard said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Authorities had said they believed 45 people were on board, but later revised the figure downwards and said there were no reports of anyone missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was not immediately clear what type of problem the boat had experienced, or where the migrants were from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tens of thousands of migrants cross from the nearby Turkish coast into Greece each year, hoping to make their way to more prosperous European Union countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>From Greece, many try to go head north overland through Macedonia or Albania, while others attempt to sail to Italy or sneak onto Italy-bound ferries sailing from western Greek ports.</td></tr>
