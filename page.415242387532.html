<h3>Emirates forges special relationship with el-Sissi's Egypt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The United Arab Emirates has pumped billions of dollars into Egypt and is lining up investors to try to stabilize its damaged economy, while building military cooperation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FILE - In this Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2015, file photo, Emirati officials visit the UAE Egypt stand during the last day of the Government Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>In this Wednesday, March 5, 2015 photo, Egyptians walk in front of Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan hospital in Cairo, Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - This small Gulf nation, known for its soaring skyscrapers and mercantile bent, is making itself into the most stalwart ally of the Arab world's biggest country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In their deepening relationship, an economically exhausted Egypt benefits from the UAE's finances, and the U.S.-allied Emirates gets a heavyweight with extensive manpower on its side in a region deeply unstable with threats of militant violence and Iranian expansion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We are among the vanguards calling for stability in Egypt, whose security represents a cornerstone of Arab world security," Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan told a full house during his speech at a governance conference held in Dubai last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We cannot keep our fingers crossed about achieving stability and development in Egypt."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That conference put the UAE-Egypt relationship front and center among the 80 nations attending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A slick, museum-worthy display outside the vast conference hall spotlighted the countries' close ties, declaring in a logo, "Among its many brotherly neighbors, Egypt holds a special place with the United Arab Emirates."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Egypt's prime minister, Ibrahim Mahlab, had a prime speaking spot, which he used to praise the Emirates' "wise leadership" and the two nations' friendship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Emirates is also a key organizer of an economic development conference aimed at enticing investors to Egypt and reviving its economy, to be held next week in the Sinai resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Egypt the Future investment conference's speakers list presents a who's who of the Emirati corporate elite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Executives from Western blue-chip names like General Electric and Coca Cola will share the stage with UAE-based heads of telecom Etisalat Group, private equity firm Abraaj Capital, and the real estate developer behind the world's tallest skyscraper, Emaar Properties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Executives from the Gulf nation's aviation, banking and energy industries will be there too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Emirati construction giant Arabtec Holding has ambitious plans for a $40 billion project to build 1 million middle-income homes across Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It has said the project will create more than a million jobs in Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Arabtec helped raise Dubai's record-breaking Burj Khalifa skyscraper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Its biggest shareholder is Aabar Investments, which is controlled by the government of the oil-rich Emirati capital, Abu Dhabi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Minister of State Sultan al-Jaber, an Emirati official with one of the few seats on the conference's steering committee, promised the event will be "a first step in the implementation of a larger strategy that will ensure Egypt's economic revival."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Egypt's economy has been gutted by turmoil since the 2011 uprising that ousted autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Foreign investment and tourism revenues dried up, depleting foreign currency reserves and driving up unemployment, and frequent rounds of violence in the country have frustrated attempts to rebuild.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait pumped billions of dollars into Egypt following the military's ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in July 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Like Saudi Arabia and new Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, the Emirates sees Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood as a threat and moved aggressively to stamp out sympathizers of the group in the wake of the Arab Spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It followed Cairo's and Riyadh's lead in branding the group a terrorist organization in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A UAE government report shows that Egypt is by far the biggest single recipient of donor cash from the Emirates, with $4.6 billion distributed just in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Egypt's aid share was 29 times more than that of the next largest recipient, Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In addition to providing direct cash aid, the OPEC member has been building schools, clinics, wheat silos and tens of thousands of homes as part of at least $10 billion earmarked for Egypt since Morsi's ouster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In October 2013 it opened a hospital named after the federation's founder, Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan, in the Manshiyat Nasser slum on the outskirts of Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In contrast, before Morsi's fall, Egypt had been in talks for several years with the International Monetary Fund for a $4.8 billion loan, but the talks never reached a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>For Egypt, the benefit of an enthusiastic, deep-pocketed patron is obvious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But the Emirates stands to gain, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The seven-state federation sees Egypt as central to regional security given its location, the size of its population and its outsize historical and cultural role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>As the Arab world's second biggest economy - after Saudi Arabia - the Emirates has plenty to spend on its defense budget and boasts one of the region's best-equipped militaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>What it doesn't have is Egypt's manpower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The UAE is home to only about 9 million people, fewer than one in five of them citizens with the foreign workers and their families making up the rest - compared to Egypt's 90 million people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"Egypt is the No. 1 strategic partner for the UAE outside the Gulf itself. It's partly because they share a very similar vision for the region, and a very similar threat perception," said Jane Kinninmont, a Middle East expert at British think tank Chatham House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"Their defense and security establishments really see eye to eye," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"Muslim Brotherhood concerns have brought them closer together."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The growing ties were on display in a series of bilateral military exercises last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Photos released following one set of drills showed el-Sissi, clad in fatigues, peering off the deck of a warship, with Emirati Prime Minister Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and Abu Dhabi's powerful crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, at his side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The training may well have paid off when, according to American officials, the two nations teamed up in August to bomb Islamic militants in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Egyptian officials have said Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and UAE were in talks late last year over creating a military pact to face militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Now el-Sissi is looking to formalize the bonds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Last week, in the wake of the beheading in Libya of a group of Egyptian Christians by Islamic State militants, the soldier-turned-politician called for the creation of a joint Arab military force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Two countries, he added, had separately offered to deploy military forces to help Egypt: Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.</td></tr>

<h3>The fate of MH370 is still a mystery, but search has discovered many underwater secrets</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The search for the missing MH370 aircraft has scoured the depths of the Indian Ocean for almost a year and found no trace of the plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>While this must be heartbreaking for victims' loved ones, the search has yielded many discoveries about a part of the deep ocean scientists knew very little about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Detailed mapping has revealed mountains as high as Mount Kosciuszko, canyons the size of the Grand Canyon and a never before seen 34-kilometre-long undersea ridge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Geoscience Australia's Stuart Minchin said previously the only information about this region, and most of the world's deep oceans, came from satellite images that offered a coarse outline of the seafloor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Slightly more detailed information was gathered along random transect lines from the odd ship carrying a basic sonar, but combined these maps were not sufficient to guide underwater vehicles as they searched for the plane in regions as deep as 6000 metres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A 3D model of a section of seafloor in the MH370 search area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>From June to October the underwater surveying company Fugro hired to carry out the search deployed a ship with multibeam sonars to survey slightly more than 100,000 square kilometres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The sonars release a series of acoustic signals shaped like a fan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The time taken for the signal to return reveals the water depth while the strength of the signal strength infers whether it has bounced off something hard or soft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fugro's project director Paul Kennedy said the second, more detailed phase of search used side scanners mounted on an autonomous submarine and small underwater vehicles towed about 100 metres above the seafloor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Since November they have mapped about 40 per cent of the 30,000 square kilometre priority search area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A map of the broad and narrow MH370 search areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The autonomous vehicle is searching inside a volcano at the moment," said Mr Kennedy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In some places the estimates of the seafloor depth from satellite imagery were wrong by up to 1.5 kilometres, said Dr Minchin,chief of the Environmental Geoscience Division at Geoscience Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We've found underwater remnant volcanoes, in one case it is about 14 kilometres in diameter and 2.2 kilometres in height. Those features were invisible in the data previously," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>An autonomous underwater vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>One of the most massive features they spied is a 34-kilometre-long ridge, seven kilometres wide and 1.5 kilometres high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It was not known previously. It didn't appear in the chart," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Dr Minchin said while the focus was now on the search, the data would be useful for geographers and oceanographers for many years to come.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The search area is not far from where two tectonic plates, the Indo-Australia and the Antarctic plates, meet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"What you can see on the seafloor is a history of how those plates have moved apart."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Many of the ridges are the result of two continental plates shifting and the underlying magma rising to the surface and creating new crust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The data will be publicly available once the search is complete.</td></tr>
