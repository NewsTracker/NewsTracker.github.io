<h3>North Queensland warned on Cyclone Nathan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Far north Queenslanders in Cyclone Nathan's firing line have been told to brace for a more frightening and destructive storm than the one they endured a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Bureau of Meteorology expects Nathan to cross the coast just north of Cape Flattery, near the towns of Hope Vale and Cooktown, around 4am on Friday as a category four system that will deliver winds of up to 260km/h.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the bureau hasn't ruled out Nathan, which first threatened the coastline last week, intensifying into a maximum-strength category five before it made landfall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Tonight will be a frightening event for many families," Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I express on behalf of all Queenslanders that our thoughts and prayers are with all those families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Cooktown residents have been advised Nathan will pack a bigger punch than Cyclone Ita, which they weathered last April when it unleashed 200km/h winds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Large trees were toppled, roofs were ripped from homes and a nearby banana plantation at Hope Vale was destroyed by Ita.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cyclone Nathan's arrival will also herald a unnerving sense of deja vu for north Queensland, given it will hit on the ninth anniversary of Cyclone Larry which brought widespread destruction as a category five system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At 5pm AEST on Thursday, Nathan was a category three with wind gusts of up to 195km/h, situated about 165km east of Cape Flattery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Bureau spokesman Neil Bennett says Nathan's wrath would be felt in the region for hours, given its likely to still be a category two cyclone by 2pm on Friday - about 10 hours after first making landfall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's a reasonably small cyclone in terms of its actual size, but the impact it's going to have is over a fairly large area," he told AAP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Bennett said there was also a risk that Cyclone Nathan, despite weakening over land, could reform once it crossed Queensland and reached open water in the Gulf of Carpenteria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The bureau's regional director, Rob Webb, summed Nathan's impact up succinctly: "This is a small system, but it does pack a punch."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ms Palaszczuk on Thursday urged affected communities to make preparations before nightfall and said government agencies, which had recently dealt with category five Cyclone Marcia, would be on hand to assist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Cooktown's cyclone shelter was this month downgraded to a place of refuge while an assessment of its structural integrity is carried out, although mayor Peter Scott was confident of its strength as it opened on Thursday afternoon.</td></tr>
