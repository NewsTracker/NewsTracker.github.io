<h3>Google unveils 'buy' button, new shopping features</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google on Wednesday unveiled a new feature called "Purchases on Google," which allows shopper to buy items directly from mobile search ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The eagerly awaited "buy" feature, which Google said it was testing with a few retailers, uses saved payment credentials from the user's Google Account for transactions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Both Google and Facebook have been stepping up efforts to advance location-based technology as consumers spend more time on smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Along with the ads that pull up in search results, shoppers would also get information on product ratings and availability at nearby stores, the Internet search giant said in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The additional information will be available on Google Chrome for Android this month, with iOS support to follow in the coming months, the company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google also said its Google Now service is offering location-based information, including on discounts on items and the working hours of stores a user is close to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The service will also be able to access a user's browsing history to show if the price of a product a shopper has searched for in the past has fallen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Google also said it would work with online e-commerce companies such as eBay, and direct customers to these companies' mobile apps instead of their websites.</td></tr>
