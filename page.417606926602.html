<h3>Islamic State: not just beheadings but taxes and business rules too</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sanliurfa, Turkey: The Syrian businessman was enjoying a much-needed holiday in Turkey when the phone call came from the tax inspector of the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His business partner in Raqqa had been arrested, the inspector told him, and he would not be released until he paid the $131,000 ($US100,000) that it owed the "caliphate".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"They told me that because I have a lot of money, I have to pay my share," said "Ammar", who asked for his real name not to be used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They analyse your income and take a percentage."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>As IS, also known as ISIL or ISIS, establishes its empire, the jihadists have become fastidious bureaucrats - imposing taxes, paying fixed salaries and introducing trading standards laws to try to create a healthy economy that will sustain their autocratic rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Yet despite brutal punishments for those who break the rules, many Syrian businessmen prefer it to the anarchy that prevails in areas controlled by other rebel groups, including the Western-backed Free Syrian Army.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ammar, who deals in cars, houses and poultry, is largely secular and privately despises the jihadists, referring to the IS-held "capital" of Raqqa as "the big prison".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But he admits that he now works almost exclusively in their areas, having had $US150,000 worth of stock stolen by a gang in turf run by another armed faction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Likewise, when he traded in areas controlled by the Syrian government, he was detained by a pro-regime militia, who demanded a bribe of $US25,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While IS charges zakat - an Islamic alms payment similar to income tax - from those who can afford it, Ammar says that in return businesses are protected from theft and corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"When I take chickens that I have bought from farmers in the rural areas to Raqqa, the first thing I have to do is go to the zakat office and pay the 2.5 per cent. They give me a voucher that allows me to sell my produce in the city," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The model is being applied across IS territory in Syria, and to such a degree that businesses are now choosing to move their industry into IS areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Factories in Sheikh Najjar, on the front line, have moved to IS-controlled Minbaj, residents and business owners said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hassan, an engineer, said: "The majority of people live in a good enough situation but you have to hold your tongue. If you have some money, and can keep your mouth shut, it is OK."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In part, the attraction of IS-controlled areas is that they are safer from the barrel bombs the regime drops on other rebel factions' strongholds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>IS areas are subject to strikes by American jet fighters, but they are less indiscriminate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In public services, teachers are allowed to continue to work, provided they agree to a new curriculum that bans English and science.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Doctors and engineers, particularly those managing IS-controlled oilfields, are paid handsomely.</td></tr>
