<h3>Batman shooter trial: James Holmes verdict - live</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>That's all from our live coverage of the James Holme guilty verdict - here is our full story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Many have wondered why it took so long to get to this point when there was never any doubt that Holmes carried out the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was because prosecutors were determined to tick every legal box and leave no room for Holmes' lawyers to appeal on a technicality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prosecutors are also determined that Holmes should be put to death for the crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At one point his lawyers offered a deal under which he would have pleaded guilty in return for a sentence of life in prison without parole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That would have spared relatives the pain of hearing the horrific details of the massacre detailed in open court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But prosecutor George Brauchler rejected that option after consulting with the relatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Whatever the emotional cost, they want Holmes to pay the ultimate price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The jury deliberated for 13 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Holmes, dressed in beige slacks and a blue shirt, stood with his hands in his pockets and showed little reaction as the verdicts were read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>James Holmes convicted of mureer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The jury has reached a verdict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Holmes' defence lawler told the court on Monday during closing arguments that his client was insane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The fact of the matter is that when Mr Holmes stepped into that theater... he had lost touch with reality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>You cannot divorce the mental illness from this case, or from Mr Holmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The mental illness caused this to happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Only the mental illness caused this to happen, and nothing else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Monday, a prosecutor broke down as he told the jury that Holmes was sane at the time of the massacre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They (the audience) came in hoping to see a story of a hero dressed in black, someone who would fight insurmountable odds in the name of justice and trying to protect others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Instead, a different figure appeared by the screen dressed all in black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And he came there with one thing in his heart and in his mind, and that was mass murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Brauchler described how Holmes, 27, opened fire randomly in the cinema in Aurora, Colorado, which was showing The Dark Knight Rises, on July 20, 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Holmes' trial lasted almost three months, during which the jurors heard from two court-appointed psychiatrists who concluded he was sane, and two working for the defense who found he was legally insane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>If the jury agrees that Holmes was insane, he would avoid execution and likely spend the rest of his life committed to the state's mental hospital in Pueblo, 100 miles (160 km) south of Denver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Under Colorado's insanity defense law, the prosecution must prove he was sane for him to be found guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>If jurors return a guilty verdict on any of the murder charges, a penalty phase would be held during which prosecutors would present aggravating evidence to make their case for the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The defense team would argue mitigating factors against execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>If Holmes is convicted of first degree murder, a decision to spare his life in the penalty phase would result in a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Holmes did not testify in his own defense, but jurors watched video of some 23 hours of interviews conducted with him by one of the court-appointed psychiatrists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Here is a profile of James Holmes by The Telegraph's Nick Allen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>James Eagan Holmes was born on December 13, 1987 in San Diego, the son of a Stanford-educated mathematician and a nurse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He grew up in a suburb where his family attended the Lutheran church and "Jimmy" excelled at school, getting a reputation among fellow students as a "brainiac" who also loved football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He was, they thought, a "bit odd" but not deranged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The first video footage of him dates from 2006 and shows Holmes as an 18-year-old standing in front of slightly baffled members of a science summer camp at Del Mar College in San Diego.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In a presentation he described how he he had been studying "temporal illusions - an illusion that allows you to change the past" and also "subjective experience, which is what takes place inside the mind as oppose to the external world".</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>His goal, the audience heard, was to make scientific discoveries, but he also wanted to own a Slurpee machine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He seemed nervous and nerd-like, but not threatening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The verdict comes nearly three years to the day of the shootings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Holmes's lawyers argued that he was in the grips of a psychotic episode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Holmes killed 12 people and wounded a further 70.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Here are pictures of Holmes shown by the prosecution during their statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Good evening and welcome to our live coverage as the jury in the Colorado cinema massacre trial reached a verdict on the second day of deliberations in the case of 27-year-old gunman James Holmes, who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The verdict will be read at 4:15 p.m. local time (11.15pm UK time), a court spokesman said on Twitter.</td></tr>
