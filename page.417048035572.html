<h3>Earthquakes on Hawaii volcano could signal new eruption</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>HONOLULU (AP) - A series of earthquakes and shifting ground on the slopes of Kilauea have scientists wondering what will happen next at one of the world's most active volcanos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A lake of lava near the summit of Kilauea on Hawaii's Big Island had risen to a record-high level after a recent explosion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But in the past few days, the pool of molten rock began sinking, and the surface of the lava lake fell nearly 500 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Meanwhile, a rash of earthquakes rattled the volcano with as many as 20 to 25 quakes per hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Volcano scientist Steve Brantley says the lava has been dropping out of sight, and it has to be going somewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He says one possibility is that a new lava eruption could break through the surface of the mountain.</td></tr>
