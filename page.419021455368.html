<h3>Greek stock market reopens with 22 percent plunge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greece's main stock index plunged over 22 percent as it reopened Monday after a five-week closure, giving investors their first opportunity since late June to react to the country's latest economic crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greek bank stocks suffered the most, hitting or nearing the daily trading limit of a 30 percent loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Markets in the rest of Europe, however, were largely unaffected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Athens Stock Exchange and Greek banks were closed on June 29, when the government imposed controls on money withdrawals and transfers to keep a run on bank deposits from causing the financial system to collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Banks have since reopened, while maintaining strict cash withdrawal limits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greece is expected to head back into recession in 2015 - after briefly emerging from a six-year contraction - due to the effects of capital controls and months of uncertainty over the country's future in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A man walks with his dog past a mural at a central neighborhood in Athens, Greece, on Sunday, Aug.</td></tr>
