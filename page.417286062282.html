<h3>Kenya police clash with Shebab in Garissa</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kenyan police have fought a fierce battle with Shebab militants after an ambush near the border with Somalia, officials said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The militants claimed in a statement that at least 20 police were killed, although Kenyan authorities insisted that only five officers were wounded, with Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery dismissing claims of fatalities as "propaganda".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Monday night attack came just days after extra Kenyan security forces were deployed in the area to strengthen security after a series of raids by gunmen from the Somali-led Al-Qaeda branch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Security sources said the officers were attacked close to the village of Yumbis, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) northeast of Garissa and the scene of a clash between the Shebab and Kenyan security forces last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They were ambushed as they went to assist other police who had been targeted by an explosive device, believed to be a landmine or improvised roadside bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Mujahedeen fighters conducted a successful attack on the Christian troops of Kenya and the death toll is more than 20, five vehicles were also burned down," Shebab spokesman Abdulaziz Abu Musab said in a statement posted on a pro-militant website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kenya media and local officials initially said that between 10 and 20 police were killed, while a police spokesman said 13 officers were missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"There was an ambush on officers who were on patrol and as a result, 13 officers are missing," police spokesman George Kinoti said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"More police officers have been dispatched to look for those missing and the attackers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Garissa County Commissioner James Kianda contradicted that account -- insisting to reporters in Garissa that all officers had been accounted for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The interior ministry said there were five wounded, with one officer airlifted to Nairobi and another in a critical condition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Garissa County has remained volatile with numerous attacks since last month when four Shebab militants stormed Garissa University College, killing 142 students and six members of the security forces during a day-long siege.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It was the group's deadliest attack in Kenya to date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Also last week, Shebab militants briefly took control of a mosque in the area, delivering a hardline sermon to captive worshippers before leaving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Once a Somalia-focused insurgent group, Shebab has in recent years turned its attention to Kenya, demanding it withdraw soldiers who were deployed to Somalia in 2011, and launching a series of attacks including the 2013 assault on Nairobi's Westgate mall that killed at least 67 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It remains unclear if the latest string of attacks have been carried out by Shebab units based in Somalia, or the group's cells inside Kenya -- where the militants have stepped up recruitment and operations.</td></tr>
