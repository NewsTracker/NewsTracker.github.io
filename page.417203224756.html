<h3>Marlins lose to Orioles 8-5; Alvarez and Latos go on DL (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MIAMI (AP) -- Even after Friday's game, the losses kept coming for the Miami Marlins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>First the Marlins stumbled to another defeat, leaving them 0-8 on their homestand and still winless after five games under new manager Dan Jennings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Then two-fifths of their rotation went on the disabled list - right-handers Henderson Alvarez and Mat Latos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Alvarez (0-4), who pitched five-plus innings and took the defeat, was sidelined with a recurrence of right shoulder inflammation, which sidelined him for five weeks earlier this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His shoulder began bothering him again in the fifth or sixth inning, Jennings said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Latos, who is 1-4 with a 6.12 ERA, went on the DL with left knee inflammation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He underwent surgery on the knee in 2014, when he was limited to 16 starts with Cincinnati.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Roster and rotation replacements for the two starters will be announced Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''It's tough,'' Jennings said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''Someone is going to get an opportunity to step up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Jennings is off to the worst start by a first-time manager since Brad Mills opened 0-8 after taking over the Astros in 2010, according to STATS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Miami native Manny Machado had two hits and three RBIs for Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Caleb Joseph contributed three hits, including a two-run single, and Jimmy Paredes also had three hits to hike his average to .353.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Orioles overcame a 3-0 deficit for their fourth victory in the past five games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They improved to 2-11 all-time in Miami, where they're making their first visit since 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''We've been struggling with the bats,'' Machado said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''It was great to come back after being down a couple of runs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Meanwhile, the Marlins keep losing, and their fans are losing patience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They booed when Jennings emerged from the dugout to replace Alvarez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>They booed Steve Cishek when he gave up a two-run single.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They even booed crowd favorite Giancarlo Stanton when he popped out with two runners on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Marlins' eight-game losing streak is their longest since an eight-game skid in April 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''It's little things, and right now it just snowballs,'' Cishek said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''We just want to win a game and tell ourselves we can do it at this point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It'll happen, no doubt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>I'm just thankful it's early in the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But we don't want to wait around much longer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>One bright spot for the Marlins: Major league batting leader Dee Gordon singled twice and tied a franchise record with four stolen bases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''I will take the way they're battling,'' Jennings said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Rookie Tyler Wilson (1-0) gave up a run in one innings but earned his first career victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>With a runner on, Zach Britton retired the only batter he faced for his 10th save in 11 chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Baltimore starter Ubaldo Jimenez needed 87 pitches to get through four innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He allowed three runs and departed for a pinch hitter, NL-style.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The Orioles used five pitchers, and they were often working out of jams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Miami had 14 hits but stranded 12 runners and went 3 for 19 with runners in scoring position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>For the third time in two games, the Marlins mishandled a bunt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Alvarez made a wild throw to third trying for a forceout, and the error led to two unearned runs when the Orioles went ahead to stay with four runs in the sixth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Before the game, Orioles INF Everth Cabrera (foot) was activated from the 15-day disabled list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>INF Rey Navarro was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Orioles: C Matt Wieters is eligible to come off the 60-day disabled list June 4, and he believes that is a realistic target date for his return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>RHP Bud Norris (bronchitis) allowed nine runs on 12 hits in 2 2-3 innings in a rehab start for Triple-A Norfolk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>RHP Mike Wright, who threw 7 1-3 shutout innings to win his major league debut Sunday, is scheduled to start Saturday for Baltimore against Miami and Dan Haren (4-2, 3.47).</td></tr>
