<h3>As playoffs near, the Spurs rounding into top form (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Must be spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Here comes San Antonio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Winners of 22 of their last 26 games to close last year's regular season - the perfect tuneup to what became a title run - the Spurs are at it again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They're 21-3 in their last 24 games, rising from the bottom of the Western Conference playoff pack to quite possibly the team to beat in this year's playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And the message from those who've played them lately?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Be afraid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Be very afraid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''To me, they're still the best team in the NBA,'' Miami forward Udonis Haslem said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Golden State and Atlanta might argue, but perhaps to no avail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Since Feb. 27, no team in the league has a better record, better scoring average, better field-goal percentage or better free-throw percentage than the Spurs - who figure to have a great chance to do the one thing that's missing from their franchise's glistening resume.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The five-time champions have never won back-to-back titles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That might change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''They are rounding into form,'' said Golden State coach Steve Kerr, whose team has the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>1 overall playoff seed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''They are doing what championship teams do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>You try to make it through the regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>You try to peak at the right time and they are peaking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>For much of the year, the Spurs looked, well, mortal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They lost nine out of 13 in one stretch in December, including a bizarre run of three straight home defeats - one in overtime, then the other two both in triple overtime over a three-day span.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They came back from the All-Star break as their annual road trip when the rodeo visits San Antonio continued, and promptly lost four in a row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''It's usually around the rodeo trip in February where we really kind of turn that corner, but it didn't work out that way this time and it took a little longer,'' Spurs forward Tim Duncan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It took Kawhi Leonard - the NBA Finals MVP from last year - about half the season to get right, after dealing with first an eye infection and then a torn hand ligament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Tony Parker basically had to sit out all of December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Manu Ginobili missed four games last month with a bad ankle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Now, they're rolling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''We are starting to play the way we want to play right now,'' Duncan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Scary thought, given the way they're playing right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Spurs have won their last 11 overall - basically going from No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>7 to No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>2 in the West in that span, although the second seed is far from locked up - and are 15-1 at home since February began.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>That one home loss came on a night where Cleveland's Kyrie Irving scored 57 points in one of the best shooting displays the league has seen in a long time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>From March 25 through April 8, not only did the Spurs win all nine of their games, but they won each by at least 12 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>No team in NBA history has ever had a longer such streak; San Antonio's run matched the 2008-09 Cavaliers and the 2011-12 Heat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>That was on March 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The Spurs have lost once since, and Popovich says what the Spurs are doing without the ball has been key.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>''We know we can't win a championship without defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Everybody knows that,'' Popovich said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>At some point, this unbelievable Spurs run - 16 straight 50-win seasons, 18 straight seasons winning at least 61 percent of their games, 18 straight playoff appearances once they start play against someone in a Game 1 this weekend - will end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Duncan turns 39 in a couple weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Ginobili is 37.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Popovich is 66.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Of course, people have been saying that about the Spurs for a while.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>''We've always done this since I've been here,'' Parker said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>''I have no idea,'' Parker said.</td></tr>
