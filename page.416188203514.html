<h3>I&#039;m running for president: Hillary Clinton</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Former secretary of state and US first lady Hillary Clinton has launched another bid to become the first woman to win the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hillary Clinton has jumped back into US presidential politics, announcing she will again seek the White House in 2016 with a promise to serve as the champion of "everyday Americans".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Unlike eight years ago, when she ran and lost to Barack Obama, Clinton and her personal history weren't the focus of the first message of her campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She made no mention of her time in the Senate and her four years as secretary of state, or her potential to make history as the country's first female president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Instead, the video is a collection of voters talking about their lives, their plans and aspirations for the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times. But the deck is still stacked in favour of those at the top. Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion," Clinton said near the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton's video and new website are scant on policy specifics but the message made an immediate play to win the support of Democrats for whom economic inequality has become a defining issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Clinton now plans to head to the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, looking to connect with voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clinton hopes to avoid the same stumbles in 2008, when she entered the race as a heavy favourite only to be upset by Obama in Iowa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The 67-year-old Clinton brings a long public record to her second bid for the White House, a history that will both help and hurt her candidacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Republicans were already pushing a message that seeks to attach her to the scandalous upheavals of her husband Bill Clinton's two-term presidency in the 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Obama said on Saturday that he thinks Clinton "would be an excellent president".</td></tr>
