<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Then he called in the coordinates for an airstrike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was a chilling reminder that Boko Haram extremists still are in northeast Nigeria with all sorts of weapons even as Nigeria's military officials boast that they have ousted them from all major towns and forest camps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Each day brings new reports of atrocities, with mass graves being discovered in towns seized back from the militants who had tried to set up an "Islamic caliphate" across a great swath of northeast Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Just this week, survivors described how the insurgents arrived in a village, saying they had come to preach Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When villagers gathered in front of the mosque, the extremists opened fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>When some ran into the mosque, the militants set it ablaze, burning alive some of their victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"As I speak to you, all the towns they previously occupied ... have been cleared, so they really have no base," said defense ministry spokesman Maj.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Gen. Chris Olukolade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"All we are doing at the moment is mopping up and conducting cordon and search for weapons and as many of them as may be straggling."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Boko Haram has been left "marauding from place to place," he told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The AP and journalists from other media organizations were taken on Wednesday by military helicopter to Gwoza, a "newly liberated" city of burned-out buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On the outskirts, an Arabic script sign left by the militants was smashed to the ground.</td></tr>

<tr><td>22</td><td>"Two months after the beginning of this war, we have not had a single direct contact on the ground with units of the Nigerian army. This is why, more than once, Chadian forces have been obliged to retake towns and advance again," Deby said in an interview published March 26 in the French magazine Le Point.</td></tr>
