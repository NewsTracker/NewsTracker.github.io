<h3>Bali nine executions: Indonesian government warns it will not respond to threats</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Threats are not part of diplomatic language," Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"And from what I know no one responds well to threats."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Earlier Mr Abbott said Australia would let Indonesia know in "absolutely unambiguous terms that we feel grievously let down" if the executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran proceeded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Let's not forget that a few years ago, when Indonesia was struck by the Indian Ocean tsunami, Australia sent $1 billion worth of assistance, we sent a significant contingent of our armed forces to help in Indonesia with humanitarian relief and Australians lost their lives in that campaign to help Indonesia," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Nasir said there was a saying in Indonesian "orang akan terlihat warna sebenarnya" (people will show their true colours).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"So I hope the statement (Mr Abbott) made doesn't show the true color of Australians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>WARNING SHOT: Indonesia has responded with a warning that it does not respond to threats, after Tony Abbott's reminder that Australia provided aid and manpower to the country after the 2004 tsunami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"But I would like just to remind Australia that bilateral relationships, in my understanding, cut two ways," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It is difficult for Indonesia to see that any fallout in the bilateral relationship would only affect one country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Abbott's comments marked the Australian government's strongest response to the planned executions to date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said a short delay in Chan and Sukumaran's planned executions was an "encouraging straw in the wind" but was no sign of clemency and warned there would be consequences if the pair are killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We will be making our displeasure known, we will be letting Indonesia know in absolutely unambiguous terms that we will feel grievously let down," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I would say to the Indonesian people and to the Indonesian government, we in Australia are always there to help you and we hope that you might reciprocate in this way at this time," he pleaded.</td></tr>
