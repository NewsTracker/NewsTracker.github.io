<h3>NBC News' Nancy Snyderman resigns following Ebola quarantine scandal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Dr. Nancy Snyderman said Thursday that she's leaving her job as chief medical editor for NBC News, six months after unleashing public anger for failing to observe a quarantine after covering the Ebola epidemic last fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Snyderman said that "becoming part of the story" after her trip to Liberia contributed to her decision to take a faculty job at a medical school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Every moment has been an honor," said Snyderman, who has been at NBC for nine years after working previously at ABC News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dr. Nancy Snyderman had been in Liberia working with infected Ebola patient Ashoka Mukpo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After she was seen picking up a take out order, she received lots of backlash for violating her voluntary quarantine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Snyderman was asked to observe a voluntary 21-day quarantine in her New Jersey home following her return from Liberia, where she briefly worked with Ashoka Mukpo, a cameraman who caught the virus and recovered after coming back to the U.S. for treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But she was observed getting takeout food near her home, prompting New Jersey authorities to make her quarantine mandatory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>NBC was flooded with angry comments about her actions, which also angered her bosses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After being told to lay low for a while, Snyderman returned to the air on Dec. 3 and apologized for her actions in an interview with Matt Lauer, saying she did not appreciate how frightened Americans were of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While she continued working after that, she never did another Ebola story for NBC News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Her last time on the air, on Feb. 22, was to report on peanut allergies for "Nightly News."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Snyderman would not say where her new job would be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"More needs to be done to communicate medicine and science to our viewers and citizens, especially in times of crisis, and with my experiences in the field and on air, that is going to be a priority for me," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>NBC said in a statement that Snyderman has been a valuable voice, "and we wish her all the best."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Her exit removes a distraction for new NBC News Group Chairman Andrew Lack, hired last week to bring order to the network after a string of embarrassments, including Snyderman's episode but most prominently the suspension of "Nightly News" anchor Brian Williams.</td></tr>

<h3>Man recalls ?terrifying? carjacking at Boston bombing trial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Dun Meng testified that he had gone for a drive to relax after a long day at work on April 18, 2013, and had pulled over to check his phone when Tamerlan Tsarnaev tapped on his window, stepped into his car and pulled a gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"He pulled the magazine out of the gun to show me there's bullets in the gun. He told me, 'You know, I'm serious, so don't be stupid,'" Meng, who works at a tech company that develops cell phone apps for ordering food, said in federal court in Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"After that, he asked me, 'Do you know the Boston Marathon explosion?' I said, 'Yes, I know.' He asked, 'Do you know who did it?' I said, "No, I don't.' He said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tamerlan, 26, died later that night after he and younger brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev engaged in a shootout with police in the Boston suburb of Watertown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The surviving Tsarnaev, 21, is accused of killing three people and injuring 264 with a pair of homemade bombs at the race's finish line on April 15, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev could be sentenced to death if a jury finds him guilty of the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His lawyers opened the trial last week by bluntly admitting that their client had carried out the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They hope to spare him from the death penalty by convincing the jury that the older brother was the driving force behind the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Despite the admission, Tsarnaev has maintained his official "not guilty" plea, leaving it to federal prosecutors to first prove his guilt before the trial can move on to its second, sentencing phase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Earlier on Thursday, the jury viewed autopsy photos of Sean Collier, a university police officer who prosecutors contend the brothers shot dead shortly before the carjacking, in an unsuccessful effort to steal his gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the first five days of testimony, the full court viewed gruesome photos and video of the injuries caused by the pressure-cooker bombs that ripped through the crowd at the finish line, causing more than a dozen people to lose legs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But U.S. District Judge George O'Toole ordered autopsy photos of Collier, 27, to be shown only to the jury out of respect for his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some jurors could be seen tearing up as they viewed the photos of Collier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The court also viewed pictures of blood pooled in his squad car's cup holders and on its floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Collier's death marked the start of a chaotic 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>After Meng escaped the carjacking, when the pair stopped at a gas station, the Tsarnaevs hurled explosives at police during a gunfight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The shooting ended when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev roared off in Meng's Mercedes, running over and killing his brother before disappearing into a drydocked boat in the Boston suburb of Watertown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Police found him the next evening, after a day-long lockdown of the Boston area when hundreds of thousands of people hid in their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The bombing killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, and graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, as well as 8-year-old Martin Richard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Meng said the most frightening moment of his carjacking came when he decided to escape while Dzhokhar shopped for snacks at a gas station and Tamerlan fussed with a navigation system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This seems the most terrifying moment, most difficult decision in my life," Meng said, adding that Tamerlan had told him he would not be killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I was struggling, should I trust him about that? Or should I take this chance by myself to run away?"</td></tr>
