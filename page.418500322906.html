<h3>UN: Africas Ebola outbreak has not run its course</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Children in Monrovia, Liberia, in August 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But an Ebola flare-up in Liberia has proved a setback, prompting concern from health experts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Africa's Ebola epidemic has yet to run its course, infecting an estimated 30 people each week, the United Nations' special envoy for the disease warned Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The outbreak of the virus - which has resulted in the deaths of more than 11,000 people across West Africa - has abated in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But a new flare-up in Liberia has proved a setback, prompting concern from health experts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The battle can be won, but it requires sustained effort, very careful negotiation with communities and perfection in follow-up of everybody who has been a contact," David Nabarro, the man appointed by the U.N. to coordinate its response, told a media briefing in Cape Town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Under normal circumstances, Nabarro added, an infection rate of 30 people per week would be considered "a major, major outbreak."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Probably about one third of these people are not coming from the contact list, which means they are surprise cases, and that's a big worry," Nabarro earlier told a conference organized by the World Health Organization (WHO).</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Infection rates are down from the peak of the crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Liberia reported a 17-year-old boy tested positive for the virus on June 30 - almost two months after the country was declared free of Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Liberia, the country worst hit by the outbreak, had been hailed as an example for neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone, which are also struggling to stop the spread of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But a report by the U.S. Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) published on Friday found that many Liberians were fearful of survivors and didn't trust health authorities after the epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Respondents to the CDC survey said they feared not seeing their family again if they sought help at an Ebola treatment clinic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Olawale Maiyegun, social affairs director at the African Union Commission, said it appeared communities were forgetting a key "ABC" or "avoid body contact" rule and becoming complacent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Where is the ABC rule? I saw people dancing together, I was alarmed in [Sierra Leone's capital] Freetown," Maiyegun told journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Ebola outbreak has galvanized a global response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Last week donor countries pledged another $3.4 billion in addition to $1.8 billion of unspent money in an effort to eradicate the disease that has wreaked economic and social havoc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>How do Ebola survivors cope with the disease's stigma?</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ebola has killed over 10,000 people in West Africa in the current outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Health body warns of possible measles, whooping cough outbreaks; reportedly delayed Ebola response for political reasons.</td></tr>
