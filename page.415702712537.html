<h3>Robert Durst linked to 1971 missing college student: police</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 71-year old accused killer - who was arrested following an HBO documentary in which he appears to confess he "killed them all" - has been linked to Schulze's disappearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We have been aware of this connection for several years and have been working with various outside agencies as we follow this lead," Middlebury Police Chief Tom Hanley said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The college student, who was 18 when she vanished, was last seen standing across from a health food store owned by Durst on Dec. 10, 1971, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The Lynne Schulze case was reopened in 1992," Hanley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Although technically labeled 'cold,' the case has been continuously generating leads since the investigation was re-opened. We continue to follow up on all leads that we receive in this case."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Durst was arrested in New Orleans for the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman on March 14 - a day before the finale of "The Jinx," an HBO documentary about the New York real estate scion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was denied bail Monday by a New Orleans magistrate judge who said he was a flight risk and danger to others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He has been held in a prison's mental health unit for nearly a week because he is a suicide risk, officials say.</td></tr>
