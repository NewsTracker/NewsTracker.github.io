<h3>Some 11.4 million Americans have enrolled in Obamacare: White House</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, is working. It's working better than we anticipated, certainly working a lot better than many of the critics talked about early on," President Barack Obama said in a video linked to the White House tweet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Administration officials have said they expected 9.1 million people to be enrolled in coverage and up to date on insurance payments by the end of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had predicted 12 million enrollees for 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Last April, the Obama administration announced that more than 8 million people had selected plans for 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But by the end of last year, only 6.7 million were still enrolled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Obamacare's open enrollment period for 2015 began on Nov. 15 and closed on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The White House said there had been a surge of applications in the last nine days of enrollment, particularly on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Sunday, February 15 was the biggest enrollment day ever: more new consumers signed up for health coverage than on any day this open enrollment period or the last," the White House said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The U.S. Health and Human Services Department said on Saturday that a technical problem had prevented some consumers from enrolling but that the issue, involving income verification, was fixed late on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The department said on Saturday that anyone who had been unable to submit an application because income could not be verified due to that problem or any other technical issue would receive an extension for enrollment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Plans for Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, are sold on HealthCare.gov for 37 states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The other 13 states plus Washington, D.C., run their own websites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Obama administration said last week that 2015 Obamacare subsidies were averaging $268 a month for people in the 37 states who had qualified for federal assistance.</td></tr>

<h3>Tyne and Wear man harassed neighbours because they didn't keep their garden perfect</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>John Bushell, 89, whose own garden is his pride and joy, has subjected neighbours to abuse for decades, claiming their inferior properties devalue his.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The retired bookkeeper and neighbour from hell has already had five convictions over his anti-social behaviour and spent time in prison in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This week he was back in court for breaching a restraining order for the tenth time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The targets of his tirade were retired furniture maker Kenneth Mills and his wife Marjorie, both 69, who say they have been abused on numerous occasions since moving beside Bushell in 1970.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In 2012, a court heard how Bushell accused them of living in a 'midden', a 14th century word for a manure dump, and called them 'scumbags'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Monday he appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court where district judge Helen Cousins said: 'Your garden looks very beautiful but you can't behave as you did.' She sentenced him to an eight-week custodial sentence suspended for two years and urged him to move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Yesterday Mr and Mrs Mills described how their lives had been made a misery by living beside Bushell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They have tried repeatedly to put their house on the market but said potential buyers have always been scared off after learning about Bushell's behaviour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bushell claims he cannot sell his house because of the state of neighbouring gardens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr and Mrs Mills said they were first abused shortly after moving to their home in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, while Bushell was first issued with a restraining order in 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In court Bushell's defence claimed his latest verbal onslaught was an 'empty threat' which the pensioner had no intention of carrying out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Charlton Carr told the hearing: 'He is a very house-proud man who likes everything in its place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said the offence was the result of frustration because potential buyers see that neighbouring houses are not as nice, which Bushell believes lowers the value of his property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After the case Bushell, who lives with his wife, said: 'I've taken the house off the market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'Who is going to buy it when you see the state of the gardens around here?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Mills yesterday denied there was any problem with the exterior of his house and said Bushell was using it as an excuse to justify his abuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The grandfather added: 'He has got a lovely garden and looks after his place, but there is nothing wrong with our garden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It is neat and tidy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>'There were occasions when it has got so bad we have thought ''we have to move'' and that's why we have put the house up for sale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But it's a bit late in the day for us to move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>'He goes to court and goes quiet for a time but then you can see him winding up and getting more angry and he does it again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>'My wife was affected by it a few years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>She had panic attacks and took medication for her nerves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>'Twenty years ago it did affect me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>1960- John Bushell moved into detached property in Hebburn and disputes with neighbours begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>They claim he painted a whitewashed wall black and tipped rubbish into their gardens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>1963 - Ken and Marjorie Mills moved into the house next door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>1998 - Bushell issued with an indefinite restraining order to stop him harassing the couple, following an expletive-laden row with them over the garden fence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>2001 - Jailed at Newcastle Crown Court for three months after admitting three charges of harassment against the Mills' and breaching the order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Judge Michael Cartlidge sees secret video made by neighbours, and told him: 'We all love our homes but this is hopeless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>This is not someone with a short fuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>2005 - Breached restraining order again after he nailed a plank of wood to their driveway wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>2006 - Bushell admitted breaching the restraining order twice and threatening to cause criminal damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He was given a three year conditional discharge and fined 150.</td></tr>

<tr><td>36</td><td>2012- In court again after calling his neighbours 'scumbags' in another breach of the restraining order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Given a conditional discharge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>2013 - Prison sentence of two months, suspended for a year, for wasting police time after he pulled down his own guttering and blamed his neighbours for the damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>2015 - Sentenced to eight weeks in prison, suspended for two years, after threatening to burn his neighbours' house down over the state of their garden.</td></tr>
