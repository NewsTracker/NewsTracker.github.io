<h3>Twister kills 10 in Mexico; flash flooding hits Texas</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Twister kills 10 in Mexico; flash flooding hits Texas Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A tornado raged through a Mexico border city early Monday, destroying homes, flinging cars like matchsticks and ripping an infant from its mother's arms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At least 10 people were killed, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In Texas, 12 people were reported missing after flash flooding from a line of storms that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The baby was missing after the twister sent its infant carrier flying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Rescue workers began digging through the rubble of damaged homes for more victims of the tornado that hit Ciudad Acuna, a city of 125,000 across from Del Rio, Texas, shortly after daybreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It hit an area of about seven blocks," said Victor Zamora, interior secretary of the northern state of Coahuila, describing the neighbourhood as "devastated."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Officials confirmed 10 dead, but that number could climb, Zamora said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Photos from the scene showed cars with their hoods ripped off, resting upended against single-story houses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One car's frame was bent around the gate of a house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A bus was seen flipped and crumpled on a roadway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The twister struck around the time buses were preparing to take children to school, Zamora said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The system dumped record rainfall on parts of the Plains and Midwest, spawning tornadoes and causing major flooding that forced at least 2,000 Texans from their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A vacation house in Texas was swept away by a rain-swollen river.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In the U.S., the system was blamed for three deaths Saturday and Sunday, including two in Oklahoma and one in Texas, where a man's body was recovered from a flooded area along the Blanco River, which rose 26 feet in an hour and created huge piles of debris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The line of storms was expected to linger over a large swath of the region Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Among the worst-affected communities were Wimberley and San Marcos, which are in Central Texas along the Blanco River in the increasingly popular corridor between Austin and San Antonio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It looks pretty bad out there," Hays County emergency management co-ordinator Kharley Smith said of Wimberley, where an estimated 350 to 400 homes were destroyed and where three people remained missing late Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We do have whole streets with maybe one or two houses left on them and the rest are just slabs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kristi Wyatt, a spokeswoman for San Marcos, said about 1,000 homes were damaged throughout Hays County, which includes Wimberley and which will be toured Monday by Gov. Greg Abbott.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Five San Marcos police cars were washed away and the fire house was flooded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Rivers swelled so quickly that whole communities awoke Sunday surrounded by water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Blanco crested above 40 feet - more than triple its flood stage of 13 feet - swamping Interstate 35 and forcing parts of the busy north-south highway to close.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Rescuers used pontoon boats and a helicopter to pull people out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>After a surge of mud and water flooded their cottage in Wimberley, John and Valerie Nelson fled through waist-deep waters in darkness early Sunday with transformers sparking and trees crashing around them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The single-story house, which had been Valerie Nelson's grandmother's, had been carefully rebuilt on stilts so that it would be able to withstand even the worst flooding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I'm absolutely dumbfounded," said Valerie Nelson, who has owned the property for about 50 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I didn't think the water would ever get that high."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Hundreds of trees along the Blanco were uprooted or snapped, and they collected in piles of debris that soared 20 feet high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"We've got trees in the rafters," said Cherri Maley, the property manager of a house whose entire rear portion had collapsed with the flooding, carrying away furniture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>About 1,000 residents were evacuated from roughly 400 homes near an earthen dam at Lake Lewis, about 50 miles north of Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Montgomery County emergency management officials fear the dam could fail due to the flooding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Agency spokeswoman Miranda Hahs said it was not clear when residents would be allowed to return home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>A tornado briefly touched down Sunday in Houston, damaging rooftops, toppling trees, blowing out windows and sending at least two people to a hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Fire officials said 10 apartments were heavily damaged and 40 others sustained lesser damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Dallas faced severe flooding from the Trinity River, which was expected to crest near 40 feet Monday and lap at the foundations of an industrial park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The Red and Wichita rivers also rose far above flood stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>This May is already the wettest on record for several Plains cities, with days still to go and more rain on the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Oklahoma City set a new monthly rainfall total this weekend - 18.2 inches through Saturday, surpassing the previous record of 14.5 in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>So far this year, Oklahoma City has gotten 27.37 inches of rain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>It got only 4.29 inches all of last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The recent rainfall may officially end the drought that has gripped the region for years, according to Forrest Mitchell, a meteorologist at the weather service's office in Norman, Oklahoma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He said many lakes and reservoirs are full.</td></tr>
