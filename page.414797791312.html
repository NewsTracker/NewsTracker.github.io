<h3>Russian singer, deputy ministers top new EU sanctions list</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The bloc went ahead with publishing the list despite a ceasefire taking effect over the weekend in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The European Union published a new list of Ukrainians and Russians targeted with sanctions for undermining Ukraine's independence on Monday, including Russian singer Iosif Kobzon and two Russian deputy defense ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The EU's latest list of 19 people and nine organizations hit with asset freezes and travel bans was dominated by Ukrainian separatists with a handful of Russians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The most eye-catching name on the list was that of Kobzon, a singer sometimes dubbed Russia's equivalent of Frank Sinatra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kobzon, 77, also a member of the state Duma or parliament, was listed because he "visited the so-called Donetsk People's Republic and during his visit made statements supporting separatists," according to the EU's Official Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Also named were Russian First Deputy Defense Minister Arkady Bakhin, Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov and Andrei Kartapolov, deputy chief of the general staff of the Russian armed forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The list included armed Ukrainian separatist groups such as the Cossack National Guard, the Sparta Battalion and the Death Battalion and leaders of a number of separatist groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Russia hopes the Minsk agreements on resolving the Ukraine crisis will be abided by, Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov said on Monday, adding that EU sanctions were illegal and prevented the solution of problems in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Our attitude remains the same - sanctions are illegal. They prevent the solution of problems, I mean Ukrainian problems, and hinder the development of relations between the European Union and Russia," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said the situation in eastern Ukraine was developing "not badly" - better than it had been before the meetings in Minsk.</td></tr>
