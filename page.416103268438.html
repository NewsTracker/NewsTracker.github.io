<h3>Bali nine executions: Lawyers deny delay tactics as they lodge Constitutional Court action</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lawyers for the Bali nine pair have denied a challenge filed in the Constitutional Court on Thursday is a tactic to delay the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Attorney-General H. M.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Prasetyo has accused the men's legal team of "playing with justice" and vowed the latest legal action would not affect the timing of the men's deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On the eve of the 10th anniversary of Chan and Sukumaran's arrest in Bali over the attempted trafficking of 8.3 kilograms of heroin to Australia, lawyers arrived at the Constitutional Court with two boxes of documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Lawyer Inneke Kusuma said the men's lawyers would ask the Indonesian government to hold off executing the men until the legal process was complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We are not seeking ways to delay the execution," Ms Kusama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We want to fight for their (the Bali nine duo's) rights ... there is still unfinished process. If the Constitutional Court accepts what we're lodging there may be a new mechanism to consider clemency."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Time appears to be running out for the Australians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Prasetyo this week said he would set a date for the executions when the Supreme Court had ruled on the case review requests made by just two of the other prisoners on death row - Serge Areski Atlaoui of France and Martin Anderson of Ghana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This is despite the fact other prisoners also have outstanding legal cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>However the executions are unlikely to occur in April given the Asian-African conference will be held in Jakarta and Bandung from April 19 to 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It wouldn't look good if you have many guests and you shoot people, although it is legal," Mr Prasetyo said earlier this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However his spokesman, Tony Spontana, later said they could proceed this month if they could find a good day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The Asian-African Conference is one of the considerations. It looks unethical if it is done at the same time," he told Kompas.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ms Kusuma said the Constitutional Court challenge was based on the fact the clemency law did not clearly specify that it was the President's obligation to carry out a thorough assessment when granting or rejecting a clemency application.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The lawyers are also challenging a law that forbids foreigners lodging a case in the Constitutional Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They will argue the constitution states "everyone" has an equal right before the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Sukumaran was arrested on his 24th birthday at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta on April 17, 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Chan was arrested on the same day on a flight headed to Sydney from Denpasar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Chan, who became a minister behind bars, ran cooking and theology classes and helped distribute hygiene packs to fellow prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Sukumaran completed an associate degree in fine arts at Curtin University and was instrumental in the establishment of art and computer graphics classes and a T-shirt printing studio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>However President Joko Widodo failed to take their rehabilitation into account when he rejected their clemency pleas - along with 62 other drug felons - on the basis that Indonesia was facing a drug emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers have become increasingly frustrated that they have been unable to get a court to rule on whether the president should have considered their clemency pleas on an individual basis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The appeal was thrown out of the administrative court this week on the grounds the court did not have the jurisdiction to hear it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Constitutional Court has no power to alter the sentences of Sukumaran and Chan or make any ruling on their case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>However their lawyers hope Indonesian President Joko Widodo will come under political pressure to reassess their pleas for mercy if the court rules that the constitution requires the president to properly consider clemency submissions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>If the Constitutional Court challenge is yet again rejected, Ms Kusuma said: "We will try another effort".</td></tr>
