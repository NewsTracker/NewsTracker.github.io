<li>'Homeland' season 5 addresses ISIS, Charlie Hebdo, Snowden</li>
<li>"I feel like this story is a very fresh story. Its themes, I think, will resonate with people. Charlie Hebdo. (Edward) Snowden. There's interesting elements to this season, and it brings a lot of things together. And as long as they keep it fresh, it's a show that's never the same season after season, and those kinds of shows are the shows that can run."</li>

<li>German spy chief sees reason to thank Snowden</li>
<li>BERLIN (AP) - Germany's domestic intelligence chief said Tuesday that the revelations by Edward Snowden have had at least one positive effect, by raising awareness about the importance of counter-espionage.</li>
<li>Although the reports didn't explicitly cite documents leaked to the media by Snowden, they came amid a flurry of similar claims about alleged U.S. surveillance in Germany that were linked to the former NSA contractor.</li>
