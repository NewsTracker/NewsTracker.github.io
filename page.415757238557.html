<h3>Marlins' Cosart says MLB reviewing his Twitter account (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JUPITER, Fla.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Miami Marlins pitcher Jarred Cosart said Major League Baseball is reviewing his deleted Twitter account as part of an investigation into gambling-related tweets posted there and he is cooperating with the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''Obviously, I was caught off guard by the whole situation,'' Cosart said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The 24-year-old Cosart deleted his Twitter account Tuesday after screen shots of comments he purportedly made appeared on the website of Miami New Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>MLB rules prohibit players and other employees from betting on baseball games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A player who bets on a game not involving his team faces a one-year suspension and a player who bets on or against his own team faces a lifetime ban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The commissioner, at his discretion, can discipline a player for placing other types of bets with an illegal bookmaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Marlins President of Baseball Operations Michael Hill said the club first learned about the tweets from media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''We're fully aware of the investigation,'' Hill said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>FILE - This is a 2015, file photo showing Jarred Cosart of the Miami Marlins baseball team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Cosart deleted his Twitter account following the initial Miami New Times report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said MLB is reviewing other accounts claiming to be his.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Cosart had been scheduled to pitch Friday against Houston, but the right-hander was scratched because of a blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hill said skipping Cosart's turn is ''completely unrelated'' to the MLB investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''We're going to push back his start and get his blister under control,'' Hill said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Cosart was 4-4 with a 2.39 ERA in 10 starts last year for the Marlins, who acquired him from Houston on July 31.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He is 0-2 with an 8.49 ERA in four spring training starts over 11 2-3 innings.</td></tr>
