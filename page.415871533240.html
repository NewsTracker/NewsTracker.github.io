<h3>Apple CEO Tim Cook: New laws enshrine discrimination</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>There's something very dangerous happening in states across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A wave of legislation, introduced in more than two dozen states, would allow people to discriminate against their neighbours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some, such as the bill enacted in Indiana last week that drew a national outcry and one passed in Arkansas, say individuals can cite their personal religious beliefs to refuse service to a customer or resist a state non-discrimination law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Others are more transparent in their effort to discriminate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licences to same-sex couples - even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas' marriage ban later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In total, there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>These bills rationalise injustice by pretending to defend something many of us hold dear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They go against the very principles our nation was founded on, and they have the potential to undo decades of progress toward greater equality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>America's business community recognised a long time ago that discrimination, in all its forms, is bad for business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>At Apple, we are in business to empower and enrich our customers' lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>We strive to do business in a way that is just and fair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That's why, on behalf of Apple, I'm standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation - wherever it emerges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I'm writing in the hopes that many more will join this movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>From North Carolina to Nevada, these bills under consideration truly will hurt jobs, growth and the economic vibrancy of parts of the country where a 21st-century economy was once welcomed with open arms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>I have great reverence for religious freedom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As a child, I was baptised in a Baptist church, and faith has always been an important part of my life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>I was never taught, nor do I believe, that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>I remember what it was like to grow up in the South in the 1960s and 1970s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Discrimination isn't something that's easy to oppose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It doesn't always stare you in the face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It moves in the shadows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And sometimes it shrouds itself within the very laws meant to protect us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Our message, to people around the country and around the world, is this: Apple is open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Regardless of what the law might allow in Indiana or Arkansas, we will never tolerate discrimination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Men and women have fought and died fighting to protect our country's founding principles of freedom and equality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>We owe it to them, to each other and to our future to continue to fight with our words and our actions to make sure we protect those ideals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The days of segregation and discrimination marked by "Whites Only" signs on shop doors, water fountains and restrooms must remain deep in our past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>We must never return to any semblance of that time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>America must be a land of opportunity for everyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>This isn't a political issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It isn't a religious issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>This is about how we treat each other as human beings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Opposing discrimination takes courage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>With the lives and dignity of so many people at stake, it's time for all of us to be courageous.</td></tr>
