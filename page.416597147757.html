<h3>Thousands of police descend on Baltimore to enforce curfew after riots</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE, April 28 (Reuters) - Thousands of police and National Guard troops fanned out across Baltimore on Tuesday night to enforce a new curfew and prevent further violence, while the mayor fended off criticism that she responded sluggishly to a night of rioting, looting and fires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A day after the worst rioting in the United States in years, more than 3,000 police took up posts in front of businesses and hospitals with less than 30 minutes before a citywide 10 p.m. EDT curfew takes effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On Monday, shops were looted, buildings burned to the ground, 20 officers were injured and police arrested more than 250 people in the violence following the funeral of a 25-year-old black man who died in a hospital on April 19 a week after sustaining injuries in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The death of Freddie Gray gave new energy to the public outcry that flared last year after police killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri; New York City and elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Just ahead of the curfew, there were still hundreds people on the streets and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake pleaded with people to go home and police said no exceptions would be made to the curfew except for medical emergencies and work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Let's take our babies home and abide by the curfew. I want to thank you for understanding that we want to bring peace," Rawlings-Blake said through a megaphone on Pennsylvania Avenue, near the scene of Monday night's worst looting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Earlier, as night fell, hundreds of protesters chanted "Black Lives Matter," and there were also scenes of reconciliation, clean-up and even celebration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Near a looted and burned-out CVS pharmacy, hundreds of people waved flags and swayed in the street as they watched 50 dancers gyrating to the drumming of a unity band put together for the evening from music groups from all over the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It feels good to see everyone coming together. People just enjoying themselves," said Roxanne Gaither, 45.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This is what Freddie Gray would have wanted to see. Last night was terrible if a curfew is what it takes to avoid that, so be it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>For nearly a week after Gray died from a spinal injury, protests in Baltimore had been peaceful and Rawlings-Blake said she acted cautiously on Monday to avoid a heavy-handed response that would incite more violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said he had called Rawlings-Blake repeatedly Monday but that she held off requesting the National Guard until three hours after looting started in the largely black city of 620,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The security crisis disrupted the city's daily routines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Schools were closed on Tuesday, but were scheduled to reopen on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In a rare move, the Major League Baseball game between the Baltimore Orioles and Chicago White Sox will be played as scheduled Wednesday but closed to the public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Gray was arrested on April 12 while running from officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He was taken to the police station in a van, with no seat restraint and suffered a spinal injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Six officers have been suspended, and the U.S. Justice Department is investigating possible civil rights violations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"There's no excuse for the kind of violence that we saw yesterday," said President Barack Obama, who said he spoke to the governor and the mayor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It is counterproductive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Obama also said at a news conference the problems in places such as Baltimore were not new and need to be addressed by everyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We can't just leave this to the police," Obama said, adding that "we as a country have to do some soul searching. This is not new. It's been going on for decades."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Almost a quarter of people in Baltimore live below the poverty line and decayed, crime-ridden areas of the city inspired the gritty television police drama "The Wire."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Monday's clashes in Baltimore were reminiscent of rioting in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 after authorities declined to indict a white police officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Police in Ferguson came under intense criticism last year for quickly adopting a militarized posture, using armored vehicles, showing heavy weapons and using tear gas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Baltimore police Captain John Kowalczyk told reporters that the city had prepared for protests by teenagers on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But as the violence increased, older people were involved.</td></tr>
