<h3>Risk of Ebola spreading to other countries appears to lessen: WHO</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The U.N. agency declared in August 2014 that the world's worst Ebola outbreak -- which began in December 2013 -- represented a "public health emergency of international concern" that forced all health officials to shore up defenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The WHO's Emergency Committee, comprising independent experts who held talks on Thursday, was "absolutely firm" in maintaining that view, said Dr. Bruce Aylward, WHO Special Representative for the Ebola Response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"They did note, however, that they believe the risk of international spread appeared to be reducing, this was a result of the work being done in the countries," Aylward told a news briefing at WHO headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He cited control measures and exit screening of travelers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Thirty confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the past week, the smallest number in nearly a year, the WHO said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Liberia reported no cases in the week to April 5, Sierra Leone reported nine and Guinea 21..</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Countries are very much on track of where they want to be ahead of the rainy season," Aylward said, speaking after his return from the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"That is very good news in terms of operations and ability to get this thing finished despite the onset of the rainy season, which is probably a month away."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Emergency Committee experts also strongly recommended that all countries "avoid any unnecessary interference with international trade and transport", Aylward said.</td></tr>
