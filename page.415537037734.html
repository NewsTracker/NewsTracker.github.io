<h3>Secret Service chief asks lawmakers for patience</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a view from the South Lawn on Tuesday, Secret Service patrolled the top of the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WASHINGTON - The new head of the U.S. Secret Service acknowledged Tuesday that days passed before he was told about the latest allegations of misconduct at the agency, but pleaded for patience from skeptical lawmakers calling for stronger action to restore confidence in the protective service after a string of scandals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In testimony before a House panel, agency Director Joseph Clancy said it was unacceptable that it took an anonymous whistleblower for him to learn that two senior agents, allegedly under the influence of alcohol, hit a barricade with a government vehicle March 4 and disrupted an investigation on the White House grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But he also sought to cast the episode as less egregious than reports have suggested, saying the agents nudged the barricade on purpose with their vehicle to move it out of the way, for example, rather than running into it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said he was waiting to discipline the men to avoid impeding an outside probe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This is my first test," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I'm frustrated that we can't act until we get all the facts, but I just don't want to act improperly too soon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Still, members of both parties questioned whether Clancy was the right man for the job, asking why he could not act more quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We've got to have some changes. And you have to be the one to make those changes. And I don't sense at the moment that you have the determination to make that happen," said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Clancy, a 27-year veteran of the Secret Service, was named last month as the permanent head of the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>His appearance before a House Appropriations subcommittee was the first of two on Capitol Hill this week on his agency's budget request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Lawmakers, though, appeared more interested in demanding answers about a string of incidents involving agency personnel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The chairman and the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee have also called Clancy in for a private discussion of the incident, which they have said "exhibits a clear lack of judgment in a potentially dangerous situation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>As the former head of President Obama's security detail, Clancy had earned the president's trust ahead of his new critical assignment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Obama appointed him against the advice of an independent panel that recommended last fall that only an outsider could deliver needed change in the culture of the agency after a series of scandals culminated in a major breach in September, when a Texas man hopped a fence and evaded other layers of security to storm into the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The White House has said it is standing behind Clancy.</td></tr>

<h3>Despite tie, Netanyahu secures shot at 4th term as Israel PM</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israel's election has yielded a fractured parliament and no clear winner, setting up a horse-trading phase that seems likely to leave Netanyahu in his post and place the country on the brink of confrontation with the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It could also force a joint government with moderate challenger Isaac Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And there is the slimmest of chances that Herzog, through machinations, ends up on top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Everything is in the hands of Moshe Kahlon, a relative newcomer to the big leagues of Israeli politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>FILE - In this Tuesday, Feb. 24, 2015 file photo, Moshe Kahlon speaks during a debate hosted by the Israel Women's Network in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Israel's election has yielded a fractured parliament and no clear winner, setting up a horse-trading phase that seems likely to leave Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his post and place the country on the brink of confrontation with the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>FILE - In a Monday, March 16, 2015 file photo, Israeli leader of the center-left Zionist Union Isaac Herzog speaks with Israeli voters persuading them to vote for him in the upcoming Israeli elections in his party headquarters in Tel Aviv, Israel, a day ahead of legislative elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's parliament election ended in a deadlock, according to TV exit polls, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to hold the advantage ahead of coalition talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Here is a look at how the main players fared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Netanyahu's Likud Party came from behind after trailing in the polls to pull roughly even with its main rival, the center-left Zionist Union led by Isaac Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The comeback, fueled by an aggressive appeal to his hard-line base, gave Netanyahu a strong shot at securing a fourth term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Both he and Herzog now compete for a chance to form a coalition that commands a majority in the 120-seat parliament, a complicated task in Israel's fractured political landscape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some say Netanyahu has a better chance than Herzog of cobbling together a government, by courting his "natural allies," rightist and religious parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Herzog would have to appeal to more ideologically diverse allies, including hard-liners and religious parties, and perhaps Arab parties, to build a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Kahlon, the 54-year-old leader of an upstart centrist party, Kulanu, is seen as the kingmaker of the inconclusive elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>With his party's predicted 10 seats, according to TV exit polls, Kahlon would have a decisive say in who becomes the next prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Kahlon has said his main objective is to become Israel's next finance minister in order to carry out economic reforms and lower the cost of living.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Kahlon hasn't said whom he favors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He has deep political roots in the Likud but fell out with Netanyahu two years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>This unprecedented union of four largely Arab-backed factions became Israel's third largest party - with 13 seats, according to exit polls - and gave Israel's Arab minority significant leverage in parliament for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Party leader Ayman Odeh said Tuesday that the Joint List will try to prevent the formation of a Netanyahu-led government, but will not join a Herzog-run coalition - to avoid having to be party to decisions on possible military campaigns or building more Jewish settlements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In the event of a Netanyahu-Herzog unity government, the Joint List expects to take on the high profile role of leader of the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>When Netanyahu called early elections three months ago, Herzog and his Labor Party were seen as politically too weak to mount an effective challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Herzog confounded expectations, rising in the polls after joining forces with former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and her centrist Tnuah party to form an alliance they called the Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Despite his quiet demeanor and perceived lack of charisma, Herzog emerged as a credible candidate for prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He has a long shot at the top job, if he can persuade Kahlon to back him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Netanyahu's ultra-nationalist foreign minister last year promoted legislation raising the vote threshold for parties getting into parliament - and almost became a victim of his own initiative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Lieberman's Israel Beitenu barely crossed the threshold with five seats, according to exit polls, a sharp drop from the 2013 election when his joint list with Likud won 31 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Despite his hawkish views, Lieberman hasn't said if he will endorse Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A deal with Israel on the terms of Palestinian statehood remains at the core of Abbas' political strategy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In the final stretch of the campaign, Netanyahu vowed to prevent the creation of such a state on his watch, going back on long-standing promises to the international community and the Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>If Netanyahu wins another term, Abbas would have to acknowledge that his strategy has failed and likely be pushed into a more confrontational approach toward Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Herzog has said he wants to resume negotiations with the Palestinians, but would likely be constrained by a diverse coalition and not be able to take risky decisions required in any peace deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has become increasingly strained, particularly after the Israeli leader openly challenged the president's efforts to negotiate a deal on curbing Iran's nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>If Netanyahu secures another term, the two leaders would have to find a way to work together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>A decisive victory by Israel's center-left camp would have made it easier for Obama to push for a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.</td></tr>
