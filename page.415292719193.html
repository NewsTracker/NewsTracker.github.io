<h3>Apple Watch Edition Will Not Be Worth Its Weight In Gold, But Could Start At $2,999</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Rumors have pegged that price to range between $5,000 and $20,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Not a lot, perhaps, compared to a gold Rolex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But a 20-year-old Rolex will still tell the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Who knows how functional the first Apple Apple Watch will be in five years?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There is now a new development in the pricing story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A new Apple patent has surfaced for a "Method and Apparatus for forming a gold metal matrix composite."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In simple terms, this new "Apple gold" is lighter, stronger and more scratch-resistant than ordinary 18 karat gold through alloys of low-density ceramic particles instead of precious metals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It also contains roughly half the amount of pure 24 karat gold as ordinary 18 karat gold (which is 75% gold, 15% silver, and 10% copper).</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The math is all explained in geeky detail on a blog called All This.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>How much actual gold will be in the Apple Watch Edition?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>For the models on Apple's current Edition page, the answer is about half an ounce (current value $640).</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>What Apple isn't showing on this page is a gold Edition with a solid gold link bracelet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This bracelet only appears in stainless steel on the Apple Watch Collection page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It is not an unreasonable assumption that Apple will roll out a gold link bracelet Edition, which could add another full ounce of gold (total current value $1,920).</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Still, with John Gruber of Daring Fireball estimating a price range of $10,000-$20,000 for the Edition, the profit margins start looking a little rich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Marco Arment is calling it at $5,000, but he is not talking about a solid gold bracelet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In the fine jewelry business, it is not uncommon for the retail price to be between five and ten times the cost of the raw materials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>(see this analysis from Apple Spotlight on how much Tiffany customers pay for "form."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Apple reported in September that the profit margin for the entry level iPhone 6 was 69%, and slightly higher for the pricier models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>That iPhone 6 costs Apple $216 to make, according to a teardown published in Re/code.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Let's assume that the basic Apple Watch will cost Apple no more than that, considering that it's retail prices is supposed to start at $349.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>That would have the total cost to Apple for the Apple Watch Edition (without the gold link bracelet) at less than $1,000 and the model with the bracelet just above $2,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The economics of the "Apple gold" could allow pricing with iPhone-level profit margins to be $2,999 and $6,999 respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>For those expecting price points of $5,000 and $10,000, or $10,000 and $20,000, this "reasonable" pricing would be a welcome surprise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>As surprising as it is that the high-end Edition could contain so little actual gold, this is not at all a bad thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Not only will this new process make the Apple Watch Edition lighter for delicate wrists and more resiliant, but it also might help the cause of (relatively) affordable luxury that Apple has championed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>More significantly, this level of innovation in manufacturing follows through on Apple's commitment to using fewer resources in its products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>And since the mining of gold involves a lot of dangerous and underregulated human labor, it's a win in an area that Apple has taken a lot of heat about for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>From the investor point of view, if the gold Apple Watch is a hit like the iPhone 6 Plus has been, the money saved on gold will add meaningfully to Apple's already healthy bottom line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Update: As reader Michal Kvasnica points out, the Apple Watch Edition will literally be worth its weight in gold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>My original headline was intended rhetorically, not literally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Apple can claim its new gold metal matrix composite is 18 karat because it will be 75% solid gold by weight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The overall weight per volume is where Apple has achieved the savings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The low-density ceramic particles represent a surprising proportion of the volume of the material but still only contribute 25% to the weight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Since no one will buy an Apple Watch Edition with the intention of melting it down for gold, the real point is that "Apple gold" is great from an engineering perspective but bad in terms of intrinsic value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Passing the savings along to the (already overpaying) consumer reinforces Apple's affordable luxury brand promise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>A $10,000 starting price, in my opinion, would be abusing that promise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>What Would A $19,999 Apple Watch Mean For The Future Of Pricing Elasticity?</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Simple Vs. Splashy: Can Pebble Time Beat Apple Watch On Your Wrist?</td></tr>

<h3>Kin mark MH370 anniversary with vow to never give up</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Families of the 239 people on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 on Sunday marked the anniversary of the plane's disappearance, vowing to never give up on the desperate search for wreckage and answers to the world's biggest aviation mystery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Several dozen relatives gathered at the main Buddhist temple in central Beijing, some of them wearing T-shirts reading "Never Give Up. Search On."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A swarm of security closely watched the relatives and stopped them from entering the sprawling grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Since the plane's disappearance, Chinese security have tightened their watch over the relatives, especially after some began criticizing the Chinese government's response to the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We want to show our determination," said Jiang Hui, whose mother was aboard the flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We are here to pray for our loved ones and we hope they can come back and the truth will come out as soon as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She said that without concrete evidence she and other relatives will never accept the conclusion of the Malaysian authorities that the passengers are dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In Kuala Lumpur, Voice 370, a support group for the kin of those on board, will host a "Day of Remembrance" at a mall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Later Sunday, the Malaysian government will release an interim investigation report, a requirement under international civil aviation regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Although no wreckage has been found, officials in Australia, Malaysia and China, the three countries leading the search effort, say they are still optimistic the plane will be found in the southern Indian Ocean where they suspect it crashed after deviating from a flight to Beijing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Grace Subathirai Nathan, whose mother Anne Daisy was on the plane, said Sunday's events were important "to highlight to the public that we still don't have any answers and that we must pursue the search."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear," Malaysian Prime Minster Najib Razak said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Together with our international partners, we have followed the little evidence that exists. Malaysia remains committed to the search, and hopeful that MH370 will be found."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China, where most of the passengers came from, said his government will provide "all needed service to every next of kin" and help uphold their "legitimate and lawful rights and interests."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"A year has passed, the plane has not been located, but the search effort will continue," he told a news conference in Beijing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Today must be a difficult day for the next of kin ... Our hearts are with you."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In late January, Malaysia's government formally declared Flight 370's disappearance an accident and said all 239 people on board were presumed dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The statement was meant to pave the way for compensation claims, but it angered many relatives who deemed it to be premature without any physical evidence of the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Many relatives also believe there is a conspiracy behind the disappearance and that their loved ones are alive, which the airline is hiding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Since last March 8, nothing has changed, nothing has been found. Every day they just lie and trick the families. I feel only hatred now. Not even suffering, just hatred," said a woman at the Beijing temple, who would identify herself only by her family name Li.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Her daughter was on the flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I want to tell the next of kin that I am also looking for the answers," Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told reporters Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Our priority now is on the search ," he said, adding that if nothing is found by the end of May, "then we will have to go back to the drawing board" and come up with a new plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He said the safety investigation team will release its interim report later Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Officials said it will detail the facts but is unlikely to touch on the cause of the tragedy.</td></tr>
