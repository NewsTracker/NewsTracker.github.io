<h3>Illinois teen admits to stealing guns to sell in Ferguson, Missouri</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CHICAGO (Reuters) - A southern Illinois teen pleaded guilty on Wednesday to federal firearms charges in a plot to sell guns and loot businesses in Ferguson, Missouri, which had been the site of sometimes violent protests over a fatal police shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dakota Moss, 19, of Centralia, admitted in federal court to burglarizing a farm and home supply store and stealing 39 guns in November of last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Moss and a juvenile accomplice stole the guns in order to sell them in Ferguson, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The two also had planned to participate in rioting and looting of businesses in the Ferguson area, though they never went through with it, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the early morning hours of Nov. 29, 2014, Moss and his accomplice used a pickup truck stolen from Centralia High School to ram the locked security gate at the Buchheit store and broke out store windows to get inside, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The two were armed and intended to shoot anyone who interrupted the burglary, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Centralia Police and agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives identified the suspects soon after the burglary and have recovered 37 of the 39 stolen guns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Moss faces up to 40 years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Moss is facing a longer time in prison than the time he has been on this earth, and for good reason: this was potentially a horribly violent crime which could have led to massive numbers of deaths," said U.S. Attorney Stephen Wigginton of the Southern District of Illinois.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Moss was convicted of stealing firearms, possession of stolen firearms, being a felon in possession of firearms, and carry and use of a firearm during a violent crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He will be sentenced on July 31.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Centralia is about 72 miles east of Ferguson, where protests and looting erupted following the August police shooting of black teenager Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Moss' accomplice is in the custody of the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice, according to the St. Louis Post Dispatch.</td></tr>
