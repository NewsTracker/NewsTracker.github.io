<h3>Fashion's greatest hits, misses on the Cannes red carpet</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cannes' red carpet can be as kind as it is cruel when it comes to fashion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>For 12 days, major Hollywood actresses such as Marion Cotillard, Emily Blunt, Naomi Watts and Sienna Miller graced the film festival's red carpet in clothes designed by the world's greatest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yet while the best looks come to define the festival, there's almost as much interest in who got it wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Here are the 68th Cannes Film Festival's fashion hits and misses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Blunt has Stella McCartney to thank for her shimmering coup at the "Sicario" premiere, alongside costars Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Embroidered jewels gave the sophisticated, covered-up look a weight that oozed old-school Hollywood glamour yet sparkled with sporty simplicity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>German model Toni Garrn looked every part the princess at the premiere of "The Little Prince" - bringing a touch of little mermaid to the Cannes red carpet in a sparkly, swanky silver gown with bare shoulders and a crossover cutaway midriff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Garrn, alongside a ravishing Jourdan Dunn in black Ralph & Russo couture, upstaged the film's bigger star, Marion Cotillard, who wore a powder blue Dior that creased clumsily at the midriff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It was not Cotillard's strongest year in the fashion parade - but the Dior brand ambassador fared well in a blue-and-rose truncated minidress from Dior's haute couture spring-summer 2015 collection at the premiere of director Justin Kurzel's "Macbeth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She sparkled alongside co-star Michael Fassbender, thanks to the outfit's myriad of embroidered pailettes and jewels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Oscar-winner, who's known for her fashion-forward style, bucked the trend for classical va-va-voom and voluminous dresses that were popular this year at Cannes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Model-of-the-minute Kendall Jenner impressed critics with her bold Alaia look at the premiere of Paolo Sorrentino's "Youth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 19-year-old pulled off a difficult look - a billowing skirt and an exposed midriff - with panache.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She accessorized the look with Alaia gladiator sandals and a diamond bib necklace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Another model with style success was Lara Stone who turned up for the "Youth" premiere in a sexy, granite Atelier Versace couture dress with a V-neck cut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The shimmering petrol color contrasted stylishly with her white-blond hair and soft makeup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Jury member Miller had a cinematic comeback this year - after roles in "American Sniper" and "Foxcatcher" - but it was an off year for her on the Cannes red carpet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Misses included an oversize, shapeless black look by Sonia Rykiel at the "Carol" premiere, and a beige layered gown that some compared to curtains at the "MacBeth" premiere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Model Irina Shayk got attention for all the wrong reasons when she arrived for the "Sicario" screening in a garish, gold Atelier Versace dress with a split leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The dress's huge shimmering train and gold strip detailing jarred with the other premiere attendees who opted for more subtle styles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It was a mixed bag for Oscar-nominee Watts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She thrilled at the Cannes Film Festival opening in a beautiful powder gray gown by Oscar de la Renta, with diaphanous embroidered feathers on the skirt and glittering jewels on the revealing bodice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But she appeared later in a dubious black gown by Peter Pilotto that had an uneven skirt at "The Sea of Trees."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Natalie Portman's directorial debut "A Tale of Love and Darkness" did not fare well with critics, nor did the rather mature-looking, limp Rodarte dress she wore to the film's photo call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The asymmetrical skirt looked off-kilter with the symmetry of the upper part.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Actress Charlotte Vandermeersch raised eyebrows on the red carpet for her "The Little Prince" outfit, a mismatched ensemble of bright blue pants and a black top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>There was little right with the look - from the garish sheer zones near her bust to the oversized harem pants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>FILE- In this May 16, 2015 file photo, actress Naomi Watts poses for photographers during a photo call for the film The Sea of Trees, at the 68th international film festival, Cannes, southern France.</td></tr>
