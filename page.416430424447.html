<h3>Kenya: 9 security chiefs suspended over al-Shabab attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - Kenya's interior minister says he has suspended nine security chiefs in the eastern town of Garissa during a probe to determine if they failed to stop an extremist attack earlier this month in which 148 people died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Joseph Nkaissery said a thorough investigation is needed to determine if the individual officers are criminally culpable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nkaissery and the Police Inspector General Wilson Boinnet have come under heavy criticism for flying to Garissa University College, the scene of the April 2 attack, instead giving those flights to members of the police tactical team that ended the siege hours later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Al-Shabab extremists from Somalia claimed responsibility for the university attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Al-Shabab has vowed to carry out attacks on Kenya for deploying troops to fight the extremist group.</td></tr>
