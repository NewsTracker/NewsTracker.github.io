<h3>Japanese Ebola test gives results in 11 minutes: researcher</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The breakthrough by Nagasaki University's Institute of Tropical Medicine will allow medics to move much more quickly in treating people with the haemorrhagic fever, Professor Jiro Yasuda told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The result time was unexpectedly short," said Yasuda of the trial conducted in Guinea last month on 100 samples, of which 47 proved positive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Guinean government has now asked the institute and its collaboration partner Toshiba to supply equipment to roll out the test, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The test hinges on what the researchers have called a "primer", a substance that amplifies only those genes specific to the Ebola virus found in a blood sample or other bodily fluid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Using existing techniques, ribonucleic acid (RNA) -- biological molecules used in the coding of genes -- is extracted from any viruses present in a sample.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This is then used to synthesise the viral DNA, which can be mixed with the primer and then heated to 60-65 degrees Celsius (140-149 Fahrenheit).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>If Ebola is present, DNA specific to the virus is amplified by the action of the primers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The by-products from the process cause the liquid to become cloudy, providing visual confirmation, Yasuda said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Currently, a method called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is used to detect the Ebola virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This requires doctors to heat and cool samples repeatedly and takes at least 90 minutes, sometimes up to two hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Ebola virus, transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids, has killed more than 10,000 people in western Africa since it re-emerged in December 2013.</td></tr>
