<h3>Brick business booms as Nepal readies to rebuild after quake</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this Wednesday, May 13, 2015 photo, Indian and Nepalese laborers work at a brick factory in Bhaktapur, Nepal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nepal, facing billions in reconstruction costs, has appealed for foreign governments and agencies to help with aid and funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Almost 745,600 buildings and homes have been damaged or destroyed, including at least 87,700 in the capital, according to Nepal's emergency authority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Engineers say only 40 percent of Kathmandu's damaged buildings as habitable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The worn-out workers of Jaya Mayaswori Brick Factory are packing clay and hauling loads with a new sense of purpose - helping to rebuild Nepal after a series of massive earthquakes and aftershocks ravaged the Himalayan nation, leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There is urgency to the back-breaking work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nepal was crippled by last month's magnitude-7.8 earthquake, which killed more than 8,000, while a string of strong aftershocks has further terrified the survivors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The capital of Kathmandu is in shambles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Entire villages are flattened into rubble and dust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And many businesses have shut down, leaving survivors scrambling for income.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The brick factories clustered in Bhaktapur, a town on the outskirts of Kathmandu, are some of the few businesses still running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>For the owners and workers who have not fled back to their villages, that means there is still a chance of earning daily wages and profits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I am making my contribution in the rebuilding our country by making these bricks," said 17-year-old Barsa Pun Magar, who joined the factory six months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"There has been so much destruction," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Every brick is going to help bring the country and people back on their feet."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Though many of the factories have also been damaged, with kiln towers toppled and workers' housing destroyed, those who remain are laboring overtime before the anticipated rush for construction materials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In a few weeks, monsoon will arrive and create impassable mud swamps, trigger landslides and pummel the tarpaulin tents providing shelter to many across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"There is definitely going to be a big demand for bricks in the next few months as people start to rebuild," factory owner Shree Bhakta Sukhupayo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He expects the price of bricks to go up, from a pre-quake level of about 17 U.S. cents to as much as 25 cents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But he insists he will not profit from the tragedy by raising his prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We have faced a big loss in the earthquake, we are also victims," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We hope the government will bring programs that could help businesses like ours."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Nepal faces billions in reconstruction costs, and has appealed for foreign governments and agencies for help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Brick-making is grueling work, involving packing clay into rectangular lumps, firing them in kilns and hauling them to enormous stacks awaiting transport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The hours are also long - sometimes 12 hours a day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But the workers, many with family in shattered villages, are also racing against time and weather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>With Nepal's needs so vast, and its future prospects uncertain, many are doing overtime because it's the only job they can get.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I have to work to feed my family," said Kalu Ram Bika, 37, who sends some of the money he earns to his parents in their village in southern Nepal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"We work. We get fed. It does not matter how bad the situation is. We have to work."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In this Wednesday, May 13, 2015 photo, a Nepalese laborer carries a load of bricks at a brick factory in Bhaktapur, Nepal.</td></tr>
