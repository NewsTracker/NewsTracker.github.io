<tr><td>8</td><td>The charges indicate that both confessed their plans to FBI agents after their arrest Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It was unclear late Monday which lawyers were representing the two.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>The charge indicates that undercover FBI agents interacted online with Young beginning in May about her desire to travel to Syria to join the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The charge states that her Twitter page said the only thing keeping her from traveling to Syria was her need to earn money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I just want to be there," she is quoted as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In later conversations peppered with Arabic phrases, she said she planned a "nikkah," or Islamic marriage to Dakhlalla so they could travel without a chaperone under Islamic law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In June, the first FBI agent passed Young off to a second FBI agent posing as an Islamic State facilitator.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>Young specified her skills with math and chemistry and said she and Dakhlalla would like to be medics treating the injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Later, the charge says, she told the second FBI agent that Dakhlalla could help with the Islamic State's Internet media, saying he "really wants to correct the falsehoods heard here" and the "U.S. media is all lies when regarding" the group, which she called by its preferred internal name, Dawlah.</td></tr>
