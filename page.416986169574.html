<h3>US delivers Humvees, patrol boat to Tunisia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The United States announced on Thursday the delivery of 52 Humvee military vehicles and a patrol boat to help Tunisia counter jihadist violence and ward off the insecurity of neighbouring Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 52 HMMWVs aim "to improve force mobility" of the Tunisian army, the US embassy in Tunis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It also announced the delivery of a 65-foot (20-metre) patrol boat, the first of four to be supplied in the coming year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"These vessels will join a fleet of 22 other US-manufactured boats... delivered since 2013," the embassy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The United States is pleased to support these efforts and help Tunisia on its pathway to a secure future," it said, without specifying if the deliveries were aid or a commercial transaction.</td></tr>
