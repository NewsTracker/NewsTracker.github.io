<h3>A Georgian region is fertile ground for Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this April 7, 2015 photo a relative shows a photo of Muslim Kushtanashvili, left on the screen, in a house in the village of Duisi, about 70 km (43 miles) north of Tbilisi, in the Pankisi Gorge, Georgia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As many as 200 young men have gone to fight in Syria from Georgia's Pankisi Gorge, the native region of Islamic State commander Omar al Shishani.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Last September, the U.S. Treasury Department placed Omar al Shishani on its list of "specially designated global terrorists."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But to some in the Pankisi, the mountainous region of northeastern Georgia where he was born in 1986, the ginger-bearded commander is a hero and a role model.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>BIRKIANI, Georgia (AP) - In the summer of 2012, a former Georgian Army corporal who had served prison time for illegal possession of ammunition burned his photo albums and quit his native village.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tarkhan Batirashvili had wanted to become a policeman, but couldn't get hired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Now, this offspring of a Christian father and a Muslim mother was about to start a new chapter in his military career - one in which he would be credited with some of Islamic State's most stunning battlefield victories and rise to senior rank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Last September, the U.S. Treasury Department placed Batirashvili - who now calls himself Omar al Shishani and is believed by some to be Islamic State's chief of military operations - on its list of "specially designated global terrorists."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>To follow the path he blazed, as many as 200 of his young countrymen have left their villages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Batirashvili's father Temur is aghast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's monstrous what's going on in the valley, that they are deceiving these kids and they're leaving to fight in a foreign land," the 72-year-old man told visitors to his one-story stone house in the hamlet of Birkiani.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"My son should not be in Syria."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Pankisi is home to an estimated 5,000-7,000 descendants of Muslim Chechens who settled here in the 19th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the village of Omalo, locals say, a green-tile roofed building is used by preachers from the Wahhabi branch of Sunni Islam to enlist volunteers for jihad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Residents say the recruiters promise money and provide ground transportation to Tbilisi airport more than 120 miles (200 km) away, as well as prepaid plane tickets to Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On April 2, her 16-year-old grandson Muslim Kushtanashvili and schoolmate Ramzan Bagakashvili, 18, joined the valley's recruits to Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That Thursday, the teens left as usual for their school in Omalo, next door to the building used by the Wahhabis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They never came home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Muslim called friends later to say he was in Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Then word came back the 10th grader had crossed into Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A legal minor, Muslim also had no passport, so his family can't understand why Georgian border guards let him fly out of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Interior Minister Vakhtang Gomelauri has vowed an investigation and punishment for those responsible, but Muslim's family suspect authorities are protecting the recruiters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Bagakashvili's mother agrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Here they are stirring up things, recruiting youths," Tina Alkhanashvili said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"You can't get authorities to watch them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Within weeks, Georgian officials reported three more boys from the valley had disappeared.</td></tr>
