<h3>At least 14 dead in Kenya attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility Tuesday for a nighttime attack on two homes in northeastern Kenya's Mandera County.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The attack killed at least 14 people and injured 11 others, according to Mandera County Commissioner Alex Nkoyo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The compound housed primarily quarry workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The attack began around 1 a.m. when a group of men using a variety of weapons attacked the compound, Nkoyo told CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The commissioner said an explosive device -- something other than a hand grenade -- was used to blow open a gate to the compound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The attackers then entered and started shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Many people were sleeping outside to escape the heat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>When the attack began, those who were able to do so ran inside the houses, followed by the gunmen, Nkoyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Those killed were local laborers and workers from other parts of Kenya, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A woman, identified as the landlady of the compound, was also among the dead, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Judging by the number of bullets at the attack site, Nkoyo said, the estimated number of attackers was 10 to 15, with more as backup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The commissioner said local security forces responded within 10 minutes, and as their vehicles approached, the attackers dispersed into the bush and surrounding villages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some may have crossed the border into Somalia, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mandera County borders Somalia and Ethiopia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Nkoyo said Mandera has been under heightened security since attacks there last year on a bus that killed at least 28 people and on a quarry, where 36 people were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Al-Shabaab's military operations spokesman, Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab, said Tuesday's attack had killed more than a dozen people whom he described as Kenyan Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Al-Shabaab is an Islamic terrorist group that operates primarily in Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The attack was part of Al-Shabaab's Ramadan offensive against Kenya, said the spokesman, speaking on Al-Shabaab's main broadcaster, Radio Andalus.</td></tr>
