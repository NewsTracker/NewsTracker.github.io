<h3>Hockey news: Canterbury men survive relegation battle, Holcombe set for play-off finale</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>&#x201c;We've achieved one of our goals for the season but we still have plenty to go,&#x201d; said Sarah Haycroft, their skipper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Holcombe lead Reading by one point in the race for the final play off spot after losing at Canterbury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However Holcombe face Surbiton away on Saturday knowing that defeat will let in Reading, who host Leicester.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mel Clewlow&#x2019;s first-half penalty corner goal proved enough to give Canterbury the win and move them up to second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Reading kept their bid alive with a 2-0 win at Buckingham, thanks to strikes from Georgie Blackwood and Kate Richardson-Walsh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The University of Birmingham are also still in with a chance of fourth after drawing 1-1 with Clifton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Aileen Davis gave the Bristol side the lead in the 22nd minute, before Hannah Martin levelled for the visitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Relegated Beeston beat Leicester 3-2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the men's Premier Division, Canterbury staved off relegation in a final day battle of the bottom two with a 2-1 victory, as Southgate were condemned to conference hockey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Wei Adams gave Canterbury a first-half lead before Mexican Francisco Montoya, the only player from the Americas in the top flight, doubled their advantage after the break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was far from easy though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Southgate's Darren Cheesman halved the deficit with 17 minutes remaining and were then awarded a penalty corner in the last minute, which they failed to convert.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Canterbury, who won four of their final five matches, will now go into a play-off next month at Lee Valley with the top three from the Conference leagues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Meanwhile, Surbiton needed to overturn a goal difference deficit of four to pip East Grinstead to top spot and earn a place by right in next season&#x2019;s EuroHockey League.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But East Grinstead's goalscoring feats continued - they finished with 77 goals from 18 games - as Chris Griffiths, the Great Britain forward, netted a fine hat-trick in a 4-1 win over Reading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Surbiton duly beat Brooklands Manchester University 6-3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Alan Forsyth scored a hat-trick to finish on 18 goals for the season, seven behind team-mate Matt Daly.</td></tr>
