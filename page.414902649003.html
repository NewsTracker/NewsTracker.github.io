<h3>European jihadis unable to join Islamic State, locked at home</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Fighters in Syria and Iraq contacted by Reuters said the impact was limited on the battlefield since European fighters make up only a fraction of the forces of Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Now most of the (foreign) fighters are coming from Asian countries, like Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. They are tough fighters," an Islamic State militant who fought with the group in both Syria and Iraq, told Reuters via the internet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some also said that restrictions might backfire on European countries when jihadis who are prevented from traveling to the Middle East are encouraged to wage individual attacks at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>European countries are working hard to reduce recruitment by the group, sometimes referred to by the acronyms ISIS or ISIL, which has seized wide swathes of Iraq and Syria and is now the target of a U.S.-led campaign of air strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The group takes pride in having attracted fighters from across the globe, including thousands from Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Western countries fear that some European fighters could return home and carry out attacks in their native countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The presence of European fighters drew particular attention in the West last year when a man with a British accent appeared in videos of British and American prisoners being beheaded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>European countries have arrested people for recruiting for Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Several have passed laws allowing travel documents to be seized from those who travel to fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One Syrian supporter of the group said such measures were a sign that its importance was being recognized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"At first these countries took us lightly, they thought the fighters will come here and die. But what they did not see coming was that they get trained and also started to contact their friends and relatives to join," said the Syrian supporter who lives in an Islamic State-held territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Islamic State is now stretched, waging battles on several fronts in both Iraq and Syria while trying to administer areas under its control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Fighters proclaiming loyalty to the group also have emerged in several countries including Libya and Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Several members said the group fields 60,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria, mostly local Sunni Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>About 550 German citizens have joined fighting in Syria and about 180 are believed to have returned, German officials have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Germany plans to seize personal identity cards of would-be jihadis for up to three years according to a draft law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>France has cracked down since mid-2014, ramping up a campaign after new anti-terrorism laws were passed by parliament late last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>French officials estimate that about 400 French citizens are in Syria, 180 have returned to France, 200 want to go and 200 are somewhere in Europe trying to get there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>British officials think some 600 people have gone to fight, with 300 now returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Police can now seize the passports of nationals trying to leave the country for up to 30 days, and can temporarily prevent citizens suspected of involvement with Islamic State from re-entering Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This important legislation will disrupt the ability of people to travel abroad to fight and then return," Home Secretary Theresa May said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Despite the crackdown, the group continues to receive fresh fighters through neighboring countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Several jihadi sources said that traveling through Turkey remains the main route.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Turkey has responded to strong criticism from Western allies alarmed at the flow of fighters into Syria by ramping up border controls, officials and diplomats have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>This month the Turkish army said at least 19 people intent on joining Islamic State had been detained close to the frontier, including 13 foreigners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The impression we have is that Turkey has tightened things up," one western diplomat told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Anti-Islamic State activists inside Syria say there has been tension among the group with some members, mainly foreigners, fleeing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Fighters deny this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"The (foreigners) are not leaving the State. In two months in Baiji we received 180. In one of the training camps here forty percent of the fighters are foreigners," said a fighter who is now based in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Baiji, site of Iraq's biggest oil refinery, has been one of the main battlefields between fighters and Iraqi government forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The group has had its eyes on Europe since it first appeared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In many of its videos, fighters declare that one of its targets is "Rome", by which they mean Christian Europe generally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It is now encouraging what it calls "lone wolves" to carry out attacks inside Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"If they cannot come here they still fight these infidels inside the countries they live in," a fighter who gave his name as Bakr said.</td></tr>

<h3>If White Dudes Were Erased From Oscar Movies</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Equally awesome: Zero female directors, screenwriters, or cinematographers were nominated, and according to Women's Media Center, among the 184 nominees across 19 non-acting categories, only 35 are women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And so the Academy Award goes white dudes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This stark imbalance in both racial and gender diversity in Hollywood is manifested visually on the posters that represent the biggest films of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>More often than not, white men are selected as the representatives for the movies they star in, even when they have equally signifigant female costars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>To illustrate "Gone Girl," Ben Affleck is more prominently pictured, despite the fact that the Gone Girl in question is the driving force behind the plot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The main poster for "Interstellar" only shows Matthew McConaughey, and wasn't "Boyhood" as much about the women in the movie as the male characters?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Hollywood landscape is even bleaker for women of color.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>There have been just nine black women nominated for the Best Actress Oscar in over 85 years, which could explain why you'd be hard-pressed to find a movie poster displaying a black woman's face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>So, HuffPost Women imagined what it would look like if *gasp* white men didn't exist on these posters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Story continues below images.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs -- notably the first black person in her position -- denies that the academy has a problem recognizing diversity, but the demographics of the organization's members tell a different story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>According to a 2012 LA Times study, Oscar voters are nearly 94 percent white and 77 percent male, with a median age of 62.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Those numbers certainly don't mirror the composition of those who actually see movies -- women have made up a larger share of moviegoers since 2009, and while whites are the largest racial group who see movies in theaters at least once a year, the gap has decreased over the last five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>April Reign, a lawyer who created the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, doesn't blame Hollywood's overwhelming whiteness solely on the Academy, but rather the structure in place that allows for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The Oscars are white and male because the movies are white and male. The movies are white and male because the directors and producers are white and male. The directors and producers are white and male because the studio heads are white and male," she told The Huffington Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>If we want to see different faces on movie posters, and a diverse crowd of people on stage Sunday night during the Oscar ceremony itself, "The mindset about who should play these parts, about who should direct these films, about who should write the screenplays, must be changed," Reign said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In a scathing December op-ed for The Hollywood Reporter, comedian Chris Rock elaborated on how that current framework enables Hollywood to remain mostly white and mostly male.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"When it comes to casting, Hollywood pretty much decides to cast a black guy or they don't. We're never on the 'short list.' We're never 'in the mix.' ... I never heard anyone go, 'Is it going to be Amy Adams or Gabrielle Union?'" he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"You can go to whole movies and not see one black woman... I go to the movies almost every week, and I can go a month and not see a black woman having an actual speaking part in a movie. That's the truth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Of course, jobs, and therefore nominations, should be based on merit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But until opportunities for the former, and subsequently the latter, include faces of all types, audiences who long for more diversity will continue to be disappointed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"'Birdman' was a great film and Michael Keaton was great in it," Reign said, "but when the producers and studio heads were thinking about how to cast it, did Andy Garcia come up in those conversations? Was Ken Watanabe's name mentioned? Did someone call Dennis Haysbert's agent?... the movie could have easily been called 'Birdwoman' and Sandra Bullock or Demi Moore could have shined in the role."</td></tr>
