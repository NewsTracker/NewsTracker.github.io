<h3>Real estate heir Robert Durst arrested in New Orleans</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bizarre real estate heir and longtime murder suspect Robert Durst was arrested on murder charges Saturday based on evidence from an HBO documentary series in which he blabbed about himself, sources told The Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He then compounded his mistake in the show's final episode on Sunday when he made what appeared to be a confession into a microphone he apparently did not realize was live, saying, "What the hell did I do? . . . Killed them all of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Durst, 71, was busted Saturday in New Orleans on a first-degree murder warrant tied to the execution-style slaying of his writer pal Susan Berman in Los Angeles shortly before Christmas 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A day later, Durst's apparent confession was aired during the sixth and final episode of "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst" after he was confronted with potentially damning evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That evidence included a recently discovered letter from Durst to Berman that may match the handwriting on an anonymous note mailed Dec. 23, 2000, directing cops to Berman's body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There it is. You're caught," Durst said after walking off the set and into a bathroom when showed the letters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"What a disaster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A source close to the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office said they received the letter and other "compelling evidence from the HBO team" prior to his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In addition to bearing similar, all-capital block letters, the addresses on both envelopes misspell Beverly Hills as "Beverley Hills," documents displayed during the program show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Durst's interviews with director Andrew Jarecki and "other unreleased footage" also helped persuade an LA judge to sign the warrant, the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Durst has long been a suspect in the murder of Berman, whose father was an associate of Las Vegas mobsters Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Investigators believe Berman knew her killer, who shot her once in the back of the head after she opened the door to her Hollywood Hills home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A law enforcement source told The Los Angeles Times that investigators suspect she was killed to ensure her silence about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Berman served as Durst's spokeswoman after Kathie Durst went missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>New York authorities reinvestigating the disappearance were seeking to interview Berman at the time she was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>New evidence showed that Durst's own account of where he was the night Kathie went missing has changed multiple times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Durst bought an engagement ring for his then-girlfriend Debra Lee Charatan, after learning authorities were re-opening the probe into the disappearance - meaning she wouldn't have to testify against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Durst stood trial for a third killing, that of neighbor Morris Black, whose dismembered remains were found in 2001 in the waters off Galveston, Texas, where Durst was living in a rooming house and masquerading as a deaf-mute woman named "Dorothy Ciner."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But he was acquitted of Black's killing after claiming self-defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Durst's younger brother, Douglas, issued a statement Sunday expressing relief at the arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done," said Douglas, who is chair of the Durst Organization, one of New York's biggest real estate firms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Last year, Robert Durst was acquitted of trespassing at his brother's and nephew's homes in Hell's Kitchen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Later in December, he pleaded no contest and was fined $500 for urinating in a CVS store in Houston in July 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>If convicted of first-degree murder in Berman's slaying, Durst could wind up in a California prison with some of the nation's most notorious inmates, including mass murderer Charles Ng, "Freeway Killer" Randy Kraft and Scott Peterson, who killed his wife, Laci, and their unborn son.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Durst's arrest warrant was signed last week, and the LAPD reached out to the FBI to help track him down, sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He was traced to the JW Marriott hotel in New Orleans' French Quarter, where members of the FBI's Fugitive Task Force nabbed him in the lobby shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"He was cooperative and did not resist arrest," said LA FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A hotel source said Durst had been staying under a fake name, but that his real identity became clear when authorities showed up to arrest him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"They showed me a photograph," the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"We knew it was him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Durst had been staying in Room 2303, another hotel source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>On Sunday morning, an itemized hotel bill was wedged in that room's door, showing that a "Ward/Everette" checked in on Wednesday and paid $2,121.64 cash - with additional payments of $200 on Thursday and $400 on Friday - to stay through noon Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The bill also showed more than 30 long-distance phone calls between Wednesday and Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Many of the calls went to the New York City area, Philadelphia, western Maryland and Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Durst appeared briefly in court in New Orleans on Sunday morning and was ordered held without bail pending an extradition hearing Monday, court records show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The lawyers who represented Durst on Sunday didn't return emails seeking comment, but his Houston lawyer, Chip Lewis, said he would waive extradition to LA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"He's maintained his innocence for years. Nothing has changed," Lewis told the Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Lewis insisted Durst's arrest was orchestrated to take place before the final "Jinx" episode aired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"It's all about Hollywood now," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Jarecki declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Bad things happen to those who know Robert Durst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The eccentric heir to a New York City real estate fortune has been the chief suspect in three deaths for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Shortly after Kathie started talking divorce, she disappeared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>That was Jan. 31, 1982.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Four days later, Robert Durst called the cops to report her missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Durst later tried to distance himself from the case by denying that he had ever spoken to her after seeing her off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>State police reopened the probe in the fall of 1999 after receiving tips through another, unrelated case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Kathie Durst was declared legally dead in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Police found the 55-year-old writer dead in her California home with a single gunshot wound to the head on Dec. 24, 2000 - just before detectives were set to talk to her about the disappearance of Durst's wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>One of Berman's dogs' blood-stained paws led investigators to her body in the back of the house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>There were no signs of forced entry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Berman, who wrote books about growing up as the daughter of a mobster, had acted as Durst's unofficial spokeswoman after his wife vanished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>For years, cops could only prove that Durst was in California at the time of her murder, but they were never able to place him in Los Angeles, where Berman lived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>New evidence uncovered in "The Jinx'' changes that, sources say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Shortly after Berman's murder, Durst was linked to another killing - but this time, he admitted to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>In 2001, he was arrested for killing and dismembering elderly Texas neighbor Morris Black, whose body parts were found floating in Galveston Bay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>But local authorities weren't aware of Durst's deep pockets when he was arrested, and he was given $250,000 bail - which he posted before fleeing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Following a five-week manhunt, he was picked up in Pennsylvania - after shoplifting a sandwich - and police found $38,000 in his car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>During his trial, he admitted to shooting Black, whom he lived with at a boarding house while posing as a mute woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Durst claimed that he killed the man in self-defense and had to get rid of his body because of the publicity surrounding his wife's disappearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>He was acquitted of murder but served time for tampering with evidence and jumping bond.</td></tr>

<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hamilton issued an emphatic defence of his Formula One world championship with a flawless drive at the Albert Park Circuit in Sunday's season opener.</td></tr>
