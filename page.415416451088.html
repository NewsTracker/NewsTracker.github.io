<h3>News24.com | Obama: No excuse for criminal acts in Ferguson, Missouri</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The shooting of two police officers at a protest in Ferguson, which has been the center of a debate over race and policing, triggered a manhunt for suspects and increased tensions in the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"What had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and was worthy of protest," Obama said during an appearance on the ABC programme "Jimmy Kimmel Live."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"But there was no excuse for criminal acts, and whoever fired those shots shouldn't detract from the issue. They're criminals. They need to be arrested," he said.</td></tr>
