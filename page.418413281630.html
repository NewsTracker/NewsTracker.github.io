<h3>Thousands stranded in Indonesian as volcano closes airports</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A volcanic eruption on Indonesia's main island of Java has sparked chaos for holidaymakers as airports close and international airlines cancel flights to tourist hotspot Bali, stranding thousands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Suantika said lava and ash fall from the 10,930-feet-high mountain on Indonesia's most densely populated island has also resulted in the government calling on people to stay away from a two-mile high-danger zone around the volcano.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Evacuation of residents living near the volcano is still considered unnecessary, but authorities are urging people to wear masks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Ash can clog engines and harm other parts of the aircraft," said Transport Ministry spokesman Julius Adravida Barata.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"For the sake of passenger safety, we have to close five airports."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Airports on the islands of Bali and Lombok as well as airports at Banyuwangi and Jember in East Java have been closed since late Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>All flights are canceled until late Friday, which could be extended if the ash worsens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Barata said thousands of travelers are stranded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The volcano has proven particularly problematic for Australians, who flock to Bali during Australia's school holidays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dozens of flights between Australia and Bali's Denpasar airport by Australian carriers Jetstar and Virgin Australia have been cancelled over the past week, with the airlines citing safety concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Both carriers said they are looking into adding extra flights between Australia and Bali when conditions improve to help clear the backlog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Flights within Indonesia were already overbooked as tens of millions of the country's Muslims pour out of major cities to return to their villages during an annual mass exodus to celebrate the end of the Islamic holy month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Raung is among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The archipelago is prone to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific "Ring of Fire," a series of fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere through Japan and Southeast Asia.</td></tr>
