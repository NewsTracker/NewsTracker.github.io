<h3>Horrifying transcript gives timeline of Germanwings plane crash in Alps</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The captain of a doomed Germanwings flight yelled, "Open the damn door!" just moments before the aircraft slammed into a mountain in the French Alps, a German newspaper reported Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bild said it had read the transcript of the cockpit voice recorder, one of two "black boxes" on the plane, which revealed how Patrick Sonderheimer had desperately tried to get back into the cockpit for eight minutes after his junior colleague, Andreas Lubitz, 27, apparently locked the door and deliberately put the aircraft into descent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bild said passengers can be heard screaming in the background as Sonderheimer shouts: "For God's sake, open the door!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The captain is then heard trying to smash through the heavily reinforced door while shouting: "Open the damn door!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Moments later, the aircraft plowed into a mountain ravine between Digne-les-Bains and Barcelonnette in the southern French Alps, instantly killing all 150 people aboard - 144 passengers and six crew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The voice recorder also captured Sonderheimer earlier, the newspaper said, telling Lubitz that he was going to the bathroom and that he had not had time to do so before the flight left Barcelona, Spain, for Duesseldorf, Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Germanwings Flight 9525 was just under halfway along its route when Lubitz appeared to have deliberately set the autopilot to automatic descent, causing it to crash into the mountain Tuesday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>Germanwings and its parent company, Lufthansa, say they never received a sick note from Lubitz, suggesting he hid his illness from the airline.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>"The copilot, the family, belong to our community, and we stand by this, and we embrace them and will not hide this, and want to support the family in particular," the Rev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Michael Dietrich said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Investigators in Germany are trying to piece together a profile of Lubitz to establish what motive he had for downing the aircraft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>His ex-girlfriend, named only as Maria W., 26, a flight attendant, told Bild that Lubitz had said to her: "One day I'm going to do something that will change the whole system, and everyone will know my name and remember it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I never knew what he meant by that, but now it makes sense," Bild quoted the young woman as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She added that at night Lubitz was troubled by nightmares and would wake up screaming, "We're going down!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The flight is to take off 20 minutes late, and Sonderheimer apologizes for the delay and says the crew will try to make up the time in the air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Before takeoff, the captain tells Lubitz that he didn't have time to go to the bathroom before leaving Barcelona.</td></tr>
