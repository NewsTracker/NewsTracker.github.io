<h3>Baltimore Mayor Demands Answers in Death of Freddie Gray</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE - The mayor of Baltimore said Friday that several questions still needed to be answered concerning the death of Freddie Gray, the unarmed black man who died Sunday, a week after suffering a spinal cord injury while being arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Our community has been very clear - they demand answers, and so do I," Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I still want to know what policies or procedures were not followed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>More specifically, Ms. Rawlings-Blake said she wanted to know why police officers apparently did not follow the policy requiring that all prisoners wear seatbelts while being transported, and why they did not call for medical assistance after Mr. Gray asked for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Baltimore police acknowledged on Thursday that Mr. Gray was not wearing a seatbelt while in the back of the van that took him to the police station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And the police commissioner, Anthony W. Batts, has said that officers were slow to recognize that Mr. Gray, who apparently had asthma, needed medical attention; Mr. Gray asked for his inhaler before he was put in the van, but he did not have it with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At the same time, Ms. Rawlings-Blake and other leaders urged the community to have patience and to allow the investigation to be completed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"In order to have justice and not just seek justice, the investigation needs to follow procedures," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We have to be able to follow up on leads, and they have to be as thorough as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The one thing we all know is that because of this incident," Ms. Rawlings-Blake said, "a mother has to bury her child, and she doesn't even know exactly how or why this tragedy occurred, only that this occurred while he was in police custody. I know that this is unacceptable, and I want answers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>With a rally protesting police practices in Baltimore scheduled for Saturday afternoon outside City Hall, the mayor met Friday with a cross section of faith and community leaders who urged demonstrators to rally peacefully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We know that people are coming in from outside of Baltimore," Ms. Rawlings-Blake said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If you're going to come here, come here to help us, not to hurt us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The president of the Baltimore branch of the N.A.A.C.P., Tessa Hill-Aston, cautioned outsiders further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We do not need people coming in bullying our community," Ms. Hill-Aston said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Rallying and marching is what we do, but we do it peacefully," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"And when we finish, the neighborhood is still whole."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Malik Zulu Shabazz, who is the president of Black Lawyers for Justice and is helping to organize Saturday's march, said that although he expected the march to be peaceful, he could not be certain that it would be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We cannot guarantee that there'll be no arrests, because many other groups will be coming in and may exercise civil disobedience," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"While I am troubled by the mayor's inability to pursue justice against the officers, I appreciate her general stance of supporting protesters' First Amendment rights," Mr. Shabazz said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr. Gray's funeral is scheduled for Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A wake will be held Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Stephen Babcock reported from Baltimore, and John Corrales from New York.</td></tr>
