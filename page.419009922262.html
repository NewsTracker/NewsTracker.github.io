<h3>Bombs Explode Outside Two Churches In Las Cruces, New Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Aug 2 (Reuters) - Bombs went off outside two churches in the southern New Mexico City of Las Cruces on Sunday, disrupting services and sending federal agents and local police to investigate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>No one was hurt and there was minimal property damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The first explosion blew up a mailbox near an administrative entrance to the Calvary Baptist Church as several worshipers gathered inside for Sunday morning prayers, and a second blast went off 20 minutes later in a trash can near the main entrance to Holy Cross Catholic Church, where services had just started, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The glass entryway to the second church was shattered, but there was little other damage to either church, and no injuries were reported, said Dan Trujillo, a spokesman for the Las Cruces Police Department.</td></tr>
