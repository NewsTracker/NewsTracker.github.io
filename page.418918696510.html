<h3>'Mission: Impossible' star Rebecca Ferguson: ready, set, action</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Rebecca Ferguson plays Ilsa, who may or may not be on Ethan Hunt's side in "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tom Cruise fans know that he does his own stunts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But his "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation" co-star Rebecca Ferguson is no slouch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Though the 31-year-old Swede is best known for period pieces such as BBC's 2013 historical drama "The White Queen," Ferguson holds her own - and then some - in the fifth flick in the high-octane franchise, out Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A: Very much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>My God, it's so warm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>I'm coming from Scandi-Land so I'm feeling it more, I think.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I'd love to stay longer and speak to locals about their favorite coffee places and beaches and stuff like that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>I actually don't have thoughts on America as I haven't been traveling around much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>When I do come here, it's quick in and out for meetings and press tours and such.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But being stuck in a hotel talking about this movie is great as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A: I've loved "Mission: Impossible" since the beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I've seen both the television shows and movies I don't know how many times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It never occurred to me that I'd actually be in one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>After "The White Queen," I told my agent, "This is all great, but I'd like to do more action."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I never thought it would happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>We sent a tape over to Tom Cruise and (writer-director) Christopher McQuarrie, and lo and behold, they asked to meet with me in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It was about chemistry, but they needed to know how I would respond to direction and if I could be trained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A couple of weeks later I got the part of undercover bad-ass agent Ilsa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Yeah, kind of a fairytale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A: Quite a lot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Six hours a day, six days a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But it's not like hitting the gym for hours on end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>You wake up and do Pilates for two hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Then you do two hours of sprinting and regular training, stretching, choreography.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A lot of different things to change your body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>I had to master what I call the "killer thigh move."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>I'd be exhausted - just shattered - at the end of a day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A: Nothing special.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>If a scene called for sprinting, I would eat carbs, anything to give me energy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>When I had to slip into a tight, slender dress, we'd hold back on the pasta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>For underwater scenes, to hold your breath longer and last, you had to kind of watch your food intake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>I'd been diving and I love water, but holding your breath is hard work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>You're moving around a lot, exerting yourself and maneuvering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>It's extreme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Q: Did you get hurt at all?</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>A: I don't even have one good story of me getting hurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Everything was just so organized and well-prepared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>You're not supposed to hurt yourself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Though I bruise like a peach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The more bruises I had the more I felt like I accomplished something.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Q: Are you anything like Ilsa?</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>A: It's a hard one comparing yourself to the character.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>She's an undercover agent; I'm not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>She kills people; I don't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>She's mysterious and highly intelligent, and I don't know if I'd call myself that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>She's cool, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>I like her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Q: What's it like acting alongside Tom Cruise?</td></tr>
