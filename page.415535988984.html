<h3>Sydney Rooster facing drug ban: report</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The NRL released a statement late on Wednesday afternoon stating that Kennedy was issued "with a Notice of Alleged Anti-Doping Rule Violations under the NRL's Leagues Anti-Doping Policy".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The ASADA investigation is understood to have been into Kennedy's activities during his first stint at the Roosters in 2013, and followed a similar line of enquiries to those centred on former NRL winger Sandor Earl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kennedy left the tricolours for Brisbane last year before returning to the Roosters ahead of this NRL season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The notice alleges that Mr Kennedy breached the policy through the possession and attempted use of banned substances," the NRL statement read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The NRL will not be making further comment until Mr Kennedy has had the opportunity to respond to the NRL."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kennedy's notice relates to the alleged use of performance enhancing drugs, which earns a two-year ban under the WADA code.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kennedy returned to the Roosters, where the 26-year-old made his NRL debut in 2009, after an unhappy one-year stint with the Broncos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Broncos boss Paul White said the club's decision to release Kennedy was football related.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It had nothing to do with the story that appeared in the paper today," White said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We've obviously restructured our entire roster and Martin was one of those players that moved onto another club as part of that restructure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We've never had any contact with any agencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Martin's no longer at our club so we've got no cause to make any further comment on it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Kennedy didn't play for the Roosters in their opening two NRL matches this season but was included by coach Trent Robinson on an extended six-man bench for games against North Queensland and South Sydney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The Sydney Roosters have been advised by the NRL that Martin Kennedy has been issued a Notice of Alleged Anti-Doping Rule Violations under the NRL's Leagues Anti-Doping Policy," the statement read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The club has only today been made aware of the allegations against Kennedy and wishes to reinforce that the club maintains the absolute highest standards in its own policies and governance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The Roosters will not be making any further comment until Kennedy has had the opportunity to respond to the NRL."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Kennedy has 24 hours to make an initial reply to the infraction notice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Earl is still fighting a potential four-year ban for alleged trafficking of banned substances, while 11 past and present Cronulla players were handed back-dated 12-month bans in August.</td></tr>

<h3>Expert says girl's running death not a homicide</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - A defense expert said in dramatic testimony Tuesday that he wouldn't classify the death of a young girl as a homicide even though her grandmother is accused of running her to death, yet he agreed the child wouldn't have died without exhausting physical exertion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Questioned by an attorney for Joyce Hardin Garrard at her capital murder trial, forensic pathologist Dr. James Lauridson indicated he couldn't say someone else caused the death of Savannah Hardin, 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Knowing what I know I would not have called this a homicide, I would have called it indeterminate," said Lauridson, retired chief medical examiner for Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lauridson also disagreed with autopsy findings that concluded the girl suffered from heat exhaustion and dehydration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Lauridson - using water, dye and a plastic skull to demonstrate sodium deficiency - said the girl was actually over-hydrated and had no signs of heat illness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Jurors paid close attention to Lauridson, standing and craning their necks to follow his testimony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Garrard began crying after he said her granddaughter's death wasn't a homicide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But under cross-examination by prosecutor Marcus Reid, Lauridson admitted he didn't have all the witness statements and police files that were available to Dr. Emily Ward, the state pathologist who ruled that the girl's death was a homicide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Her decision was crucial to the decision to charge Garrard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Neighbors have testified they saw the 49-year-old Boaz woman forcing the girl to keep running even after she was vomiting and begging to stop, and Reid drove home the point to jurors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It was running that killed her. Isn't that right?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Reid asked Lauridson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Yes," Lauridson replied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Lauridson's testimony built upon that of former forensic investigator Chris Crow, who helped Ward with the post-mortem investigation of Savannah's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Crow testified that a report indicated Ward didn't have the girl's medical records before conducting the autopsy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The final autopsy report wasn't completed until weeks after Garrard already had been indicted, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Crow said the autopsy took Ward only an hour, which he described as "pretty quick" for such an examination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But Crow testified under cross-examination that Ward was more experienced than other pathologists in her office, possibly accounting for her speed, and Ward was in a meeting where authorities detailed their evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Garrard, who is accused of making the girl run for hours as punishment for a lie about candy on Feb. 17, 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Garrard, of Boaz, says she is innocent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Before testimony about the autopsy, jurors received differing pictures of the relationship between Garrard and her granddaughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Longtime elementary school principal Donna Joy Bone Johnson testified that she didn't see any cause for concern in the relationship between Garrard and the girl, who attended her school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Johnson portrayed Garrard as the primary caregiver for the girl, the daughter of Garrard's son Robert Hardin, who was overseas at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Savannah was "a competitor" who wanted to do well in school and athletics, Johnson said, and Garrard often came to school to talk with her about Savannah's behavior or seek advice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I've been doing this a long time. There were no red flags," said Johnson, the sister of Garrard's lead attorney, Dani Bone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Earlier, the child's pediatrician testified that she worried about the relationship between Garrard, the child, and stepmother Jessica Mae Hardin, who also is charged in the girl's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Dr. Deborah Smith said the relationship among the three "was not a normal dynamic" and that she had considered contacting authorities but didn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Smith didn't explain exactly what she considered to be odd, and a prosecutor didn't press her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Garrard is charged with capital murder while Hardin faces the lesser charge of murder for allegedly failing to intervene and help the child.</td></tr>
