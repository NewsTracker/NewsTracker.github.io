<h3>Survey shows unexpected upturn in German business confidence as Greece worries subside</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN - Business confidence in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has risen unexpectedly this month as worries over Greece have subsided, a closely watched survey showed Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Ifo think tank's monthly confidence index increased to 108 points for July from 107.5 in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Economists had expected a slight decline to 107.2, which would have been a third consecutive drop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ifo said that managers' assessment of their current situation and their outlook for the next six months both improved, defying expectations that they would slip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The institute's president, Hans-Werner Sinn, said in a statement that "the recent easing of the Greece situation contributed to stronger sentiment in the German economy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A preliminary agreement earlier this month on a new bailout for debt-laden Greece dampened fears of a potentially disruptive Greek exit from the 19-nation euro currency, though a full deal still has to be hammered out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The German economy has been helped lately by low unemployment and increasing domestic demand, and has been growing even as other European countries struggle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is still being bolstered by a weak euro exchange rate and low energy prices, said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING-DiBa in Frankfurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Even if the dose has been reduced somewhat, the German economy is still on steroids," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Risks looking ahead include longer-than-expected periods of weakness of the U.S. and the Chinese economies, both of which are major German export destinations, and a possible new flaring of the Greek crisis, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ifo polls around 7,000 managers each month on their assessment of the economy.</td></tr>
