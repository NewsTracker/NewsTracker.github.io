<h3>Nine British medical students cross into Syria to help Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Up to nine British medical students, five men and four women, who had been studying in Sudan, are understood to have flown to Istanbul 10 days ago and slipped into Syria overland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>British Foreign Office officials are providing consular support to several of the families who have congregated close to the border, desperately trying to urge their children home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Although the students do not appear to have volunteered to fight, the families nevertheless fear they have been "brainwashed" into helping the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The parents have been in regular contact with their children by mobile phone and are pledging to stay there until they can successfully bring them home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The alarm was raised after one of the women, named in Turkey as 19-year-old Lena Maumoon Abdulqadir, sent a social networking message to her sister in Britain on March 12, telling her: "Don't worry, we've reached Turkey and are on our way to volunteer helping wounded Syrian people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Her father, Maumoon, informed the British police before setting off himself for Turkey, and alerting the police there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He also made contact with Mehmet Ali Ediboglu, a Turkish opposition politician, who has helped co-ordinate the efforts of the families, who are understood to be from the British Sudanese community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Ediboglu said the nine had travelled with two other Sudanese students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It is understood that British Foreign Office officials are supporting seven families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Meanwhile, the University of Medical Sciences and Technology in Khartoum confirmed that five of its students with British passports had gone missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A spokeswoman for the British Foreign Office said: "We are providing consular assistance to families of British nationals who are believed to be missing after travelling to Turkey We are working closely with the Turkish police to establish their whereabouts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A British government spokesman said the students would not necessarily face charges if they returned to Britain, provided they could prove they had not been fighting.</td></tr>
