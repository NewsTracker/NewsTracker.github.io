<h3>New York real estate baron Durst arrested on LA murder warrant</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Durst, born in 1943, is known for life twists that led him to be questioned but not charged in the mysterious deaths of his first wife Kathleen Durst in 1982 and a longtime friend in 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>There was no lawyer listed for Durst on the arrest report and Durst has maintained his innocence in the deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The New York Times reported last week that the district attorney in Los Angeles had recently reopened an investigation into the December 2000 killing of Durst's friend Susan Berman, and was tying it to the case of Kathleen Durst, who went missing from New York and was eventually pronounced legally dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The investigation could be bolstered by new evidence shown for the first time in a six-part HBO documentary series about Durst called "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst," the New York Times said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a telephone interview with the newspaper, Durst said he did not have the "faintest idea" who killed Berman, nor did he know what happened to his first wife, it reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a separate case, after being arrested while living in Texas disguised as a mute woman, Durst was acquitted of murder in 2001 after convincing a jury that he had fatally shot and dismembered an elderly neighbor in an act of self-defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Durst Organization oversees the lease and maintenance of One World Trade Center, the western hemisphere's tallest skyscraper, built on the site of the twin towers destroyed in al Qaeda's hijacked airliner attack on Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>11, 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His life also inspired the 2010 Hollywood movie "All Good Things."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In December 2014, Durst appeared in a New York courtroom on charges of trespassing on property owned by his estranged family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Durst Organization is responsible for a good portion of the city's skyline - the company says it owns 11 Manhattan office towers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Robert Durst, who has lived in Texas after getting about $65 million from the settlement of a lawsuit he brought against family trusts, was charged in 2014 with urinating on a drugstore candy rack in Houston.</td></tr>

<h3>UK Arrests 3 Teens Stopped in Turkey on Way to Syria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The three suspects were being questioned at a central London police station after their alleged bid to get to Syria, coming soon after three British schoolgirls managed to elude authorities and get to Syria last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The girls are believed by police to have joined Islamic State militants in their self-declared caliphate in parts of Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>British police said the three males, two 17-year-old boys and a 19-year-old man, have been arrested on suspicion of planning terrorist acts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They haven't been charged and their names haven't been released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When the schoolgirls managed to slip into Syria despite a search by both Turkish and British authorities, there was finger-pointing on both sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Things were quite different Sunday, as Turkey and Britain hailed the fruits of their cooperation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The male trio left Britain several days ago, traveling to Spain and then flying from Barcelona to Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They were detained in Istanbul Friday after British officials notified Turkish authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>British legislator Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the case shows that the number of young Britons trying to reach the conflict zone in Syria "is on a much larger scale" than had been thought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Vaz praised Turkish authorities for acting quickly to prevent the teens from entering Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Police counterterrorism officials and security services personnel have said their resources have been badly stretched as they try to maintain surveillance on the growing number of individuals interested in joining the extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They have warned that some who return after spending time in the conflict zone plan to launch attacks inside Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A senior Turkish government official, who can't be named because of Turkish rules that bar civil servants from speaking to journalists without prior authorization, said the two 17-year-old boys had been detained at Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen airport Friday by Turkish authorities who were acting on intelligence provided by British officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The teenagers were planning to travel to Syria, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Turkish authorities believe they wanted to join IS extremists, but the official cautioned that they weren't "100 percent" certain that was their aim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The 19-year-old man was detained at the airport after questioning by police based on profiling at the airport, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>British police originally believed only two teens were traveling, but soon learned that a third was involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They were deported to London on Saturday - instead of Spain as is the normal procedure in Turkey - because Britain insisted that they be returned to Britain, the Turkish official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Turkish official described the incident as a "'joint Turkish-British operation," and said Turkey welcomed the timely intelligence provided by Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Turkey is doing all that it can to stop the passage into Syria, but there has to be cooperation," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This operation shows what can be achieved when there is cooperation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Turkey's strategic position as a convenient link between Western Europe and Syria has meant that an increasing number of Britons have traveled there to use it as a jumping off point to enter Syria and link up with IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>British police say roughly 700 Britons have traveled to Syria to join extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Recent cases indicate a growing number of young women are traveling there to become "jihadi brides."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Authorities say Internet-based social media have made it much easier for young Britons to communicate with extremists inside Syria and that many are also drawn by websites touting the attraction of living under Islamic law.</td></tr>
