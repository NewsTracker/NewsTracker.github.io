<h3>CANNES WATCH: 'Arabian Nights' canine named Cannes' top dog</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - A small white dog named Lucky has taken the award for Cannes' best performance on four legs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The maltipoo - a cross between a Maltese terrier and a poodle - was awarded the Palme Dog at the film festival on Friday for a sparky performance as Dixie the dog in Miguel Gomes' "Arabian Nights."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Portuguese director's three-part film is a six-hour story set in present-day Portugal but inspired by Middle Eastern classic "The 1,001 Nights."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Runner-up for the Palme Dog was Bob, the canine companion - and brother - of Colin Farrell's character in Yorgos Lanthimos' "The Lobster," a surreal story in which people who can't find mates are turned into animals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An unofficial part of the Cannes Film Festival, the Palm Dog was founded in 2001 and is judged by a panel of film critics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Its name is a play on Cannes' top film prize, the Palme d'Or.</td></tr>
