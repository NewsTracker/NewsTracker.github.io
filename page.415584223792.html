<h3>Clinton: US politics could use 'camps for adults'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clinton offered a bipartisan, feel-good message Thursday during a paid speech to camp counselors in the weeks before her expected presidential campaign launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She was presented with a gray sweatshirt emblazoned with "Camp David" - the presidential retreat in Maryland - but otherwise steered clear of her prospective campaign, pointing to a "huge fun deficit" in the nation and the need for politicians of all stripes to reach across the aisle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We really need camps for adults," Clinton said at the American Camp Association, New York and New Jersey's Tri State CAMP Conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Maybe mix it up a little bit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Playing on the colors of U.S. politics, she imagined a red cabin and a blue cabin where people "have to come together and actually listen to each other. Wouldn't that be a novel idea?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton answered friendly questions on stage in a session moderated by Jay Jacobs, a New York summer camp executive who supported Clinton's New York Senate bid and serves as chairman of the Nassau County, N.Y., Democratic Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The former secretary of state did not address recent criticism of her use of a personal email account at the State Department and was not asked about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Preparing for a campaign, Clinton has often spoken of the need for congressional leaders to work together even while she criticizes some of their actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She has taken to Twitter in recent days to register disapproval with a GOP budget proposal, efforts by Republicans to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law and the stalled nomination of Loretta Lynch for attorney general.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said Clinton's "lip service to bipartisanship" masked a partisan record in the Senate and support for Obama's "divisive, left-wing agenda."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was probably Clinton's final paid speech before the start of her presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She has two public events on her schedule next week but nothing scheduled in April, when she is expected to announce her bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Since departing the State Department in early 2013, Clinton has appeared at a number of corporate events, universities and conventions, often receiving fees of $200,000 or more, potentially opening her up to attacks of being beholden to corporate interests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>During her appearance, Clinton offered plenty of camp stories, recalling daughter Chelsea Clinton's insistence at attending a sleep-away camp as a child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>When she and former President Bill Clinton let Chelsea go to a language camp to study German for a week, it was tough as a parent, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It was the worst week - well, I've had a few bad weeks," Clinton said to laughter in a nod to the scrutiny she's faced in public life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"But it was up there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Asked about her resilience, she talked about her mother's difficult upbringing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Whenever I get a little bit, you know, feeling kind of sorry for myself, thinking 'That's not fair, that's not right,' I say to myself, 'Yeah, right and look at what my mother went through,'" Clinton said.</td></tr>

<h3>Egyptian Singer, Meet Burundi Bassist. Play Among Yourselves!</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Play Among Yourselves!</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Late one night, Dina el-Wadi, a singer and musician from Cairo, arrived in Kampala, Uganda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She'd come for a gathering of musicians who live in countries along the Nile River.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was Selamnesh Zemene from Ethiopia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Dina was fascinated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The two singers began comparing traditional musical modes and vocal techniques, and right away created a song together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They called the song "In Wonderland."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That's a great title, because the Nile Project creates its own wonderland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We started about 3 1/2 years ago to bring musicians from the 11 Nile basin countries to collaborate on music that merges many of their traditions and styles and instruments," says Egyptian ethnomusicologist Mina Girgis, co-founder and president of the Nile Project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"So we have musicians from Uganda, Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and from Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. And we are using this music to inspire a larger conversation about water and about all the challenges we face in the Nile basin."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If not for this initiative, the musicians would likely never meet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I didn't have any chance in Egypt to collaborate with African musicians," says Dina el-Wadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Usually we participate with European and American musicians. So for me, it was the first time to get in touch with the real scene now in East Africa. I start to love so much the African identity, because usually we are near to the Arab culture more than the African culture in Egypt. So as I love the Oriental stuff, I really love the African stuff now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Steven Sogo, a bass player from Burundi, agrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"In Africa, we don't listen to each other," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"In my country, you will listen easily to American music, to some African music like Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and South Africa. That's it. So when I met these guys, and for the first time I heard Egyptian music I said, 'Wow.' And then after a year, I practiced this music, but I didn't feel good, because even though you've learned this, you have to feel it. Now actually I can say that I'm very lucky, I can feel it and I can enjoy this music and understand. So the Nile project for me has been like a school."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Performing in the Nile Project is a challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"No one leader here," says Dina el-Wadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We create together. So to be chorus sometimes, to be lead singer sometimes, to be a musician on one track [and] to be just listener. There was a lot of challenge. Artists have to negotiate different languages, different musical systems, singing lead on one song and being in the chorus on the next."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>When they all come on stage together - 13 of the musicians are currently touring the U.S. - you'd never know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Picture a stage full of musicians and singers surrounded by instruments both familiar and strange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In the center, a robed African woman plays a large, deep-toned lyre called inanga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Egyptian ethnomusicologist Mina Girgis is co-founder and president of the Nile Project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He says the inanga is a kind of invitation to a musical journey along the Nile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We start the show with Sophie Nzayisenga from Rwanda playing the inanga," says Mina Girgis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>(That's a deep-toned lyre.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"And every musician comes on stage to join her. No one leaves the stage during the entire show. It's one band. So we have individuals playing many instruments. There are many dialogues that happen on stage. The songs kind of weave traditions. And some would sound Egyptian. Some would sound Ethiopian, but many are sounding like a collaborations among these different styles."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The hope is that the collaboration will not only to greater understanding but to better stewardship of the river itself.</td></tr>
