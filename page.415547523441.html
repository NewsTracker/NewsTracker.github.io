<h3>U.S. seeks negotiated settlement in Syria that excludes Assad: envoy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Syria's President Bashar al-Assad (R) meets Iranian Minister of Economy and Finance Ali Tayebnia in Damascus March 16, 2015, in this picture released by Syria's national news agency SANA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The United States still wants a negotiated political settlement in Syria that excludes President Bashar al-Assad, and its position on the Syrian leader has not changed, top U.S. envoy John Allen told Turkish officials late on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday the U.S. would have to negotiate with Assad, though the State Department later said he was not specifically referring to the Syrian leader and that Washington would never bargain with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kerry's comments drew condemnation in Turkey, one of Assad's most strident opponents, with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu saying negotiating with the Syrian leader would be like shaking hands with Adolf Hitler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"General Allen reiterated that the United States' position on Assad has not changed," the U.S. embassy in Ankara said in a statement after Allen, the special envoy responsible for building the anti-Islamic State coalition, held talks in Ankara.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The United States believes that he has lost all legitimacy to govern, that conditions in Syria under his rule have led to the rise of ISIL (Islamic State) and other terrorist groups, and that we continue to seek a negotiated outcome to the Syrian conflict that does not in the end include Assad."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Allen held "constructive talks" with Turkish foreign ministry undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioglu late on Tuesday and welcomed Turkey's support in the training of vetted members of Syria's opposition, the statement said.</td></tr>

<h3>Ukraine rebels warn they could abandon cease-fire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Alexander Zakharchenko and Igor Plotnitsky said in a statement that legislation giving areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions special status has been weakened by the amendments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We agreed to a special status for the Donbass within a renewed Ukraine, although our people wanted total independence. We agreed to this to avoid the spilling of fraternal blood," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Ukraine did not renew itself," it continued. Rebels have pushed for revisions to the constitution to decentralize power, but argue that authority is still held by powerful businessmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A law on granting autonomy to eastern territories was approved by parliament Tuesday, but with a number of changes that have drawn sharp criticism from Moscow-backed rebels and Russia alike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Foremost among the rebels' objections is a requirement for elections " to be held under Ukrainian laws " to take place before the special status can come into effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman said in an emailed statement that enacting the special status law without elections approved by Kiev would result in the legitimization of what Ukraine considers unlawful rebel governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Ukraine's parliament had undertaken a wholesale rewriting of the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"What comes out of parliament's decree is that only when these territories are led by somebody suitable for Kiev will the law on special status come into effect," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"That is an attempt to turn everything that was agreed upon on its head."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ukraine has also drawn anger from separatists with its plans to seek deployment of United Nations and European Union peacekeeping missions in the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Parliament voted Tuesday to back a formal request for the mission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Zakharchenko and Plotnitsky said placement of a peacekeeping contingent had not been agreed at cease-fire negotiations concluded between the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France last month in the Belarusian capital, Minsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The manipulation of good intentions for coverage is another attempt to get out of the Minsk agreement," the rebel leaders' statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A U.N. peacekeeping mission would likely need backing from all five permanent members of the Security Council, and Russia is almost certain to resist the move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>More than 6,000 people have been killed since fighting broke out last April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Clashes have reduced substantially since a cease-fire was declared last month.</td></tr>
