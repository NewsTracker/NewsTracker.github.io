<h3>Guinea shuts border with Sierra Leone in effort to end Ebola</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa has killed more than 10,300 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Liberia currently has no Ebola patients, and Sierra Leone has seen a fairly steady decline in cases in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the disease remains stubbornly entrenched in Guinea more than a year after the outbreak started and authorities are now ramping up efforts to eliminate the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Guinean President Alpha Conde announced this weekend that emergency measures would be "reinforced" for a 45-day period in five districts, including some along the border with Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The decision to close the border was made in the context of those new measures, according to Cmdr.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mamadou Alpha Barry, spokesman for the national gendarmerie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Previously, Guinean authorities had monitored people crossing into the country for symptoms of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Sierra Leone, however, was keeping its side of the border open, according to government spokesman Theo Nicol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He confirmed that the Guinean side was closed, although he said Sierra Leone had not been formally informed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The sudden border closure caught many people off guard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Djalima Balde, a Guinean who had been visiting Freetown, the Sierra Leonean capital, was stuck at a border crossing on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Guinea sent security forces to the border on Friday night in response to reports that Sierra Leoneans were streaming over to avoid a three-day, nationwide shutdown over the weekend to help end Ebola.</td></tr>
