<h3>Developments on Baltimore man fatally injured in custody</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A 25-year-old Baltimore man died a week after his spine was mysteriously injured while he was in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A look at the developments Wednesday in the case of Freddie Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>LYNCH MOB?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A statement released by the Baltimore police union comparing protesters of Gray's death to a "lynch mob" drew criticism on Twitter by users who called it racially insensitive and inappropriate, given that the demonstrations have been peaceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A little later, at a news conference, union President Gene Ryan backpedaled, saying, "Maybe I should reword that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I don't want it to turn into a lynch mob," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I'm afraid of the crowd becoming hostile," said a tense-sounding Ryan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"They have been very peaceful to this point. My main concern is for the public and the police officers that they remain peaceful and exercise their constitutional right to do what they're doing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ryan said he feared violence because of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York that followed police-involved deaths of unarmed suspects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>At an evening protest later in the day, more than 100 demonstrators pushed on a police barricade at the Western District precinct, and about 30 police officers pushed back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some protesters hurled obscenities and threw soda cans and bottles at the line of police behind the barricades, but none hit the officers and the demonstration remained largely peaceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>For the most part, police have ignored the insults and not reacted to provocations from the protesters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At least three people were detained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>No one has been injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>While a group of protesters remained outside the police station, a second group led by a man with a bullhorn marched in the streets, stopping at various intersections for die-ins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The group would block an intersection briefly before moving on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They passed near the hospital where Gray died, and continued on to the Inner Harbor, where they briefly blocked a key downtown intersection before continuing on and stopping in front of City Hall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Bernadette Washington said she has been marching every day since Gray's death and she's frustrated that police don't seem to be embracing the message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"They think it's a joke. For real. They just stand there," Washington said, gesturing at officers deployed outside the district station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Washington said she grew up with Gray and called him a good person who didn't need to die.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She didn't understand why the six officers involved in Gray's arrest are still drawing a paycheck while they're suspended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"All we want is justice," Washington said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Five of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest gave statements that day, a week before his death, police said Wednesday while declining to reveal the content of what they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>An attorney who works with the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police had mentioned the statements earlier in the day as a way of showing that the officers involved have been cooperative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Police said the department's internal investigation into Gray's arrest will be turned over to the Baltimore State's Attorney's Office for review on May 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The prosecutor's office can determine whether to file charges against the officers involved or present the case to a grand jury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The U.S. Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she welcomed the Justice Department's involvement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>She has called along for an outside review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Whenever a police force conducts an internal investigation, there are always appropriate questions of transparency and impartiality," she said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"My goal has always been to get answers to the questions so many of us are still asking with regards to Mr. Gray's death."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Gray's family has an attorney who is working on his own investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said he has spoken with city and state officials about the situation and won't be ordering any further investigations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He said he believes the current investigations are being handled properly and that "the last thing we need is people stepping all over each other."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"We don't want to make politics out of this tragic situation," Hogan told reporters after an Earth Day event in Annapolis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>He said his heart goes out to Gray's family "and everyone involved in the entire incident."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Belinda Barksdale.</td></tr>

<tr><td>39</td><td>Marchelle Lowery is holding up the poster near the site of Gray's arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>More than a thousand demonstrators gathered at the site of the arrest Tuesday to remember Gray.</td></tr>
