<h3>Russell Brand cancels SXSW appearance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Russell Brand cancels SXSW appearance Russell Brand has pulled out of appearing in person at the South by Southwest Film Festival, the comedian announced on his website Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I apologise sincerely to the organisers of sxsw for my non-attendance," he wrote on RussellBrand.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Brand was scheduled to attend the world premiere of documentary BRAND: A Second Coming, which is the festival's opening-night film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I know Ondi [Timoner, the film's director] is an artist and I'm told the film is good, but for me watching it was very uncomfortable," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The film zeros in on the issue of fame, with Brand as the centerpiece, following him as he grapples with transitioning "from a relatively conventional celebrity to whatever the hell it is I am now," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"You'd think a narcissist would like nothing more than talking about themselves and their rags-to-riches, hard-luck story, but actually, it felt like, to me, my life was hard enough the first time round, and going through it again was painful and sad," he continued on his site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The film took seven years and "as many directors" to complete, according to the comedian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Over the sprawling time period in which we'd been in production I'd transitioned from an attention-seeking missile, exploding into exhibitionism at every turn, into a man who, whilst still a show-off, was becoming disillusioned and disconnected from fame, celebrity and all its sticky ephemera," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>BRAND: A Second Coming premieres in Austin at SXSW Friday, March 13.</td></tr>

<h3>Mich. man who fatally punched soccer referee sentenced</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Michigan man who fatally punched a soccer referee before he could be rejected from an adult-league game was sentenced Friday after the referee's widow boldly addressed her husband's killer and served him a penalty card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The powerful gesture made by John Bieniewicz's widow was captured on camera but cowardly missed by his convicted killer, Bassel Abdul-Amir Saad, 36, who instead stood with his back to her and wept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kris Bieniewicz, who was left to raise two young boys on her own, meanwhile ripped his lenient sentencing for what she said should have been a murder conviction for the savage June attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Mr. Saad murdered my husband, senselessly," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I have a 9-year-old son who says to me, 'but Mom I thought if you killed somebody that you go to prison for the rest of your life?' How do I explain that to him? How do I explain that the system didn't do his father the justice that he deserved? I can't. I can't explain it," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In her closing statement she held up a crimson plastic card, like the ones used by referees to eject players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I would like to serve Mr. Saad with the red card that he was entitled to," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Saad, speaking amid tears, offered an apology to his victim as well as his family and said he thinks about them and prays for them every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I hope one day that they will forgive me. I didn't mean that, I'm so sorry from the bottom of my heart. I didn't know that that was going to happen," he said, all the while keeping his back to his victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The punch to Bieniewicz's head knocked the father of two out cold and left him in critical condition before he died in a hospital two days later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Saad fled the scene but turned himself in to police the next day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Judge Thomas Cameron, speaking after Saad's tearful apology, ridiculed his behavior as "childish."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"You stand before the court as a man convicted of a childish, senseless act of taking another man's life with no excuse or justification other than dealing with rage that you were unable to contain," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In addition to ordering the eight to 15 years behind bars, Cameron ordered Saad to pay a restitution of $9,265.55.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Since Bieniewicz's tragic death a GoFundMe account has been set up to raise money for his surviving family.</td></tr>
