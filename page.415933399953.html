<h3>Robert Durst's re-emergence puts spotlight on Fox News' Jeanine Pirro, a former prosecutor</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>She has spent 15 years on Durst's trail, making him wary of her and giving her a unique perch from which to comment on Durst's latest arrest for the Fox News Channel, where she's the host of "Justice with Judge Jeanine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The re-emergence of Durst in HBO's "The Jinx" and his recent arrest in a California murder case has once again brightened the spotlight on the tough-talking Pirro after a career that made plenty of headlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That has included a painful U.S. Senate run against Hillary Rodham Clinton, a spot on People magazine's "most beautiful people" list and winning re-election as district attorney while her husband served a prison term for tax fraud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Last weekend, she was portrayed in a "Saturday Night Live" skit as telling Durst, "I'm always right behind you, Robert, and I'm gonna catch you with my own two gorgeously manicured hands."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She doesn't pretend to be objective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In an interview with The Associated Press, she said, "Every ounce of my prosecutorial being says this guy is an evil person."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She insists he was responsible for the death of his first wife, though he's never been charged; should not have been acquitted in the killing and dismemberment of a Texas neighbor; and was behind the killing of his friend in California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In 2000, Pirro, then the district attorney in Westchester County, New York, reopened the cold case of the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Durst was never charged, but Pirro refused to rule him out as a suspect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The case has since been declared a homicide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Pirro told The AP she was driven to solve the killing partly because of a connection she felt with Kathie Durst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"She was in med school not long after I was in law school," Pirro said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"There really weren't a lot of women in professional schools in those days. We were both trying to make it in a man's world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>As part of the reopened investigation, Pirro said, she planned to question Susan Berman, who was Durst's confidante and spokeswoman at the time of Kathie Durst's disappearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Christmas Eve 2000, Berman was shot to death in her home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The first person I thought of was Robert Durst," Pirro said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Durst was charged last month with Berman's murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In 2003, when Durst went on trial for another killing - his admitted shooting and dismemberment of a neighbor, Morris Black - Pirro made several appearances in the courtroom in Galveston, Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Durst claimed self-defense, arguing he cut up the body in a panic and fled because he knew Pirro was looking into his wife's death and no one would believe him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>That was also why he sometimes posed as a woman, his lawyer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The judge included Pirro in a gag order, and Durst's lawyer said in closing arguments, "If Ms. Pirro kept her mouth shut, none of this would have happened."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Durst's acquittal astonished Pirro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I believe that jury in Galveston got that just plain wrong," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Pirro, a popular Republican in an increasingly Democratic county, won three terms as district attorney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But her political career was probably stunted by her husband, attorney Albert Pirro, who acknowledged he fathered a child with another woman and was convicted in 2000 of tax evasion and conspiracy after an embarrassing trial that laid out the couple's lavish lifestyle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>She won a third term as district attorney while he was imprisoned.</td></tr>
