<h3>Boehner: Clinton needs to bring Democrats along on trade</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>House Speaker John Boehner says Hillary Rodham Clinton needs to back trade legislation that President Barack Obama wants - and help get Democrats on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Boehner says Republican votes alone aren't enough to give Obama the negotiating authority to complete an Asia-Pacific trade deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He tells NBC's "Meet the Press" that Obama "needs her help" and Clinton should be more involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Boehner says Clinton "can't sit on the sidelines and let the president swing in the wind."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Presidential candidate Clinton so far is noncommittal about a trade deal she promoted as Obama's secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And she says any deal must produce U.S. jobs, raise wages and protect American security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Liberals and labor unions worry that that the pact would cost American jobs and lower environmental standards.</td></tr>
