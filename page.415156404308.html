<h3>UN warns against complacency as Ebola fight enters tough new phase</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.N. experts said Monday that the spread of the disease in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone has dropped to almost 10 percent of what it was in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But U.N. Special Envoy on Ebola David Nabarro said the fight has reached a "second phase, getting to zero, and it really is the hardest part."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ebola has infected nearly 24,000 people and killed more than 9,600, according to World Health Organization statistics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nabarro said eradicating the disease requires treating all those who are ill and tracking everyone they come in contact with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's a really difficult, painstaking task," he said in Brussels, on the eve of a major international conference on Ebola expected to draw around 600 delegates, including the leaders of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to U.N. figures, the number of new cases has dropped from some 800-900 per week at the height of the outbreak to around 100 per week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are reaching the most difficult phase, where there is a fatigue among the governments among the population, certainly among the donors, and we are not yet there," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The outbreak is focused in an area of West Africa about the size of France, with a population of about 20 million people, and where infrastructure is limited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ebola has cost the three countries an estimated 12 percent of their gross domestic product, shifted resources causing other health care problems, and hurt business as people became scared to leave their homes or go to markets.</td></tr>

<h3>California court rules San Diego sex offender law unconstitutional</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>California's top court issued the ruling in a legal challenge to "Jessica's Law" by four registered sex offenders from San Diego who argued that the restrictions on where they could live infringed on their rights under the state and federal constitutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, saying such residency restrictions were legal only when they were based on specific circumstances of each parolee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That decision was upheld by an appeals court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Blanket enforcement of residency restrictions against these parolees has ... infringed on their liberty and privacy interests, however limited, while bearing no rational relationship to advancing the state's legitimate goal of protecting children from sexual predators," Justice Marvin Baxter wrote in an opinion for the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The judge added the restrictions violated the plaintiffs' "basic constitutional right to be free of unreasonable, arbitrary and oppressive official action."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Jessica's Law, a ballot measure approved by California voters in 2006, makes it illegal for registered sex offenders to live within 2,000 feet (600 meters) of any school or park where children regularly gather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A study conducted by the San Diego County District Attorney's Office found that huge parts of San Diego, including virtually all the downtown area, were off-limits to offenders subject to those restrictions and that they were largely shut out of the rental housing market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The residency restrictions place burdens on registered sex offender parolees that are disruptive in a way that hinder their treatment, jeopardizes their health and undercuts their ability to find and maintain employment, significantly undermining any effort at rehabilitation," Baxter wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The court's ruling applied only to San Diego's enforcement of Jessica's Law, named after a 9-year-old Florida girl who was kidnapped, raped and murdered by a man who lived near her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But it could provide an opportunity for sex offenders in other major California cities to challenge the restrictions based on similar arguments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A spokesman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said the agency was reviewing the Supreme Court's decision.</td></tr>
