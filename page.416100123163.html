<h3>Facebook Sued By 25,000 Users Over Privacy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook is being sued in Austria over alleged privacy violations and claimed participation in the US National Security Agency's (NSA) PRISM programme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An Austrian law graduate called Max Schrems is leading the class action lawsuit on behalf of around 25,000 Facebook users based in Europe and beyond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Among them are more than 1,000 people from the UK and Ireland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Germany, regarded as one of Europe's more privacy-conscious countries, has the highest number of people backing the case with more than 5,000 users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The hearing is set to begin in Vienna, where Mr Schrems will say Facebook took a "Wild West" approach to data protection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said: "Basically, we are asking Facebook to stop mass surveillance, to (have) a proper privacy policy that people can understand, but also to stop collecting data of people that are not even Facebook users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"There is a wide number of issues in the lawsuit and we hope to kind of win all of them and to get a landmark case against US data-gathering companies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>All accounts outside the US and Canada are registered there - around 80% of the site's 1.3 billion users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Schrems is seeking compensation of around 360 per user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In June 2013 Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg denied that Facebook had taken part in the NSA's spying programme to share user information with the US government.</td></tr>
