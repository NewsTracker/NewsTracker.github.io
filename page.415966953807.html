<h3>Grief turns to anger as details of Kenya university massacre emerge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Strapped with explosives, masked al Shabaab gunmen stormed the Garissa University College campus, some 200 km (120 miles) from the Somali border, in a pre-dawn rampage on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tossing grenades and spraying bullets at cowering students, the attackers initially killed indiscriminately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But they later freed some Muslims and instead targeted Christian students during a siege that lasted about 15 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Survivors of the Garissa attack spoke of merciless executions by the attackers, who stalked classrooms and dormitories hunting for non-Muslim students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Reuben Mwavita, 21, a student, said he saw three female students kneeling in front of the gunmen, begging for mercy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The mistake they made was to say 'Jesus, please save us', because that is when they were immediately shot," Mwavita said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some students were killed as they spoke to their parents on the telephone, having been ordered to call with messages from the four gunmen that their aim was to force Kenyan troops to leave Somalia, a senior Kenyan government source told The Telegraph of London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This is the level of depravity that we are dealing with. It is something beyond the comprehension of anyone normal like you or I," the source, who spoke anonymously, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"These are not people who can be reasoned with, only force can stop them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Anger over the massacre was compounded by the fact there were warnings last week that an attack on a university was imminent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Five people have been arrested in connection with the attack, CNN reported on Friday, citing Kenyan Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Officials said almost 150 people died, with at least 79 wounded, many critically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But with an uncertain number of students and staff still missing, the casualties may yet mount.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Outside the university gates, a throng of veiled women clung to the hope that missing people would still turn up alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The violence will heap further pressure on President Uhur Kenyatta, who has struggled to stop frequent militant gun and grenade attacks that have dented Kenya's image abroad and brought the country's vital tourism industry to its knees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>US President Obama will make a long-awaited return to Kenya this July, visiting his father's homeland for the first time since becoming US president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I know firsthand the extraordinary resilience and fundamental decency of the people of Kenya. So I know that the people of Garissa and all of Kenya will grieve but their determination to achieve a better and more secure future will not be deterred," Mr Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>More than 400 people have been killed by al Qaeda-allied al Shabaab in the east African nation since Kenyatta took office in April 2013, including some 67 people who died in a blitz on a shopping mall in the capital Nairobi in September of that year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Al Shabaab says its recent wave of attacks are retribution for Kenya sending troops into Somalia to fight the group alongside other African Union peacekeepers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Within hours of the attack, Kenya put up a 20 million shillings ($215,000) reward for the arrest of Mohamed Mohamud, a former Garissa teacher labelled "Most Wanted" in a government poster and linked by Kenyan media to two separate al Shabaab attacks in the neighbouring Mandera region last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The government also imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on Garissa, Mandera and two other crime-ridden regions near the porous border with Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>However, diplomats and analysts say the move effectively concedes the government cannot control those areas, widely seen as Kenya's soft underbelly.</td></tr>
