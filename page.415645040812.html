<h3>Notre Dame tops Butler 67-64 in overtime for Sweet 16 berth (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>''Very rarely did I get 'Hey, Mike, how you doing?''' Brey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>''It's like 'Have you got them ready?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Are they ready?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>I think we can beat Duke, Mike.' It's unbelievable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It came with the territory for Betty Brey Mullen, an Olympic swimmer who briefly held a butterfly world record and instilled in her three children the tenacity they carry with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Brey relied on it heavily on Saturday night, guiding the Irish to a thrilling 67-64 win over in-state rival Butler in the NCAA Tournament and a spot in the Sweet 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Brey took the floor just hours after Betty died in Florida at the age of 84 following a heart attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If Brey is being honest, he still was in shock at tip-off but responded by doing what he's done since he slipped out of swimming practice for basketball camp when he was 9: he hung in there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''It was kind of a tribute to her,'' Brey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One that ended with the surging Irish (31-5) in the regional semifinals for the first time since 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Jerian Grant scored 16 points for Notre Dame, including the clinching layup with 18 seconds left to put an abrupt end to Butler's latest NCAA Tournament run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Steve Vasturia led Notre Dame with 20 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Demetrius Jackson added 13 points, and Zach Auguste had seven points and 13 rebounds for the Irish, who beat the Bulldogs for the first time in 26 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While Notre Dame rejoiced in the locker room, its coach made plans to travel to Florida on Sunday to celebrate his mother's life and watch Wichita State and Kansas play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The winner faces the Irish on Thursday in Cleveland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Including leading Notre Dame to its deepest tournament run in a dozen years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The ACC Tournament champions are used to tight games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They didn't blink when Butler did what Butler always does this time of year: rally from an early deficit to push a higher-seeded opponent to the brink.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''We had the game where we wanted it,'' Butler coach Chris Holtmann said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Roosevelt Jones played through an injured left knee while scoring 23 points for Butler (23-11), but the Bulldogs never led in the extra session after missing on two chances to win in regulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Notre Dame senior guard Connaughton slammed Dunham's shot from the corner into the ground and senior center Kameron Woods couldn't convert an out of bounds alley-oop at the buzzer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Connaughton shouted ''not tonight'' after his block.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>And he was right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Connaughton snapped a 59-all tie with a 3-pointer from the right corner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Kellen Dunham got the Bulldogs within a point with two free throws, but the Irish drilled their sixth - and last - 3-pointer of the game when Vasturia knocked down a shot from the same spot as Connaughton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Grant - a senior who missed most of the 2013-14 season due to an academic issue - then split the defense and laid it in with the shot clock nearing zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''We made big plays down the stretch, we've been doing that all year,'' Grant said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''We're playing with a lot of confidence right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The two schools separated by 147 miles of Indiana highway met regularly from 1908-95, but had played just once in the last 20 years, a win by the Bulldogs in the preseason NIT in 2006.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The balance of power between the programs has shifted mightily in two decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Bulldogs are a March fixture with a pair of memorable national title game appearances since 2010 alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The Irish have been modestly successful under Brey, but have struggled to translate regular-season wins into lengthy tournament stays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The Irish promised this spring would be different.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>They shot their way to an improbable ACC Tournament title, beating Duke and North Carolina behind an efficient offense and an ability to limit mistakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>It's a formula that has worked for Butler during its rise from mid-major marvel to newly minted citizen of the rejiggered Big East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The Bulldogs overcame the abrupt departure of coach Brandon Miller in October with gritty, grind-it-out defense and a relentless commitment to rebounding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Notre Dame led by as much as 10 in the first half but the Bulldogs would not go away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Wearing reams of tape, compression pants and an unwieldy brace, Jones kept finding open space to get Butler back in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Butler: Jones said he would have to be ''tackled'' to be kept out of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He made 9 of 19 shots while playing 44 of the game's 45 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>... Senior guard Alex Barlow shot just 1 of 6 and missed all four of his 3-point attempts before fouling out early in overtime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Notre Dame: Connaughton played in his school-record 137th game, breaking mark he shared with former point guard Tory Jackson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>... Jackson made 4 of 8 shots two days after being raked across the eyes late in the round of 64 win over Northeastern and complaining of blurred vision afterward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Butler loses seniors Woods and Barlow, but returns Dunham and Jones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Notre Dame will try reach the regional final for the first time since 1979.</td></tr>
