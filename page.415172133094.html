<h3>Boko Haram beheadings video echoes Isis techniques</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The film, released on Monday, opens with two men on their knees, their hands tied behind their backs, and a militant standing over them holding a knife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One of the kneeling men is made to tell the camera that they were paid by authorities to spy on the group, before another scene shows the men's decapitated bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was not possible to confirm the film's authenticity or date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The use of graphics, footage of black-clad militants with a black flag, and editing to show only the aftermath of the beheadings are particularly similar to footage from Isis, which has seized large parts of Iraq and Syria and killed several hostages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The footage will stoke concerns that Boko Haram, which evolved out of a clerical movement focused on north-east Nigeria, is expanding its scope and seeking inspiration from global militant networks including al-Qaida and Isis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The group has killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds in a drive to carve out an Islamist state in the country, and in recent months has increased its number of cross-border raids into Cameroon, Chad and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nigeria's president, Goodluck Jonathan, has said that Boko Haram is allied to both al-Qaida and Isis, though that has not been confirmed by the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the film, one of the men says he comes from Baga, in Borno state, and the other says he is from Michika, in Adamawa state- areas in which the army says it has recently recaptured territory from the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Past Boko Haram films have been cruder, often featuring a man identified as the leader Abubakar Shekau discussing local gripes instead of preaching global jihad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But recent videos have featured increasingly gruesome footage of beheadings.</td></tr>

<h3>Japanese island overrun with cats after population explodes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Aoshima, a tiny island located in Miyazaki province off the southern coast of Japan, officially has less than 20 people in residence - but over 120 feral cats, outnumbering the humans by six to one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The animals were originally brought over to control a mice infestation, but with no natural predators - and a dwindling supply of mice - the number of cats soon got out of hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Humans first inhabited the 1.6km island roughly 380 years ago and in 1945 the island was home to approximately 900 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But as the local fishing industry declined so did the human population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Now, the 20-odd individuals who still live on the island - known locally as Cats Islands - are pensioners, with tourism the island's main source of income.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>About a decade ago, as the number of people declined, the cat population shot up as their breeding went unchecked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Efforts are being made to cull the feline community - roughly 10 animals have recently been spayed - but progress is slow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Most of the cats have become feral with fewer and fewer humans to feed them, but they survive mainly on the rice balls, energy bars or potatoes tourists, who visit from the mainland, give them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"If people coming to the island find the cats healing, then I think it's a good thing," 65-year-old Hidenori Kamimoto, who makes a living as a fisherman, told ABC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I just hope that it's done in a way that doesn't become a burden on the people who live here."</td></tr>
