<h3>Sue Lamb 'stressed out' after $10 MILLION is deposited in her bank account</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sue Lamb, 49, from Labrador, was shocked when she used an ATM to withdraw $100 from her ANZ credit account on Saturday and the bank receipt said her available balance was $9,990,420.94.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ms Lamb said she called ANZ to inform them of the error but claims a customer service agent told her it was her money and there was nothing he could do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>'They've really caused grave stress for my family,' she told Daily Mail Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ms Lamb said the money had been added to the limit on her credit card - an account she didn't usually use to withdraw cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'I never use that credit card to withdraw cash ever,' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ms Lamb said when she spoke to a customer service agent on Sunday he first insisted the money was hers, and then told her she would have to ring back during business hours on Monday if she had any concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'I said "It's not my money" and he said "But it's a compound of all your company's funds", but I don't have a company, I'm a sole trader,' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'This gentleman didn't seem too concerned, he was more concerned with telling me that they were my funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On Monday morning Ms Lamb still had not heard from the bank, and had checked her account again to find the $10 million was gone and she was listed as being $7500 in debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'It's just ridiculous, I mean they've put $10 million credit on my credit card,' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'Now the fact is they've put me in debt $7500.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It's someone's debt but it's not mine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'This happened on Valentine's Day, so the CEO of ANZ must want to marry me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An ANZ spokeswoman said Ms Lamb had chosen to have an 'unlimited monthly spend cap' on her account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'The available balance on the BOQ ATM receipt refers to the amount of the monthly spend cap rather than the available credit,' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'We're investigating why the BOQ's receipt is showing the monthly spend cap rather than the actual balance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In 2012, a New Zealand petrol station owner was sentenced to four years and seven months in jail after going on the run when a bank error mistakenly transferred $NZ10 million into his account.</td></tr>

<h3>Bali nine lawyers beg Attorney-General to delay transfer to Nusakambangan island</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The lawyers are challenging President Joko Widodo's rejection of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's clemency pleas in the administrative court in Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But despite the legal challenge, the head of Bali's prosecutor's office said on Monday the men would this week be transferred to Nusakambangan island ahead of their execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The men's lawyer, Todung Mulya Lubis said it was hard to reverse the transfer to the penal island once they were moved there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"For the sake of justice and fairness, I think it's fair for the Attorney-General to wait for all legal processes to finish," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Mulya said that on Friday the legal team had also sent a letter to the judicial committee regarding allegations by former lawyer Muhammad Rifan that there had been political intervention when the judges imposed the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However a judge involved in the case, Wayan Yasa Abadi, denied there had been political interference or bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said he would respond if summonsed by the judicial committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's legal team is claiming in the administrative court that justice was not served because Mr Joko did not assess the men's clemency pleas individually and take into account their reformation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Instead, the president said all 64 drug felons on death row would be executed due to the drug crisis facing Indonesia, with 50 to 60 people dying as a result of drugs every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>These figures have been criticised for being based on dubious projections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Mulya said he had tried to meet with Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo to request a delay for the transfer but he had been in a meeting with the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We have the summons from the administrative court that we have to appear before the head of the administrative court next Tuesday," Mr Mulya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This is the evidence that the legal process is still going on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He said he hoped Chan and Sukumaran were not transferred to Nusakambangan island - let alone executed - while the legal process was still underway.</td></tr>
