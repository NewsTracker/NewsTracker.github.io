<h3>Ferguson PD chief still in, but two veteran commanders out</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Meanwhile, three Ferguson employees implicated in racist emails exposed by that report are now gone from their jobs, the mayor said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One was identified as a city court clerk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The other two were identified by the St. Louis Post Dispatch, and later confirmed by CBS News, as veteran police officials Capt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Rick Henke and Sgt. William Mudd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>City spokesman Jeff Small confirmed to CBS News Friday that those three staff changes are the only ones that have taken place since the DOJ report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Calls for Jackson's removal were renewed again this week after the Justice Department cleared Darren Wilson, the white former Ferguson officer who shot Michael Brown, of federal civil rights charges in the death of the 18-year-old, who was black and unarmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A second report released simultaneously found patterns of racial profiling, bigotry and profit-driven law enforcement and court practices in the St. Louis suburb that has come to represent the tension between minorities and American police nationwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Asked about Jackson in an interview with The Associated Press, Mayor James Knowles III said only, "He's still the chief."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Knowles said city leaders are evaluating the Justice Department report "line by line" before deciding on reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His focus now is on understanding the report, then moving forward with whatever changes are needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I'm not here to just chop heads," Knowles said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We have to evaluate everything in the report, pick out what are the systemic issues and what are the things we can fix."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some civil rights leaders and lawmakers have called for Jackson to resign or be fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Jackson did not respond to interview requests on Friday but has repeatedly said he would not step down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ferguson city leaders will meet with Justice Department officials in about two weeks and provide a plan for improving the police force and the municipal court system, Knowles said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They want to hear what we will do," Knowles said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We're going to hopefully work out some sort of agreement and we'll move forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We've got to come up with solutions now," Knowles said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Some experts believe the first step toward a solution is change at the top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Larry Cunningham, professor and associate dean at St. John's University School of Law in Queens, New York, said the removal of the chief is key to healing the racial wounds in the suburb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"He should absolutely not stay in office and should step down," said Cunningham, a former prosecutor in Virginia and the Bronx.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The report details a widespread pattern and practice of abuse and discrimination and dysfunction. Because it is widespread and systemic throughout the entire police department, the buck stops at the top - the person in charge, and that's the chief."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The report uncovered racist emails from several city employees, including some that belittled black residents or President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Knowles said three employees responsible for the emails ended their employment with the city on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He declined to say if they were fired or resigned and would not provide their names or titles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But Ferguson city spokesman Jeff Small identified one of the employees as court clerk Mary Ann Twitty, who was fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He said the other two employees worked for the police department, but he did not name them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A message left for Twitty was not returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The mayor said he first learned of the emails Wednesday after meeting with Justice Department officials in St. Louis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He said he was so incensed that he ordered the accounts of all three employees disabled while he was in the car returning to Ferguson after the meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Knowles said there was no evidence that Jackson or other police administrators were aware of the emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The Justice Department report on the police department found that black drivers were more than twice as likely as others to be searched during routine traffic stops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Minority residents bear the burden of fines and court costs expected to generate $3 million this fiscal year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Black residents were more likely to face excessive force from police, often during unwarranted stops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Some have called on the city to dissolve the 54-officer police force and allow either St. Louis County or a neighboring municipality to take over patrols.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Knowles said there is "zero" percent chance of that happening.</td></tr>

<h3>Ohio man jailed in terror plot says he would have shot Obama</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WXIX-TV in Cincinnati said Christopher Lee Cornell called it from the Kentucky jail where he's being held, confessed to being a supporter of the Islamic State group and said he planned to kill government officials in retaliation for U.S. strikes on the militant organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The station aired part of the interview Friday night, hours after Cornell's attorney argued unsuccessfully in court that it could violate the defendant's right to a fair trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Cornell, asked by the interviewer what he would have done had he not been arrested in January, said he would have taken one of his guns, "I would have put it to Obama's head, I would have pulled the trigger, then I would unleash more bullets on the Senate and House of Representative members, and I would have attacked the Israeli embassy and various other buildings."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Cornell, who repeatedly identified himself as Muslim, said he wanted to carry out the attack because of "the continued American aggression against our people and the fact that America, specifically President Obama, wants to wage war against Islamic State."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said: "They might say I'm a terrorist, but you know we see American troops as terrorists as well, coming to our land, stealing our resources and killing our people, raping our women."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Cornell, 20, grew up in the Cincinnati suburbs and still lived with his parents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said support of the Islamic State group is widespread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We're here in Ohio. We're in every state," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We're more organized than you think."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>At times what seemed like a nervous chuckle punctuated his responses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said he would do whatever the Islamic State group asked of him, including beheading Americans, and predicted "there will be many, many attacks."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A federal indictment charges Cornell with two counts that carry possible sentences of up to 20 years each upon conviction: attempted murder of government employees and officials and solicitation to commit a crime of violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He also faces a firearms-related charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He has pleaded not guilty and awaits trial in Cincinnati.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Cornell was arrested outside a gun shop near his home on Jan. 14 after the FBI said he bought two M-15 assault weapons and 600 rounds of ammunition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The FBI said in court documents that Cornell planned to "wage jihad" by attacking the Capitol with pipe bombs and shooting government officials and employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Cornell was coerced and misled by "a snitch" trying to better his own legal situation, his father said.</td></tr>
