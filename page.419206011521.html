<h3>Activist in search for missing students killed in Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Miguel Angel Jimenez, a political activist who played a prominent early role in the search for 43 students and other missing people in southern Mexico, was slain over the weekend, an associate said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bullet-ridden body of Jimenez, a member of the Union of Towns and Organizations, or UPOEG for its initials in Spanish, was found in a car near a town where he had helped found a community police program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>UPOEG leader Bruno Placido confirmed the death and said Jimenez had received threats related to his search efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jimenez began organizing searches for 43 teachers' college students who went missing after they were detained by police last September in Guerrero state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prosecutors say corrupt local police in the city of Iguala turned the students over to members of a drug cartel, the Guerreros Unidos, who killed the students and incinerated their bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the searches Jimenez led into the mountains surrounding the city turned up clandestine graves filled with other bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Placido said the death threats may have come from Guerreros Unidos and Jimenez had returned to his hometown of Xaltianguis in Guerrero to be safer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jimenez was found dead on the outskirts of Xaltianguis, and relatives buried him there Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jimenez played a key role in expanding the search effort to include hundreds of other Iguala residents whose relatives disappeared during the cartel's reign of kidnappings and killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While he gradually relinquished leadership of the search efforts after November, he continued to supply information and said he had new leads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He was always looking for somebody to help," said Xitlali Miranda, one of the activists in the Iguala searches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In July, Mexico's attorney general's office confirmed that at least 60 clandestine graves with 129 bodies have been found so far on the outskirts of Iguala.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Most of the bodies remain unidentified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Jimenez also organized community police efforts to fight kidnappings, killings and extortion by criminal gangs, and drives to document vote fraud in June's midterm elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In an April interview with Kara Andrade, a doctoral student at American University, Jimenez said he had received death threats from "people who are involved in things and whose interests I have impacted."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They've chased me, in my town (Xaltianguis) they've tailed and followed me from place to place," Jimenez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Still he kept up his activism in Guerrero, a state plagued by drug trafficking and cultivation, gang battles, extortion, illegal logging and land disputes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I don't do this because of me or the abuses we live now. I do this for the next generation and for my children," Jimenez said.</td></tr>
