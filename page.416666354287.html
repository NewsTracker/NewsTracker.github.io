<h3>Rainfall in Area of Chile Volcano Could Cause Mudslides</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A thick plume pours from the Calbuco volcano near Puerto Montt, Chile, Thursday, April 30, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The volcano erupted again on Thursday, sending dark burst of ash and hot rock billowing into the air and prompting Chilean officials to order new evacuation of nearby residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The eruptions at the Calbuco are the first in more than four decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Authorities in southern Chile say rain over the weekend could cause problems related to the Calbuco volcano's eruptions over the last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Chile's weather service said Friday that up to a half inch (15 millimeters) of rain is expected to fall on the area, raising the possibility of mudslides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>About 6,600 people living near the volcano remain evacuated after Calbuco erupted Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The volcano, about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) south of Santiago, erupted twice last week, sending heavy ash and smoke into the sky that coated several cities and caused the cancelations of many flights in Chile and neighboring Argentina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Thursday's eruption was smaller, but the National Geology and Mineral Service warns that more eruptions are possible and says the volcano could be spewing some ash and smoke for months.</td></tr>
