<h3>Sepp Blatter says he will resign as FIFA president and calls for fresh election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Walking away: Sepp Blatter resigns as president of FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Zurich: Sepp Blatter has said he will resign as president of FIFA in the wake of a widening corruption inquiry, an extraordinary turn just four days after he was re-elected, and defiantly insisted that he was blameless and committed to cleaning up the organisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Blatter, 79, said he would ask FIFA to schedule a new election for his replacement as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The next FIFA congress is May 2016, but he acknowledged that the organisation could not wait long for new leadership given the current situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Goodbye: FIFA president Sepp Blatter in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>At a brief, hastily convened news conference in Zurich, Mr Blatter said that "FIFA needs a profound restructuring."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I appreciate and love FIFA more than anything else," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"And I only want to do the best for FIFA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"While I have a mandate from the membership of FIFA, I do not feel I have a mandate from the entire world of football - the fans, the players, the clubs, the people who live, breathe and love football as much as we all do at FIFA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Miskick: Sepp Blatter misses the ball in Munich, 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Blatter declined to take questions after his remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Just days ago, he referred to himself as the "president of everybody, [including] those associations who voted against me. This has no impact on my view for the future".</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Blatter is regarded as the most powerful executive in sports, ruling FIFA autocratically while brushing off frequent accusations that the organisation was corrupt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He has worked for FIFA since 1975, and has been president since 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Blatter says Friday's election "does not seem to be supported by everybody in the world of football."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Domenico Scala of Italy, who leads the FIFA audit and compliance committee, will take the lead in managing this handover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said reforms would include "fundamental changes" to the way FIFA is structured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Scala said that based on FIFA statutes a four-month notice is required for any presidential elections to be held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr Blatter was re-elected for to fifth term on Friday, winning a 133-73 vote over Jordanian Prince Ali bin al-Hussein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After Mr Blatter's resignation, Prince Ali said he would stand in the new elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Football Federation Australia president Frank Lowy voted for Prince Ali on Friday and was unhappy with the re-election of Mr Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>While Mr Blatter was not mentioned in either the US or Swiss investigations, there were widespread calls for him to quit, mostly from Western nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Some major sponsors also expressed misgivings about the impact of the scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>On Monday, reports linked FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke, Mr Blatter's right-hand man, to a $US10 million payment sent to former FIFA Vice President Jack Warner in exchange for what prosecutors say was a positive vote on South Africa's bid for the 2010 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mr Valcke was not present on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The $US10 million was taken out of the operating budget for that year's World Cup and transferred by FIFA in 2008 to an account controlled by Mr Warner, ostensibly to fund something called the "Diaspora Legacy Programme."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>All of this was detailed in a letter sent from the South African Football Association to Valcke in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In a statement released on Tuesday, FIFA claimed the program supported "the African diaspora in Caribbean countries as part of the World Cup legacy" and that neither Mr Valcke "nor any other member of FIFA's senior management were involved in the initiation, approval and implementation of the above project."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>However, the program's name did not appear in any official FIFA documents until the letter was uncovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Last week's indictments and Mr Valcke's alleged corruption were only the latest scandals faced by FIFA under Mr Blatter's reign, which began in 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>FIFA itself investigated the bidding processes involved in the votes to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, a nation with inhospitable summer weather and almost zero soccer tradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Michael Garcia, a former US prosecutor, spearheaded the investigation, but the organisation has refused to release his full report, instead releasing only a summary that Mr Garcia declared a whitewash before resigning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Mr Blatter turned FIFA into a financial behemoth, with billions in the bank as advertisers and television networks across the globe lined up to link their names to the World Cup, the world's most-watched sporting event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>In turn, Mr Blatter dispersed this largesse to the confederations of the world's smaller soccer-playing nations, who then promised to support him during presidential elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Under FIFA's electoral process, each confederation gets one vote, meaning the smallest nations have the same amount of power as titans such as Germany, Italy, Spain and Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Thus, Mr Blatter maintained his stranglehold on the presidency until the mounting corruption charges toppled his reign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Sepp Blatter says he will resign as FIFA...</td></tr>
