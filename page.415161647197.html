<h3>North Korea lifts Ebola travel restrictions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The already isolated country virtually closed its borders to foreigners last October, halting all non-essential visas and requiring those few foreigners allowed in to undergo three weeks of quarantine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The rules applied to diplomats, NGO workers and even senior North Korean officials returning from overseas trips.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>One tour company that takes tourists into North Korea, Uri Tours, said on its website Tuesday that it had been told by the country's national airline that the ban had been lifted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We have been informed by Air Koryo that North Korea's borders are now open for travel and the four-month long Ebola travel ban was lifted as of Monday," Uri Tours said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Officials in Pyongyang said the restrictions and quarantines would continue for visitors from Ebola-affected countries in Africa and those countries that have borders with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>North Korean media had suggested the Ebola virus was created by the U.S. military for use as a biological weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>North Korea's decision to set the restrictions despite the lack of any real threat " there have been no Ebola cases in Asia and North Korea has very little exchange with the African countries that have been most impacted " has been a disaster for foreign travel agencies that specialize in bringing tourists to the North.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A statement from North Korea's state emergency quarantine committee obtained by The AP on Tuesday said tourists from Ebola-hit countries such as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and their neighboring countries would still be placed in the three-week quarantine, while tourists from other countries would be able to enter with routine medical checks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>North Korea had been pushing tourism in hopes of gaining much-needed foreign currency and has over the past few years tried to improve its tourism infrastructure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Last year, it opened its first luxury ski resort and it has announced the establishment of a number of special tourism zones across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It is mainly targeting tourists from China, but an increasing number of tourists are coming from the West as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"They have confirmed to me that the borders are now open and everything is back to normal," Andrea Lee, the New Jersey-based Uri Tours' CEO, said in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"As we need about two weeks to process visas, we're planning to start tours again from the middle of March."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But the lifting of the restrictions appears to come too late for one of the year's biggest tourist events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Officials have already announced that foreigners will not be able to participate in the Pyongyang marathon next month, although they might have time to reverse that decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The marathon was opened to foreign recreational runners for the first time last year and was a big success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Travel agents said they expected hundreds of runners from abroad to join this year, but had to cancel their bookings at the last minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Uri Tours said it is waiting for more information to see what the lifting of the ban means for the marathon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>North Korea has also indicated that it will not hold its popular Arirang mass games extravaganza this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The mass games are another big tourist attraction.</td></tr>

<h3>Appeals court upholds protection for threatened seabird</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - A federal appeals court has rejected a lawsuit by the timber industry seeking to strip Endangered Species Act protection from a threatened seabird that nests in old-growth forests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Environmentalists say the ruling Friday by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., should mark the end of a 15-year legal battle over logging trees used by marbled murrelets along the coasts of Oregon, Washington and northern California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The American Forest Resources Council had argued that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acted arbitrarily and capriciously in designating the U.S. population of marbled murrelets distinct from birds in Canada, despite a line in the law saying political boundaries are a valid reason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The appeals court found the decision did not depart from standard practice, and it let stand a district court ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The big picture is that we are disappointed in our continued inability to get the judicial branch of our government to exert some control over the administrative branches' overzealous interpretation in favor of the marbled murrelet," said Ann Forest Burns, vice president of the American Forest Resource Council in Portland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's not about the bird. It's about logging. It's the bird du jour."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kristen Boyles, an attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice, said she felt the reason the timber industry has been willing to fight so hard to remove protections for the marbled murrelet is that it is not as charismatic as the northern spotted owl, which was the prime focus of lawsuits that cut logging by 90 percent on national forests in the Northwest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The marbled murrelet is a robin-sized bird that feeds and lives on the ocean, but it flies as much as 50 miles inland to lay a single egg in a mossy depression on a large tree branch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While much of the battle over logging in the Northwest has gone on over habitat for spotted owls and salmon on national forests, the marbled murrelet was the reason the Oregon Department of Forestry withdrew two dozen timber sales on the Elliott State Forest outside Coos Bay last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Under a federal court order, the marbled murrelet was listed as a threatened species in 1992 in Oregon, Washington and California because of the loss of nesting habitat to commercial logging, the loss of fish to eat to gillnetting and oil spills.</td></tr>
