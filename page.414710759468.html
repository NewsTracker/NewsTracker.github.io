<h3>Al Jazeera's Mohamed Fahmy released on bail in Egypt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He was released from prison in Egypt on bail pending a retrial on Friday, Feb. 13, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jailed Al Jazeera journalist Mohamed Fahmy has been released from prison in Egypt on bail pending a retrial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>His release early on Friday morning comes a day after an Egyptian court granted bail to Fahmy and his colleague Baher Mohamed after they spent 411 days in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The retrial was ordered by the country's Court of Cassation last month, overturning a lower court that found them guilty of helping the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Bail is a small step in the right direction and allows Baher and Mohamed to spend time with their families after 411 days apart," an Al Jazeera spokesman said on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The focus, though, is still on the court reaching the correct verdict at the next hearing by dismissing this absurd case and releasing both these fine journalists unconditionally."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Judge Hassan Farid said the next hearing would be on Feb. 23.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A third Al Jazeera journalist, Peter Greste, who was also to be retried, was deported on Feb. 1 under a presidential decree after spending 400 days in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He has since returned to his home in Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The three journalists, along with seven colleagues outside the country, were accused of spreading "false news" during their coverage of demonstrations protesting a military overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Greste, Fahmy and Mohamed were given sentences of seven to 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In a bid to secure his release, Fahmy renounced his Egyptian citizenship so he could be deported to Canada, where he is also a citizen.</td></tr>
