<h3>Harvard's Julio Frenk named as University of Miami president; is a former official in Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The school's board of trustees unanimously approved Frenk's selection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He'll take office Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>1, three months after former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala's tenure ends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Shalala, who has been president since 2001, succeeded in raising the profile of a school now consistently ranked among the nation's top 50 colleges and universities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"President Shalala was one of the most highly respected voices, a leading voice in international health," Frenk, 61, told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There's no question that she had such a successful tenure here, and that was very attractive in making this a very attractive opportunity for me. I think she's done a great job of improving the university."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Frenk had been the dean of the faculty at Harvard's School of Public Health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He introduced comprehensive universal health care to Mexican citizens during his tenure there and is the author of two books for young people about the workings of the body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Shalala departs June 1 and will take over as President of the Clinton Foundation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Provost Thomas LeBlanc will serve as Interim President until Frenk's inauguration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Frenk said his transition into the new role is already underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Frenk told the AP there were three major reasons for wanting the Miami job: The school's "upward momentum," as he put it; its geographic location with Miami being a gateway connecting Latin America and the Caribbean to the U.S.; and how it's a new chance for him to put his own stamp on something significant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Frenk's wife, Dr. Felicia Knaul - an associate Harvard professor, a breast cancer survivor and research and advocacy advocate - will also be joining Miami as a faculty member in the fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I am certain that he will further transform the University of Miami as a leading educational force for the Americas and for the world," said former President of Mexico Vicente Fox.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Frenk's expertise in fundraising was a key point for Miami's search committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Miami is wrapping up its second Momentum fundraising campaign under Shalala, with a total of about $3 billion raised for the school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In his six years at Harvard, Frenk quadrupled fundraising and helped land a $350 million naming gift for the School of Public Health - the largest single gift in Harvard's 378-year history.</td></tr>
