<h3>Undertaker says no word on Bali Nine pair</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran remain on death row in Bali after plans to move them to Nusakambangan island for their executions stalled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo says no new date for the move has been set, with agencies still planning the movement of prisoners for the mass execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Besides the Bali Nine duo, seven other drug offenders on death row are in line for execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The attorney-general's department says also that Nusakambangan island, home to several prisons off Central Java, does not have adequate isolation cells.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And the funeral director at Javanese Christian Church in Cilacap, the nearest mainland town to Nusakambangan, says he has not yet been told to prepare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Suhendro Putro says he's ordering extra coffins anyway after having to scramble to fill the police order last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Five drug offenders were executed on January 18, but Mr Suhendro had only three coffins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He was also asked to find more people to help prepare the bodies for burial, including one familiar with Buddhist funeral rites, and ambulances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As of Friday, he hadn't been told to get ready for more executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"What can I say? I haven't been told. I am usually told," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The coffins are ordered from the city of Yogyakarta and it takes time, Mr Suhendro said, "so they can't tell me all of a sudden".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There has been speculation that the executions could be delayed for up to a month, after a spokesman for Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla was quoted in local media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Kalla took a phone call on Thursday from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who reportedly thanked his government for delaying the transfer, enabling Chan and Sukumaran to spend more time with family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>According to his spokesman, Husain Abdullah, Mr Kalla told Ms Bishop the executions had been delayed "three weeks to one month" because of technical issues, some local media reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, Ms Bishop and Mr Prasetyo deny the length of the delay was discussed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At Kerobokan jail on Friday, meetings to plan the transfer to Nusakambangan jail continued, but no date was set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"As soon as Nusakambangan is ready, we'll send them immediately," Bali chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso told reporters.</td></tr>

<h3>U.N. climate panel chief accused of sexual harassment: police</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The woman, who is a researcher at Pachauri's Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), claims the 74-year-old Indian scientist began harassing her soon after she joined the non-profit think-tank in September 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pachauri has denied the charges, according to a court order sent to the Thomson Reuters Foundation by the public relations firm acting on behalf by TERI.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Pachauri's office said he was unavailable to comment and his lawyers refused to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There are a few charges we are investigating," said a police official, who did not want to be named.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The case comes at a difficult time as Pachauri is playing a key role in the run-up to a crucial climate change summit in Paris in December where world leaders are expected to agree a new deal to curb global warming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He is due to speak at an IPCC event in Nairobi on Monday and attend a major meeting there for the rest of the week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The IPCC, however, will elect a new chair at a session planned for October and Pachauri, who was first elected as the panel's chair in 2002, will not stand for a third term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The lawyers for the woman, who cannot be named, said the harassment included unwanted emails, text and WhatsApp messages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prashant Mendiratta, one of the woman's lawyers, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that victim had asked Pachauri to refrain from sending her messages, but that he had persisted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Pachauri was granted a court injunction against the media reporting the case on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the court order, Pachauri's lawyers claim his emails, mobile phone and WhatsApp messages were hacked and that cyber criminals accessed his computer and phone to send the messages in an attempt to malign him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It is urged that the plaintiff is being targeted by various vested interests," said the court order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Wednesday, the Delhi High Court changed its decision saying it had to keep "in view the liberty of the press" and lifted the injunction against the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Pachauri has been granted anticipatory bail by the court until Feb. 23 which means police cannot take him into custody until then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Sources close to Pachauri said that he has given police access to his mobile phone and computer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Pachauri has been the chair of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 2002, and is one of the world's leading voices on the issue of global warming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In 2007, the IPCC was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore for their part in galvanizing international action against climate change.</td></tr>
