<h3>Baltimore Mom of the Year: ?I don?t want him to be a Freddie Gray?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When Baltimore mom Toya Graham turned on the evening news, only to see her son on TV, throwing rocks at cops in the streets during Monday's riots, her instincts took over - her maternal instincts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I was shocked, I was angry, because you never want to see your child out there doing that," the feisty Graham told CBS News of the moment she spotted her son, Michael, 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>So Graham raced to the scene, smacked some sense into Michael and half-dragged/half-shamed him back home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The action, caught on video that has since gone viral, earned her praise on social media Tuesday as "Mom of the Year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He gave me eye contact. And at that point, you know, [I'm] not even thinking about cameras or anything like that. That's my only son," Graham further said of finding Michael as he was prepared for more mayhem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Graham said Michael knew he was in trouble the moment he spotted her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He knew he was in trouble," Graham told CBS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I'm a no-tolerant mother. Everybody that knows me, know I don't play that," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Michael, she added, is not immune to the lures of street life, and she has grounded him before to keep him off the mean streets of Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There's some days that I'll shield him in the house just so he won't go outside and I know that I can't do that for the rest of my life," she said in the brief interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Graham, meanwhile, became a social media sensation - with hundreds on Twitter hailing her under the hashtag "#momoftheyear."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Knock the HELL outta him to beat sense back into that skull! Hush with the "dont abuse ur kid" crap THATS A CARING MOM," JamSantwon wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I applaud her! She probably saved his life. She was probably very scared for him. You can't fault her for that," tweeted @LSergentanis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The video shows Graham angrily confronting her son - who was wearing all black - a hoodie and matching winter face mask covering most of his features - and she unleashed an expletive-filled torrent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"You want to be out here doing this dumb sh-t?" the furious mom screamed, repeatedly slapping the much taller youth on the side of his head with an open hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Take that f-ing mask off," she yelled as she connected with a series of rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Get the f-k over here. Get over here now, do you hear what I say?!" she said as she followed him to their car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In another video, the youth can be seen sulking off with his still-angry mom stalking along behind him as an onlooker gives a running commentary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"He was prepared for this sh-t. He got his all black on, got the gloves, face mask, and look who beside him, his mother! Goddamn!" the woman said, laughing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The pair watched news coverage of the riots when they got home, she told CBS, and she hoped he had learned his lesson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Michael, she added, was bombarded with messages on Facebook - praising his mom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Friends and everybody making comments and saying you know, you shouldn't be mad at your mother, you should give her a hug," said Graham.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>She was also concerned that he could have been hurt in a confrontation with the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"At the end of the day I don't want him to be a Freddie Gray," Graham said about the 25-year-old man who died after mysteriously sustaining severe spinal injuries in police custody, sparking the tumult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Even Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts sang her praises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"If you saw in one scene, you had a mother who grabbed their child who had a hood on his head and she started smacking him on the head because she was so embarrassed. I wish I had more parents who took charge of their kids tonight," Batts said.</td></tr>
