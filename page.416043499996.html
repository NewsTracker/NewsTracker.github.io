<h3>Ramirez, Pedroia 2 HRs each as Buchholz, Red Sox top Phils (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Maybe the Boston Red Sox had their ace all along.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Clay Buchholz threw three-hit ball over seven innings, Hanley Ramirez and Dustin Pedroia each hit two home runs and the Red Sox beat the Philadelphia Phillies 8-0 in an interleague opener Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Buchholz (1-0) gave the Red Sox reason to believe they might not need to trade for a No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>1 pitcher - namely Cole Hamels (0-1).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The right-hander struck out nine and pitched like the guy who went 12-1 in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''This is how I planned it in my head,'' Buchholz said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ramirez and Pedroia raved about their pitcher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''He was awesome,'' Pedroia said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''Best thing I saw was Buchholz,'' Ramirez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ramirez made quite an impression in his first game since the free agent signed an $88 million, four-year contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He hit a solo homer in the fifth and a grand slam off Jake Diekman in the ninth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''This is what I expect from the team, everybody hitting home runs and scoring a lot of runs,'' Ramirez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Hamels gave up five hits in five innings, striking out six.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He allowed four homers for the second time in his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mookie Betts also homered for Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Red Sox have been considered front-runners to land Hamels since the rebuilding Phillies made the 2008 World Series MVP available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But Boston isn't going to trade its best prospects for this version of Hamels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''It's discouraging,'' Hamels said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''You want to get the first win for your teammates and the organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Red Sox slugger David Ortiz kept both feet in the batter's box for nearly every pitch during his four at-bats, going 0 for 4 with three strikeouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ortiz made it clear in spring training he doesn't like baseball's new pace of play rules, but he adhered to them in his first game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The only time he stepped out was after fouling a ball off his foot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Ortiz left the clubhouse before reporters were allowed inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Plate umpire Gerry Davis said he had no issues with Big Papi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The revamped Red Sox spent $183 million on Ramirez and Pablo Sandoval, hoping their offense can lead them to another worst-to-first season like they had when they won the World Series in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Sandoval was 0 for 5 with two strikeouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Buchholz didn't allow a hit until Ryan Howard lined an 0-2 pitch for a double with two outs in the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Junichi Tazawa tossed a perfect eighth and Tommy Layne finished the three-hitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Pedroia hit a towering drive out to left-center in the first inning to give the Red Sox a 1-0 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Betts lined one out to left leading off the third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In the fifth, Pedroia connected again for his first multihomer game since Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>13, 2011, against Toronto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>One out later, Ramirez hit a deep drive to left-center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>''I'm back to who I am,'' said Pedroia, who had wrist surgery last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Pedroia snuffed Philadelphia's rally in the seventh inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>After consecutive one-hit hits, he made an excellent play at second base on Cody Asche's hard one-hopper and turned it into a fielder's choice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Buchholz then struck out Freddy Galvis to end the inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Red Sox: RHP Joe Kelly threw 78 pitches in five innings in an extended spring game in Florida.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Kelly has been slowed by a right biceps injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He's eligible to come off the disabled list on Saturday, but it's not certain whether he'll start this weekend at the New York Yankees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Knuckleballer Steven Wright would make the start if Kelly doesn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>After the game, the Red Sox and RHP Rick Porcello completed an $82.5 million, four-year contract that runs from 2016-19.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Following an off day on Tuesday, Porcello faces Phillies RHP Aaron Harang on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Porcello was 15-13 with a 3.43 ERA for Detroit last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Harang was 12-12 with a 3.57 ERA for Atlanta in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Ortiz got the start at first base over Mike Napoli because there's no designated hitter in NL parks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Ortiz hasn't played more than seven games at first since 2006 when he started 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Red Sox right fielder Shane Victorino played his first game against the Phillies since he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 31, 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>He received a standing ovation before his first at-bat.</td></tr>
