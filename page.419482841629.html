<tr><td>7</td><td>Trump was welcomed by an array of Alabama politicians, including Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, who praised him for the attention he's drawn to immigration issues.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>"My whole energy, my whole being" would go to making the U.S. rich and "great again", the Republican contender said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His business, he said, would be fine in the hands of his kids.</td></tr>

<tr><td>16</td><td>Before Trump arrived, his fans - some carrying signs, others wearing T-shirts supporting the billionaire businessman - spoke of his outsider status in a crowded field dominated by former and current elected officials as the song Sweet Home Alabama blared from loudspeakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Donald Trump is telling the truth and people don't always like that," said Donald Kidd, a 73-year-old retired pipe welder from Mobile.</td></tr>
