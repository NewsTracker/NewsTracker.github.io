<tr><td>91</td><td>He said "without these hard conditions, it would not have been responsible to launch such a large financial aid package."</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>Greeks seem to be taking the agreement their government reached with its creditors and its accompanying harsh measures in stride.</td></tr>

<tr><td>104</td><td>He says Greece hadn't been looking for "welfare" from other European countries, but for a program that would help its economy grow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras says the country's new bailout program should persuade markets that a Greek exit from the euro "is an issue of the past."</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>That, he said, would lead to investments returning to Greece and balancing out the recessionary measures that the deal includes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>Tsipras says, "The decision today keeps Greece in conditions of financial stability, it gives the possibility of recovery. At the same time though, we knew from before, that it would be an agreement whose implementation is difficult."</td></tr>

<tr><td>114</td><td>He says Greece managed to resist a request that Greece transfer public assets abroad as well as a "plan of financial suffocation and the collapse of the banking system."</td></tr>
