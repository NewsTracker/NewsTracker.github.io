<h3>Afghan police official fired for mob-killing Facebook comment</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hundreds of demonstrators marched in the capital on Tuesday for a second day to denounce police for allowing a crowd to beat the woman to death with planks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The woman, named Farkhunda, was killed and set on fire last week in front of police officers after she was accused of burning a Koran, Islam's holy book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Her death has triggered a public outcry in a country where mass demonstrations of support for women's rights are rare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Protesters in Kabul painted their faces red on Tuesday to represent Farkhunda's bloodied face as filmed by mobile phones as she was beaten to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We have come here to register a very deep sense of anger and frustration with the process of reform," said Afghanistan's former spy chief, Amrullah Saleh, who was at the protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Interior Minister Noor ul-Haq Olomi said on Tuesday that 20 officers, including the police chief of the district, had been dismissed over the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It is clear there was a failure to carry out police duties," Olomi said in a statement, promising a full investigation and prosecutions if warranted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hashmat Stanekzai, the spokesman for Kabul's police chief, was also fired on Tuesday for statements made on his personal Facebook page the day after the killing, Olomi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Stanekzai called the woman an "unbeliever" and said people like her hoped to gain U.S. or European citizenship with shows of blasphemy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Foreign aid donors have spent billions of dollars on Afghanistan's police force and trying to entrench the rule of law and many are frustrated at a persistent culture of impunity and abuse among the security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The country's top investigator has said there is no evidence Farkhunda burned the Koran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Her brother says a cleric made the accusation at his mosque after Farkhunda told a woman not to pay for good-luck amulets because they were un-Islamic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The president has ordered an inquiry into her killing and Olomi said 28 people have been arrested for participating in the mob attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>More than a dozen years after the fall of the hard-line Taliban regime that routinely executed people for violating their interpretation of Islamic law, Afghanistan remains a deeply conservative nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some Afghans - including a mullah in Kabul - expressed approval for last week's killing.</td></tr>
