<h3>Analysis: Egypt embarks on ambitious anti-terror campaign</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt is making an ambitious bid to place itself at the center of the fight against extremism across the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Beyond fighting militants in its own Sinai Peninsula, it is trying to organize an international coalition against the Islamic State in Libya and helping Saudi Arabia defend its borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - Egypt is making an ambitious bid to place itself at the center of the fight against extremism across the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The growing military alliance is rooted in a shared belief among Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Gulf Arab leaders that extremism must be confronted region-wide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It has been anchored with a quid pro quo: Gulf oil powerhouses Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have given Egypt an estimated $30 billion to rescue its damaged economy in return for Egypt providing military manpower alongside its Gulf counterparts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>With the alliance, this nation of 90 million people seeks to maneuver itself into a leadership role that has eluded it in recent years, first because of waning influence under former President Hosni Mubarak, then because of the turmoil that followed his 2011 ouster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A contingent of Egyptian troops is already deployed on Saudi Arabia's border with Iraq to help defend it against jihadi fighters, who earlier this year carried out a deadly cross-border raid, according to Egyptian military and security officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On another front, Gulf nations have said they are considering what action to take in Yemen, where Shiite rebels known as Houthis - widely suspected of links to Iran - have taken power in the capital and are fighting to seize more of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Egypt already has military advisers on the Saudi-Yemeni border tasked mainly with developing a joint strategy with the Saudis to confront future hostilities, according to the officials, who have first-hand knowledge of Egypt's plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the deployments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Plans for the creation of a military alliance with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and possibly Jordan were back on track after a period of hiatus, said the officials, with France, Italy and Algeria now viewed as possible additional partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Already, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates are bankrolling multibillion dollar arms purchases by Egypt, including jet fighters and naval pieces from both France and Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A deal with Germany to buy two submarines is under discussion, said the officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Separately, Egypt is trying to persuade the West to open up a new front against the Islamic State group in Libya, Egypt's western neighbor, and is appealing for "political and material" support to enable it to contain the threat in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Tuesday, El-Sissi called on the United Nations to approve a new coalition for airstrikes in Libya, where the extremists have set up their first major affiliate outside of Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He argued in a radio interview that the Islamic State group in Libya is not just a threat to Egypt - its militants beheaded a group of Egyptian Christians in a video released this week - but to Europe as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I want to say humanity will judge us if we do not fight against terrorism and protect humanity," el-Sissi told France's Europe 1 radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>France and Italy, directly across the Mediterranean from Libya, have come out in favor of some form of international action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The U.N. Security Council holds an emergency session Wednesday on the Libya crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The more assertive Egyptian-Gulf campaign, however, threatens to mire Egypt in multiple fights that could further enflame the ongoing conflicts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Egypt's military has been battling ferociously in Sinai, but has been unable to suppress jihadis who have sworn allegiance to the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They are believed to number in the hundreds or low thousands, bristling with heavy weapons smuggled in from Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Striking militants in Libya could prompt an even more brutal response from Sinai extremists, who previously have carried out high-profile bombings in Cairo and other Egyptian cities.</td></tr>
