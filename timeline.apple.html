<li>Apple wants to roll out the service in time for the new fall shows in September.</li>
<li>Apple's cachet and legions of loyal fans could make it one of the biggest threats yet to cable and satellite operators.</li>
<li>Apple last week unveiled its deal to offer HBO Now, a $14.99-a-month Internet streaming service on Apple devices beginning next month.</li>
<li>Any new subscription service ultimately would be designed to spur sales of the company's Apple TV device, which some consumers could use to replace their cable box.</li>
<li>Last week, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook slashed the price of the device to $69 from $99.</li>
<li>It was unclear Tuesday exactly which TV networks would be included in the proposed Apple service.</li>
<li>The current Apple TV device is capable of streaming dozens of channels, but the recent price cut for the box has stoked speculation that a new version could debut later this year.</li>
