<li>(AP) - In a quest to be more green, Apple says it is investing in Chinese solar power and preserving forests that make environmentally friendly paper.</li>
<li>It's also promising to use more renewable power overseas, where Apple relies heavily on contract manufacturers - and where a top executive acknowledged the company can do more.</li>
<li>The new solar project in China has a capacity of 40 megawatts, which is smaller than some projects Apple has announced in the United States.</li>
<li>By comparison, Apple is spending $850 million for rights to nearly half the output of a 280-megawatt solar facility planned for construction south of Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters.</li>
<li>That project will produce enough energy to power all of Apple's California offices, a computer center and 52 retail stores.</li>
<li>Still, the Chinese project will produce more than the amount of energy consumed by Apple's 19 corporate offices and 21 retail stores in China and Hong Kong, Jackson said.</li>

<li>Slow apps, low battery life limit appeal of Apple Watch: reviewers</li>
<li>(Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) "beautiful" and "stylish" smartwatch could make life easier for people on the move, reviewers say, but the gadget gets poor marks for battery life and slow-loading apps.</li>
<li>Reviews published on Wednesday made much of the device's relatively poor battery life - up to 18 hours, according to Apple - and said its apps will need upgrades to load more quickly.</li>
<li>Loading an app required the watch to pull tremendous amounts of data from iPhones, Patel said, adding that Apple had told him upcoming software updates would address performance issues.</li>
<li>Analysts at Societe Generale said they expected Apple to sell 8 million watches in 2015, contributing about 1.7 percent or $4 billion to Apple's total sales.</li>

<li>Apple Pay allows consumers using new Apple phones, tablets and smartwatches to buy goods by simply holding the device up to readers installed by store merchants.</li>
