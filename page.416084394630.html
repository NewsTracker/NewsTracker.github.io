<h3>Russia given 3-0 win over Montenegro in Euro 2016 qualifier</h3>

<tr><td>7</td><td>Play resumed after a 30-minute delay, and Akinfeev was taken to a hospital for treatment to neck and burns injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The game was called off at 0-0 after 67 minutes when Russian player Dmitry Kombarov was hit by an object thrown from the stands.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>Two Euro 2016 qualifiers have now been abandoned in Balkan countries and results decided by default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Last year, Serbia vs. Albania was stopped after a drone carrying a political banner was flown into the stadium.</td></tr>
