<h3>Greek PM says agreement is 'in sight'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has said agreement on his country's debt crisis is in sight after late-night talks in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said Greece would make a payment due to the IMF tomorrow, but the government still rejects benefit cuts and tax rises its creditors want before fresh loans are released to avert a bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker hosted Mr Tsipras for a late dinner at the EU executive's headquarters along with the chair of eurozone finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Creditors have signalled a will to compromise, notably by lowering how much surplus they want a new budget to generate to service Athens debts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But as Mr Tsipras's party battles to retain support from voters who elected in January to end years of austerity, its spokesman in parliament renewed tough rhetoric at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nikos Filis told a Greek broadcaster the government would not sign any "ultimatum" and would rather hold a new election if forced into a corner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Tsipras is balancing a hardline faction in his party that is keen to spend Greece back towards economic growth with impatient lenders in the rest of the eurozone and the wish of a large majority of Greeks not to be forced to give up the EU currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hours after Mr Filis warned that Greece might not repay the 300m in International Monetary Fund loans that fall due tomorrow if a deal was not at hand, Mr Tsipras gave assurances in Brussels that Athens would continue to honour its commitments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Don't worry about it," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We have already paid 7.5bn, so we will continue."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Of the negotiations, he reprised the positive tone he has taken since he secured a four-month extension of a bailout package in February: "I believe an agreement is in sight," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"But we need to conclude the discussions with a realistic point of view," he added, making clear his reservations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Referring to what negotiators say have been reductions in the targets creditors are setting for Greece's primary budget surplus - what it has left from other expenses to fund its debts - Mr Tsipras said: "We are very close to an agreement on the primary surplus. That means all sides agree to go further without tough austerity measures of the past."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But he also again ruled out scrapping a particular benefit for low-income pensioners or a value-added tax change that he said would raise the tax on electricity by ten percentage points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>This week has seen the creditors sketch out a possible compromise and the government draft its own proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"At the end of the day," Mr Tsipras said, "I think the proposals on the table will be the proposals of the Greek government."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Juncker has been active in trying to broker a deal and has ruled out Greece exiting the euro, an outcome many EU officials fear would undermine the long-term stability of the project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Juncker's office issued only this short statement: "It was a good, constructive meeting. Progress was made in understanding each other's positions on the basis of various proposals. It was agreed that they will meet again. Intense work will continue."</td></tr>
