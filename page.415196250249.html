<tr><td>3</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday his speech to the U.S. Congress offered a "practical alternative" to a possible Iranian nuclear deal, while opinion polls showed his party received a slight bump following his address ahead of the country's March 17 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>U.S. President Barack Obama said the Israeli leader had offered no viable alternative to preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons, saying "there was nothing new" in Netanyahu's speech Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a statement released after he landed in Israel, Netanyahu said the alternative deal he presented in Congress would make it harder for Iran to build a nuclear bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I proposed a practical alternative that through tougher restrictions would extend the breakout time, by years, that it would take Iran to reach a nuclear weapon if it decides to breach the agreement," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said his proposal also would maintain restrictions until Tehran stops "its sponsorship of terrorism around the world, its aggression against its neighbors and its calls for Israel's destruction."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said he received "very encouraging" responses from Democrats and Republicans to his speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Netanyahu's contentious speech to Congress took place despite objections from the White House, aggravating his already-strained relations with Obama.</td></tr>
