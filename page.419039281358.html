<h3>Mariota collides with scout during Titans' night practice (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NASHVILLE, Tenn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Marcus Mariota gave the Tennessee Titans a momentary scare Monday night when he scrambled and ran to the sideline where he crashed into a scout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mariota popped right back up and headed to the sideline after hitting the scout who worked hardest to convince the Titans to draft the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mariota gave Marv Sunderland a hand to help him back up before running to the huddle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Coach Ken Whisenhunt said Sunderland, who scouts the West for the Titans, was Mariota's biggest proponent this offseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''And then Marv's going to knock him out on the sideline?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Thanks a lot, Marv,'' Whisenhunt joked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>2 draft pick overall out of Oregon finished the practice completing 11 of 15 passes in team and seven-on-seven drills combined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He is the only one of four Titans quarterbacks who has yet to be intercepted even once through four practices of training camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But seeing Mariota go down worried not only fans but the Titans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This franchise started three different quarterbacks last season because of injuries in a 2-14 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''Marc, I mean he's a tough guy,'' tight end Delanie Walker said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''When I (saw) it, I was shocked at first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But again like I said, he's a tough guy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I wasn't too worried about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He (jumped) right up and went to the huddle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Notes: OT Byron Stingily (illness), S Cody Prewitt (bruised foot) and RB Antonio Andrews (foot) did not practice Monday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>With a day off Tuesday, Whisenhunt said he expects all three back Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>... The Titans also had their first scraps of camp with three different fights, and safety Daimion Stafford was involved in two.</td></tr>
