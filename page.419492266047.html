<h3>Donald Trump rallies large crowd in Alabama</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Republican front-runner Donald Trump on Friday joked, "I know how Billy Graham felt" as he addressed the largest crowd yet of his thriving presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I would like to have the election tomorrow," Trump crowed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I don't want to wait."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Thousands of Alabama voters came out to hear the New Yorker bring his message to the Deep South.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 40,000-seat Ladd-Peebles Stadium was about half-full when Trump began his speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Trump was welcomed by an array of Alabama politicians, including Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, who praised him for the attention he's drawn to immigration issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And Trump led off his speech with more criticism of immigrants living in the country illegally, drawing loud cheers when he repeated his promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He reiterated his intention to end "birthright citizenship" for children of immigrants here illegally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Trump also attacked the Obama administration's deal with Iran to restrict that country's nuclear program, calling it "so sad."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And he promised to "repeal and replace Obamacare" - the health care law that's President Barack Obama's singular domestic achievement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Before Trump arrived, his fans - some carrying signs, others wearing T-shirts supporting the billionaire businessman - spoke of his outsider status in a crowded field dominated by former and current elected officials as the song "Sweet Home Alabama" blared from loudspeakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Donald Trump is telling the truth and people don't always like that," said Donald Kidd, a 73-year-old retired pipe welder from Mobile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"He is like George Wallace, he told the truth. It is the same thing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Wallace, a fierce opponent of civil rights, served as governor of Alabama and sought the presidency multiple times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Kidd said Trump is a "breath of fresh air," and praised him as a businessman with common sense.</td></tr>
