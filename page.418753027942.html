<h3>2018 World Cup host Russia: FIFA crisis being disruptive</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko says the corruption crisis engulfing FIFA has thwarted communication with the embattled governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sepp Blatter will have left FIFA by the time of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, with the 79-year-old Swiss set to vacate the presidency in seven months after almost 18 years in power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blatter was accompanied by Mutko as he arrived at his St. Petersburg hotel for the World Cup qualifying draw on his first foreign trip since the FIFA scandal erupted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mutko says "communication with FIFA ... is not as easy as it was before because if you expect that there will be a change in administration in February then communication is somewhat thwarted."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mutko is also a member of FIFA's executive committee.</td></tr>
