<h3>Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists trade accusations as Minsk deal frays</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KIEV/MOSCOW, April 25 (Reuters) - The Ukrainian military and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine traded accusations on Saturday, reviving concerns that a peace deal signed in Minsk in February may collapse, although monitors said the violations were still relatively limited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One Ukrainian serviceman was killed and two were wounded when separatists shelled Ukraine's National Guard on Saturday at Shyrokyne, a village east of the port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov in Ukraine's southeast, Kiev's military said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Today at 0625 hours, the adversary used 122 mm artillery. They are banned under the Minsk agreements," spokesman Dmytro Gorbunov told the television channel 112.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The commander of the battalion that came under fire was separately quoted as saying the serviceman had been killed when a medical vehicle taking him to hospital was fired on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine also stepped up accusations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Today a rather explosive situation has formed, which demands the urgent intervention of the international community," rebel spokesman Eduard Basurin said, according to the Donetsk News Agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Basurin said Ukrainian forces had fired on an aid convoy from Russia, killing one person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He later accused them of increasingly frequent attacks and indiscriminate fire on populated areas, Interfax reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gleb Kornilov, head of the Foundation for Aid to Novorossiya, a Russian aid organisation, told Reuters that an aid column had come under fire from Ukrainian troops near Shyrokyne on Thursday when it accidentally strayed from an agreed route, and that a Russian citizen had been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The convoy didn't try to hide," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was in broad daylight, with flashing lights, with our stickers on all sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which is monitoring the ceasefire, said the violations were still limited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We are not in a phase of very active conflict like we have seen in previous months," OSCE Secretary-General Lamberto Zannier told Reuters on the sidelines of a security conference in Estonia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Another rebel representative, Denis Pushilin, said a fresh build-up of military hardware by Kiev in showed that it was intent on a "military solution of the conflict", according to the Russian news agency RIA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said the rebels were not opposed to the deployment of international peacekeepers in eastern Ukraine - a long-standing demand by Kiev - but accused Ukraine of violating the Minsk deal by failing to discuss constitutional changes with the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Attending military exercises in southwestern Ukraine, President Petro Poroshenko said: "Ukraine is strictly implementing the Minsk agreements, therefore the Ukrainian armed forces will never attack first."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Large quantities of heavy weapons with a calibre of more than 100 mm have been withdrawn by both sides under the Minsk deal, brokered by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Yet both sides regularly accuse each other of violating the accord.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Kiev military says rebels are keeping up pressure on the Mariupol, strategically important not least for its position between rebel-controlled eastern regions and the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in March 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>More than 6,100 people have been killed in the conflict, which erupted in the Russian-speaking east after Russia seized Crimea following the overthrow of a Moscow-backed president in Kiev.</td></tr>
