<tr><td>14</td><td>He said Laabidi had been flagged to the intelligence agency, although not for "anything special."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The attack was the worst at a tourist site in Tunisia in more than a decade and prompted a leading Italian cruise ship line to announce it was canceling all stops in the North African nation indefinitely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The deaths of so many tourists will create massive trouble for Tunisia's tourism industry, which attracts thousands of foreigners every year to the country's Mediterranean beaches, desert oases and ancient Roman ruins - and which had just started to recover after years of decline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Two major cruise ships whose passengers were among the victims quickly left the port of Tunis early Thursday, leaving behind grieving family members and slain passengers.</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>Tunisia has faced scattered attacks by extremists for the past several years, though nothing on this scale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>None of the country's main militant groups had previously pledged allegiance to Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Geoff Porter, a North Africa security analyst, said it was likely the IS group had perhaps inspired the operation but not actually planned it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I think it's probably taking credit for something it may not have played a role in," he told the AP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>According to survivors and witnesses, two or more gunmen attacked the museum wielding assault rifles and began gunning down tourists in front of a row of about 10 buses.</td></tr>

<tr><td>38</td><td>A Spanish man and a pregnant Spanish woman who survived hid in the museum all night in fear.</td></tr>
