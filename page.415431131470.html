<h3>Ukraine's grinding war stains innocence of childhood</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Like many 7-year-olds in eastern Ukraine, he has trouble recalling a time before the war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"They've always been shooting," he says, vigorously scratching with the brightest of pencils.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yelena Nikulenko, the director of the children's home in the rebel-held town of Khartsyzk, says kids like Seryozha have been let down twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>First orphaned or abandoned by their parents, they were then dumped by their new families when the Ukrainian government stopped paying benefits to foster families in separatist-controlled areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"On top of that, you have the war, the shelling, the fear," Nikulenko says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It will be a scar for the rest of their lives, that's for sure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The conflict that erupted in Ukraine last year between government troops and Russian-backed separatists has claimed at least 6,000 lives and displaced nearly 1.8 million people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The United Nations Children's Fund estimates that 1.7 million children on both sides of the front line have been harmed through lack of proper shelter, nutrition, medicine or schooling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Children struggle to understand what is going on around them, and why.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fighting has abated drastically since a new cease-fire came into effect last month, but the suffering, loneliness and terror remain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the government-held town of Popasna, 70 kilometers (45 miles) north of the children's home, only a few people walk along deserted streets between apartments gutted by rocket fire, a grim contrast to the days when the town bustled with 30,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>One of those destroyed homes belongs to Tatyana Belash, who has now taken shelter in a basement with her 3-year old daughter, Zlata.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As the adults talk politics, Zlata, a shy girl with blonde pigtails, darts around the basement cluttered with battered mattresses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Asked about the shelling, Zlata shies away and seeks comfort in stroking her cat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"When we first came here, she kept saying: 'Let's go home! "</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Belash says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I couldn't explain to her that we couldn't go home because there was fighting going on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Children in the Ukraine-controlled village of Chermalyk play war and scuttle in and out of the craters made by falling Grad rockets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>As 11-year old Tolik Tokar shimmies into one crater, his head disappears from view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Then he raises his head and pretends to shoot at the baddies: the separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The boys take aim with make-believe guns fashioned from sticks - but Tokar has seen shooting first-hand, not just in play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"When shelling was raging, we went to check it out, and then they opened fire on me," Tokar says, stammering as he tells his tale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The bullets tore through the cloth on my shoulder here and flew past."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A few dozen kilometers away on the rebel side, children play the same games - but with roles reversed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>There, Ukrainian soldiers are the bogeymen, with "Nazi" one of the favorite slurs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The 22 children under Nikulenko's tutelage, in Khartsyzk, are some of the most vulnerable anywhere in the war-wracked region, and she asks that they be identified only by their first names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Before fighting began, the home served as a shelter for children rescued from the streets, or seeking respite from dysfunctional families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>More have been abandoned in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Veronika, a freckled and gap-toothed 6-year-old, smiles and pulls down on her red-checked dress as she recalls life before the war - the visits to the amusement park and zoo, her mother's home cooking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>She even has fond memories of her father, who returned home after a stint in prison for slashing her mother's shoulder with a knife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Since then, her father enlisted with the rebel army and her mother left her at the children's home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Veronika relies on her own inner strength to ward off the terror brought on by war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"When they were doing boom-boom, it was so scary," she says, recalling a recent bout of shelling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Once when they were shooting at night, I fell off the bed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Veronika's mother visits Khartsyzk from time to time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The young girl hopes to go home when summer comes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Nikulenko says children in her care have come under the spell of Russian television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>They love watching programs that cast the rebels as valiant heroes of a popular uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Ukrainian government troops are treated as vicious occupiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"It's very dangerous, this black-and-white perception," Nikulenko says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"These children get information only from one side. They see that (government troops) shoot at us and that their fathers and brothers take arms and go to protect us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>As a group of girls huddles on a carpet in the games room, Yulya, a tall and unsmiling 12-year old, stands to one side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Before the war began, Yulya lived with her grandparents in Rusko-Orlivka, a village that changed hands several times as fighting raged last summer for the nearby town of Ilovaysk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Yulya's grandfather told her that when the rebel fighters captured Rusko-Orlivka, fighters found nine Ukrainian soldiers hiding out in a farm, marched them out to a forest and shot them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Yulya says she felt little pity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"I understand they are people too, but they kill other people," she says in a whisper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"I know that, because my grandfather told me so."</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>For the very young, little is truly understood about who is fighting or why.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Drawing his tank in the children's home, Seryozha, in a moment of confusion, gets it into his head to decorate it with a blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"It was born in Ukraine. I was born in Ukraine, too," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Above the Ukrainian flag that sticks out from the side, he then draws the black, blue and red flag of the separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Seryozha's own past is a blur even to those around him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>A scar on his back shows where he was shot with an air-powered pistol before the war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Nobody quite knows what happened, beyond that his parents died of tuberculosis, leaving his sister and two brothers orphaned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>A bureaucratic oversight separated Seryozha from his siblings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>As they were evacuated by Ukrainian authorities to a neighboring region, nobody remembered that Seryozha was lying in a hospital recovering from tuberculosis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>He landed in the Khartsyzk home in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Children may have a hazy understanding of the events around them, but forgiveness appears to come more easily than to the adults.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Could Seryozha ever be friends with children from the other side?</td></tr>

<h3>IRS warns of tax scams involving health care law</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Unscrupulous tax preparers are using President Barack Obama's health care law as a ploy to pocket bogus fines from unsuspecting taxpayers, including some immigrants not bound by the law's requirements, the IRS warned Friday, March 13, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Unscrupulous tax preparers are using President Barack Obama's health care law as a ploy to pocket bogus fines from unsuspecting taxpayers, including some immigrants not bound by the law's requirements, the IRS warned Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In an advisory, the tax agency said consumers can be sure something is wrong when a tax preparer says they collect the health law fines that may be due the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The law requires virtually everybody in the country to have coverage or risk fines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The payment should never be made directly to an individual or return preparer," the IRS said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Most people don't owe the (fine) at all because they have health coverage or qualify for a coverage exemption."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sometimes the con artists promise to lower the purported fine if the consumer pays them directly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The IRS said it has received reports from around the country that fraudsters are targeting immigrants, particularly Spanish speakers with a limited understanding of English.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In some cases, people who don't owe a fine because they have Medicaid or some other form of health insurance have been told they need to pay anyway, because supposedly they don't have the right kind of coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In other cases, immigrants who are not bound by the law's coverage requirements are being told they must pay a fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Young immigrants protected from deportation by the Obama administration fall into a legal gray area that may be prime territory for exploitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While they do have authorization to work and therefore pay taxes, they are not considered "lawfully present" for purposes of the health care law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They are not entitled to coverage under the law, and the mandate to get coverage does not apply to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The health care law uses the income tax system to subsidize coverage and also to collect fines from people who remain uninsured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>This is the first tax-filing season that the connections between health insurance and income taxes are becoming visible to average consumers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Two of the most complicated areas for consumers - taxes and health care - are now intertwined.</td></tr>
