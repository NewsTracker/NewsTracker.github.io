<h3>Apple co-operation with antitrust monitor down 'sharply': report</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Michael Bromwich, who became Apple's monitor after it was found liable for conspiring to raise e-book prices, said in a report on Thursday that Apple objected to providing information and "inappropriately" attempted to limit his activities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bromwich, whose relationship with Apple has been testy since the start, had indicated that relations had improved in a report in October to U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, he said in his latest report that the company recently had taken a more "adversarial tone" in discussions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We have conducted no interviews since January, and Apple has rejected our recent requests for interviews," Bromwich wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Despite those difficulties, Bromwich said he had interviewed Apple's entire board and executive team, and Apple had made progress in developing a "comprehensive and effective" compliance program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Representatives for Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Bromwich, a former U.S. Justice Department inspector general, was appointed by Cote in October 2013 after she found the company liable in the civil antitrust case brought by the Justice Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cote ruled that Apple played a "central role" in scheming from late 2009 into early 2010 with five publishers to raise e-book prices and impede competitors such as Amazon.com Inc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The publishers include Lagardere SCA's Hachette Book Group Inc, News Corp's HarperCollins Publishers LLC, Penguin Group Inc, CBS Corp's Simon & Schuster Inc and Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH's Macmillan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Apple has appealed, arguing it engaged in pro-competitive conduct when it entered an e-books market in 2010 dominated by Amazon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>During arguments in December, a three-judge panel appeared sympathetic to Apple's arguments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If Apple wins the appeal, it could jeopardize a related US$450 million settlement among Apple, 33 attorneys general, and lawyers for a class of consumers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A separate appeal by Apple seeking to disqualify Bromwich was heard in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Apple said Bromwich has been overly aggressive in seeking interviews with executives and engaging in private discussions with the Justice Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Apple has also objected to Bromwich's fees, initially $1,100 an hour before being reduced to an undisclosed amount.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The case is U.S. v.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No.</td></tr>
