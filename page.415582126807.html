<h3>FIFA says 2022 World Cup final in Qatar will be on Dec. 18</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A 2010 model of what Qatar proposes for a main stadium as a part of the 2022 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ZURICH (AP) - The final match of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be played on Dec. 18, the country's national holiday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>FIFA spokesman Walter De Gregorio confirmed the date Thursday, but did not say when the tournament would start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The governing body's executive committee prefers a 28-day tournament - starting Nov. 21 - but did not make a decision in the opening session of its two-day meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>De Gregorio said the executive committee could confirm the kickoff date on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It is a major step because finally we know and we can move forward," De Gregorio said in a hastily arranged statement at FIFA headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The November-December option was expected after being recommended by a FIFA-appointed task force which met last month in Doha, Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The task force sought to take FIFA's lucrative event out of the Qatari summer heat in the June-July period when World Cups are traditionally played.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>FIFA President Sepp Blatter then said he preferred a Sunday, Dec. 18, final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Every World Cup final since 1966 has been played on a Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>By rejecting UEFA's preferred Dec. 23 final, a Friday, the FIFA executive committee helped protect the English Premier League's traditional Dec. 26 program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A 28-day World Cup, four days fewer than usual, would cut the time clubs must release players to national teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>European clubs and leagues, which must shut down for several weeks in the middle of their seasons, have been the strongest opponents of an end-of-year tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Qatar bid to stage the tournament in June-July when it was chosen as host in December 2010.</td></tr>
