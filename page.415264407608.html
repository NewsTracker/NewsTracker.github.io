<h3>Ex-Cabinet official Donna Shalala to lead Clinton Foundation</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Former President Bill Clinton said Friday that he had chosen Shalala, the outgoing president of the University of Miami, to serve as the next president and chief executive officer of the sprawling philanthropy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He announced his choice during a weekend meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative University in Coral Gables, Florida.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I don't know in my long life that I ever worked with anybody who had quite the combination of policy knowledge and concern, political skills, a personal touch with people, a sense of innate fairness," the former president said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"She's a remarkable person."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton said he would recommend Shalala's appointment to the foundation's board and that she had the full support of the Clinton family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Shalala served as secretary of Health and Human Services under Bill Clinton for eight years and became the university's president in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A prodigious fundraiser, she has raised nearly $3 billion during her 14-year tenure and is expected to begin leading the foundation in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Her selection was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Shalala's installation will give the couple another longtime ally serving in a key role as Mrs. Clinton builds her campaign organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>John Podesta, a former White House chief of staff under Bill Clinton, is expected to serve in a senior role for the 2016 campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Shalala has remained a close friend of the couple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She served for 15 years along with Hillary Clinton on the board of the Children's Defense Fund and was the longest-serving HHS secretary under Bill Clinton.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>She defended Bill Clinton when he was accused of having an affair with a White House intern but later confronted him about it during a Cabinet meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Everyone was being a bit of an apologist for him in the room and I just blew up," Shalala said in an oral history on Clinton's presidency for The Miller Center at the University of Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The foundation, created by the former president in 2001, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to combat AIDS in Africa, raise educational standards around the globe and fight poverty.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>The foundation's previous CEO, Eric Braverman, announced his departure in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It has been run on an interim basis by Maura Pally, a longtime aide to the Clintons.</td></tr>

<h3>Jakarta execution delay encouraging</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Bali Nine pair were on Wednesday moved from their Bali jail for execution on Central Java's Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Their wait for execution was expected to be so brief - a required minimum 72 hours - that they were allowed to take only a plastic bag each containing clothes and a bible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Now they could be there for days or weeks, as Indonesian authorities wait for several prisoners' legal options to run their course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo can't confirm when the executions will take place or how many prisoners will meet the firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Foreign minister Julie Bishop has welcomed the news, saying she is hopeful "in my heart" that the development might reflect a change of mind by Indonesian authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran, Todung Mulya Lubis, also welcomed the news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I'm pleased to hear it, so let's wait for the legal processes, that's how it should be," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Lubis has challenged the clemency rejection for Chan and Sukumaran, arguing President Joko Widodo didn't follow due process when he didn't assess their circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The administrative court threw out the challenge and he's now appealing, with a date set for the same Jakarta court for Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The lawyers are also pursuing a complaint in the judicial commission after a former lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran alleged interference in the first trial that ended with them sentenced to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran provided a statement about the cash-for-leniency claim, but the ex-lawyer himself has yet to detail his recollections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The commission is considering the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Prasetyo's view of the ongoing legal processes has shifted considerably in the past week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Monday he told reporters: "If there's already clemency (rejected), there should be no more other legal challenges submitted."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Friday his spokesman said: "We want to respect the ongoing legal process."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It remains an anxious time for Chan and Sukumaran's Sydney families, who remain in Cilacap, the departure point for Nusakambangan, and have yet to see the men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Their Melbourne barrister Julian McMahon, Australia's consul-general Majell Hind and other lawyers visited the men on Saturday, but families must wait until regular visiting hours on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>- Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso (Philippines) has applied for a second judicial review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>- Zainal Abidin (Indonesia) has been waiting years for the court's answer on his judicial review, according to his family.</td></tr>
