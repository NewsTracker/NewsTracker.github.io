<h3>Rowan Atkinson sells McLaren F1 he crashed twice</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Rowan Atkinson has made a bumper profit after selling the 8million supercar he famously crashed twice in one of the UK's biggest ever deals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The comic actor bought his beloved McLaren F1 in 1997 for around 540,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In 2011, after crashing into a hedge in Oxfordshire, his insurance company was handed a 910,000 repair bill in what is thought to be the biggest-ever single car insurance claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But while most cars would lose value when they are involved in a serious crash, the 240mph F1 is different and its price has continued to rise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Atkinson recently decided it was time to sell up after the F1 became "a thing of value".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He put it on the market for 8million with specialist car dealer Taylor and Crawley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>David Clark, boss of Taylor and Crawley and the man who originally sold Atkinson the F1, confirmed he has sold the car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said: "Everyone is very pleased with the sale. There was interest from around the world and it has gone to a British buyer who will drive it like Rowan did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It is one of the biggest ever deals in the UK. Rowan is pleased, but also maybe a bit sad as he did 40,000 miles in it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Clark, a former sales and marketing director at McLaren, would not reveal the price paid by the unknown Briton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But it is unlikely to be too far short of the 8million asking price because the F1 is regarded as the most collectable car of the past 45 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At 8million, it would rank it among the highest prices ever paid in the UK for a car, with only 1960s Ferraris tending to sell for more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The F1 is powered by a 6.1-litre V12 engine developing a 627bhp - a record for a non-super or turbocharged car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It will do 0-62mph in 3.2 seconds and accelerate all the way to 241mph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Clark previously said he was not sure anyone had enjoyed 41,000 miles in a McLaren F1 - "apart from a couple of miles where different things happened" - as much as Rowan Atkinson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Mr Bean star would use the F1 as his daily car and also took it on a number of tours for McLaren owners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And when Atkinson originally took delivery of the F1, he strapped his two young children into their child seats and took them on a five-hour drive to Cornwall for a holiday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Clark added that he is "one of the most enthusiastic car owners I have ever met, a real user of his cars and that is how he derives his enjoyment: from the using, not the having".</td></tr>
