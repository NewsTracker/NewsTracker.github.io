<tr><td>2</td><td>Deadline looms for Netanyahu to form governing coalition JERUSALEM (AP) - With the clock ticking, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raced to put together a governing coalition Tuesday or face the prospect of being forced out of office by a former ally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netanyahu's Likud Party won March 17 elections, emerging as the largest single party in parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But he has had a tough time striking deals with other parties to secure a 61-seat majority in the 120-seat parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If he fails by the end of the day Wednesday, President Reuven Rivlin must give someone else the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His efforts hit a snag Monday when a key ally, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, unexpectedly resigned and announced his secular nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party was joining the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>By late Tuesday, Netanyahu had deals with three partners controlling 53 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They include Kulanu, a centrist party focused on economic issues, and two ultra-Orthodox religious parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>With the deadline approaching, Netanyahu negotiated Tuesday with the hawkish Jewish Home Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The party, linked to the West Bank settler movement, is led by Naftali Bennett, a former Netanyahu aide who now has a rocky relationship with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bennett reportedly was driving a hard bargain, seeking the prestigious job of foreign minister for himself and the job of justice minister for a party member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Israeli media reported Bennett is fuming over Netanyahu's deals with the ultra-Orthodox parties giving them ministerial power over religious services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Even if they reach a deal, Netanyahu would have the slimmest of majorities, with just 61 seats, leaving him vulnerable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A narrow coalition would have a difficult time passing economic reforms favored by Kulanu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It also would be averse to peace moves with the Palestinians and likely favor expanded settlement construction, putting it on a collision course with the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Parliament speaker Yuli Edelstein of Likud warned on Israel's Channel 2 television station that such a government would not be effective or last long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He recommended that Netanyahu reach out to the dovish Zionist Union list to stabilize it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>However, its leader, Isaac Herzog, has said he will sit in the opposition.</td></tr>
