<h3>Islamic State militants behead archaeologist in Palmyra</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Islamic State militants beheaded an antiquities scholar in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra and hung his body on a column in a main square of the historic site, Syria's antiquities chief said on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Syrian state antiquities chief Maamoun Abdulkarim said the family of Khaled Asaad had informed him that the 82-year-old scholar who worked for over 50 years as head of antiquities in Palmyra was executed by Islamic State on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Asaad had been detained and interrogated for over a month by the ultra-radical Sunni Muslim militants, he told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>There are fears that Islamic State militants will destroy the Palmyra ruins in Syria, which UNESCO has designated a World Heritage site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Just imagine that such a scholar who gave such memorable services to the place and to history would be beheaded... and his corpse still hanging from one of the ancient columns in the centre of a square in Palmyra," Abdulkarim said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The continued presence of these criminals in this city is a curse and bad omen on (Palmyra) and every column and every archaeological piece in it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Abdulkarim said Asaad was known for several scholarly works published in international archaeological journals on Palmyra, which in antiquity flourished as an important trading hub along the Silk Road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He also worked over the past few decades with U.S., French, German and Swiss archeological missions on excavations and research in Palmyra's famed 2,000-year-old ruins, a UNESCO World Heritage Site including Roman tombs and the Temple of Bel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Before the city's capture by Islamic State, Syrian officials said they moved hundreds of ancient statues to safe locations out of concern they would be destroyed by the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In June, Islamic State did blow up two ancient shrines in Palmyra that were not part of its Roman-era structures but which the militants regarded as pagan and sacrilegious.</td></tr>
