<h3>Prince Harry to join Walking with the Wounded charity trek through the UK</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Today, the 30-year-old royal revealed that he will be taking part in an epic 1,000 mile trek through the UK as part of a fundraising drive for Walking With The Wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Speaking during the launch of Walk of Britain at London's Mandarin Oriental Hotel, the prince said he was 'delighted' to be taking part in the trek and is 'looking forward to it'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He also used his first public appearance since announcing he is leaving the Army to admit that he expects the transition into civilian life to be 'challenging'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'The public's support for our Armed Forces continues to be extraordinary,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'However, as the memory of our military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan fade, we must encourage people to continue supporting our servicemen and women; particularly those who are seeking to transition into civilian life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'This process can be challenging, as it is for anyone seeking a new career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Today's visit to the Mandarin Oriental comes just 48 hours after Kensington Palace announced that he is to retire from the Army after a 10-year career that included two tours of duty in Afghanistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Before he hangs up his boots, Harry will spend four weeks with the Australian Defence Force, splitting his time between Sydney, Darwin and Perth, and will continue on to New Zealand for an official tour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Much of the summer will be spend in Africa, where the Prince will occupy himself with charity work, much of it conservation focused, according to Kensington Palace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Returning to the UK in the autumn, Harry will then join the core team of five wounded veterans taking part in the Walk of Britain which gets underway on the 22nd August in Scotland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The epic trek, which, it is hoped, will result in wider public awareness of veterans' needs, will end in London on the 31st October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Harry is no stranger to the charity's lengthy expeditions, having previously taken part in walks to the North Pole in 2011 and another to the South Pole in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For the latter, the Prince was joined by a star-studded crew that included Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgard, as well of wounded veterans - some of whom were at the Mandarin Oriental for the launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Watched by an audience that included Walking With the Wounded co-founder Ed Perkins, Harry made an impassioned speech about the need to help veterans and outlined his hopes for the trek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'Walk of Britain will cover all parts of the country,' he explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'Walking through the communities in which our service personnel and veterans grew up and now live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>'In doing so, Walk of Britain will give everyone the opportunity to meet these remarkable men and women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>'People up and down the country will get to see first-hand the determination and resolve of those who have served, and in particular those who have been injured or suffer hidden wounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>'They will see that whatever their circumstances these men and women are looking to the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They are looking to employers to give them the chance to keep making a contribution to our communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>'These men and women want to continue to serve their country in whatever way possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>PTSD and mental injury can make life a daily struggle, but we should not assume that everyone leaving the military faces these challenges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>'It's also important to keep mental health issues in perspective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>We should remind people that nearly all cases end well, whether it be total cure, adjustment of life, or the ability for the individual to accept and admit the issues that face them, amongst a tricky culture of stigma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Harry's work with Walking With the Wounded echoes his previous efforts, most notably last year's hugely successful Invictus Games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Although the event will not take place this year, aides are keen to emphasise that Prince Harry's championing of wounded servicemen will continue post-retirement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He will also continue to take part in military events, beginning with a trip to Turkey next month to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Harry, who will be based in Australia when the event takes place, will fly to Turkey and will be joined by Prince Charles for a memorial service.</td></tr>

<h3>Nigerian military: No news of 219 kidnapped schoolgirls</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The admission of lack of progress on the missing schoolgirls comes as the Nigerian military, bolstered by forces from neighboring countries, is regaining towns and cities held by Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The military's successes come as Nigeria prepares for a critical presidential election on March 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Other kidnap victims have escaped and some have been freed by the militants, but there has been not a whisper about the girls whose mass abduction spawned the #BringBackOurGirls campaign and provoked protests around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"No news ?for now because in all the liberated areas we have, we have also made enquiries, but the truth is, when the terrorists are running away, they run also with their families," army chief Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minimah told reporters on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are optimistic that ... we will get further details on them" as Boko Haram's area of influence shrinks, Minimah said in Abuja, Nigeria's capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The military this week "liberated completely" the two northeastern states of Yobe and Adamawa from the extremists, said Minimah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said Boko Haram now holds only three of 27 local government areas in Borno, the third northeastern state under a military state of emergency and the birthplace of Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Monday, the military said it had recaptured Bama, the second city of Borno state, as it prepares a final assault against the extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The victories, after years of failure, follow an offensive launched at the end of January by troops from Chad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Despite the lack of news on the schoolgirls, Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan, currently campaigning for re-election in a tight race against former military dictator Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, has repeated promises to bring the girls back alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I am more hopeful now than before on the Chibok girls," Jonathan told a televised media chat on Feb. 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But unconfirmed reports indicate that many of the schoolgirls may have been forced into marriage with their captors, some carried across Nigeria's borders and at least three died early on from snakebites and untreated malaria and other ailments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However Jonathan says he remains optimistic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I believe that the story of the Chibok girls will be better, now that we are working with Niger, Cameroon and Chad," he said, referring to a new regional army of 8,750 troops to fight Boko Haram as the militants carry their conflict over Nigeria's borders in their bid to recreate an ancient Islamic caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>More than 1.5 million people driven from their homes by Boko Haram's nearly 6-year-old Islamic uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some 10,000 people were killed in the uprising just last year, according to the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some 276 girls were snatched before dawn from the government boarding school in Chibok on April 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Dozens escaped in the first couple of days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But 219 remain missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A spate of recent suicide bombings carried out by young women and girls has raised fears that Boko Haram is using kidnap victims to increase its deadly toll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In videos, Boko Haram's leader has said that girls should be married off, not educated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The group's nickname means "Western education is sinful."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In early February, Nigeria's air force began bombarding the Sambisa Forest, a stronghold of Boko Haram where the Chibok girls first were taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Last year, the military said it could not bomb the forest or launch a ground offensive for fear the girls would be harmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Are these girls going to be collateral damage? It is very, very sad," said Hussain Monguno, a community leader in the Borno-Yobe People's Forum told The Associated Press after the bombing started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"As the days go by, the possibility of getting them back becomes very bleak."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Restless nights have been the lot of the Rev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Enoch Mark, a pastor with the Church of the Brethren whose two daughters are among the kidnapped girls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He said he is in hiding because he has become a wanted man by Boko Haram because of his role as a spokesman for parents of the Chibok girls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"I have been spending the nights sleeplessly worrying about what condition my daughters might be in," Mark told AP by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"I am so disturbed, thinking of my daughters, thinking of the other Chibok girls."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Associated Press writers Bashir Adigun and Chika Oduah contributed to this report from Abuja, Nigeria.</td></tr>
