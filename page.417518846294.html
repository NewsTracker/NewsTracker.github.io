<h3>England could host World Cup in 2022 if Qatar is stripped of it over FIFA corruption scandal, says culture secretary</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>England is ready to host the 2022 World Cup if it is stripped from Qatar in the wake of allegations of corruption and bribery in FIFA, culture secretary John Whittingdale has said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr Whittingdale said the country has the facilities and mounted an impressive, if unsuccessful, bid to host the 2018 World Cup, and so could host the 2022 event if asked by FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He spoke as MPs asked whether England could step in to host the World Cup if allegations that the bid process for the Qatar tournament was corrupt are found to be true.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Whittingdale backed FA chairman Greg Dyke's observation that since the 2018 World Cup is being hosted by Russia, it may be unlikely that another European nation would be granted the 2022 edition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But he said England 'obviously' has the facilities to host the world's biggest football tournament, last held in the country in 1966.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>During culture questions in the Commons, Mr Whittingdale said: 'In terms of the decision to hold the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, that is obviously something which we are watching the investigation, but at the moment that decision stands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'If it were decided to change that, I think as the chairman of the English FA observed, if Russia hosts the World Cup in 2018 it does seem very unlikely that another European country would host it in 2022.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Downing Street said England 'already has outstanding football facilities' and indicated that the Prime Minister is set to raise the FIFA scandal at the G7 meeting of industrial nations later this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She added: 'The PM was very clear that he wanted to see Sepp Blatter go and to clean up the beautiful game and there is now the opportunity to do that and to clean up FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>FIFA whistleblower Chuck Blazer has admitted taking bribes to vote for both the 1998 and 2010 World Cups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The American also pleaded guilty to tax evasion and accepting bribes and kickbacks connected to five Gold Cups - the North and Central American confederation's flagship tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This damning admission of criminal activity on FIFA's executive was contained in Blazer's plea-bargain testimony given to the FBI in November 2013 but made public for the first time on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It came just 24 hours after the resignation of FIFA president Sepp Blatter amid criminal investigations in America and Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The 2018 World Cup in Russia has also come under threat as the FBI are now investigating how the country was awarded the tournament, along with Qatar in 2022.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Qatar had taken offence at FA chairman Greg Dyke suggesting they wouldn't be sleeping well in the wake of Blatter's resignation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Qatar FA president Sheik Hamad told Dyke he should let the legal process take its course and concentrate on delivering his promise to build an England team capable of winning the World Cup by then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Dyke responded: 'It's pathetic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They would say that, wouldn't they.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A year ago when The Sunday Times published that massive dossier about Qatar and the Qatar World Cup, the response from Blatter was that the British media was being racist because a lot of it involved corruption in Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>I take offence at that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>'There is an email out there from FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke saying the Qataris 'bought the World Cup'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They denied it, but it is out there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Now that the Swiss authorities are investigating the process, we must wait and see what happens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>'If in the end they say it was a fair process then, yes, it should go ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But Qatar's foreign minister Khaled Al Attiyah countered: 'No way can Qatar be stripped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>We are confident of the procedures and presented the best file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Part of Blazer's evidence is redacted, suggesting further evidence involving the FIFA hierarchy is being kept back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The 70-year-old, now seriously ill in a New York hospital with cancer and pneumonia, admits: 'During my association with FIFA and CONCACAF, among other things I and others agreed that I or a co-conspirator would commit at least two acts of racketeering activity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>'I agreed with others in or around 1992 to facilitate the acceptance of a bribe in conjunction with the selection of the host nation for the 1998 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>I and others on the FIFA executive committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Blazer's testimony shows that FIFA's fraudsters tainted World Cups long before the 2018 and 2022 editions, which are currently being probed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>While the Qatar decision has been the subject of huge controversy since the ballot in 2010, Russia, who will have world football gathering in St Petersburg for the qualifying draw on July 25, has largely escaped suspicion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>But an FBI official has told Reuters that the World Cup bids would be part of the probe that is now going beyond the alleged $100million ( 65m) worth of fraudulent activity by FIFA officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Russia 2018 World Cup chief Alex Sorokin said last week: 'We did everything the process wanted us to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>And a statement from their organising committee said: 'The 2018 World Cup will be held for the first time in the territory of the world's largest country.</td></tr>
