<h3>Jury reaches verdict on sentence for woman convicted of granddaughter's running death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- Jurors have reached a verdict on a sentence for an Alabama woman convicted of capital murder in her granddaughter's running death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Court officials were waiting for the verdict to be announced after jurors said they had reached a decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The decision came Thursday on the defendant Joyce Hardin Garrard's 50th birthday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The same jury convicted Garrard of capital murder last week in the February 2012 death of 9-year-old Savannah Hardin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prosecutors told jurors the woman deserved to die for making the girl run for hours as punishment for a lie about candy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The child collapsed and died later in a hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The defense asked for mercy, arguing that Savannah loved Garrard and wouldn't want her put to death.</td></tr>
