<h3>Mexico says arson at US company linked to extortion</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) " An arson attack on a subsidiary of a U.S. energy-services firm was part of an extortion attempt, prosecutors in southern Mexico said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The attorney general in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco, Fernando Valenzuela, said that five attackers forced their way into the company's yard and burned three trucks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Unfortunately, the motive was extortion," Valenzuela told the Radio Formula station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He confirmed local media accounts that the attackers said the arson was punishment for having ignored demands for protection payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Thousands of smaller Mexican companies have been subject to such extortion demands by criminal gangs, but larger, foreign-owned firms have seldom been acknowledged as targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However, repeated calls to the company's U.S. and Mexican offices went unanswered.</td></tr>
