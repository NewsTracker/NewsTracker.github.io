<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu tries to derail Barack Obama's hopes for Iran nuclear deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Israeli leader said his speech, which has infuriated the White House, was not meant to "disrespect" Mr Obama but that that the "survival" of his country was at stake if the Iran deal goes ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Twitter: Philip Crowther - Fascinating juxtaposition: at the same time #Netanyahu warns of a deal, @JohnKerry meets with #Iran Foreign Minister #Zarif in Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>His voice boomed from a vast stage decorated with Israeli and American flags as he declared the Jewish people would never again be "passive in the face of threats to annihilate us".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Netanyahu will speak in Congress even as Iranian and US negotiators continue to meet in Switzerland to hammer out the final details of an agreement that could be the first step in a historic realignment of America's approach to the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>While the negotiations could still collapse in their last stages, leaked details suggest the greatest hurdles have been cleared and the two sides are closing in on an accord.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One of the last remaining obstacles is how quickly the US will lift sanctions on Iran once a deal is reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, warned the West on Monday: "If they want an agreement, sanctions must go."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Netanyahu's speech to a joint session of Congress is intended to galvanise US opposition to a deal ahead of what may be a bruising fight between the White House and Republicans over lifting sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The purpose of my address to Congress tomorrow is to speak up about a potential deal with Iran that could threaten the survival of Israel," Mr Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While Mr Obama's negotiators might be able to reach a deal with the Iranians in Switzerland, the White House will then face a difficult domestic battle to implement it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Republicans and some Democrats are demanding that the final terms of the deal be submitted to a vote in Congress, where Mr Obama's opponents control both chambers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Obama can also suspend some sanctions on his own but he will need a vote in Congress to permanently roll them back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Republicans and many pro-Israel Democrats are likely to fight any easing of the screws on Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Netanyahu, who faces his own elections on March 17, was invited to speak by Republicans in Congress without consulting Mr Obama, in what the White House said was a breach of protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Susan Rice, the president's national security adviser, said Mr Netanyahu's apparent alignment with Republicans was "destructive" of the US-Israel relationship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Israeli leader was somewhat conciliatory on Monday saying his visit was being "misperceived" as a partisan move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the esteemed office that he holds," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Yet Mr Netanyahu was blunt that US and Israel "disagree" on Iran and he praised the Israeli ambassador to Washington, who orchestrated his controversial speech, as "a man who knows how to take the heat".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He insisted that the two countries would "weather the current disagreement" and their friendship would "grow even stronger in the future".</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In an interview with Reuters, Mr Obama tried to talk down the rift with Israel, saying his differences with Mr Netanyahu would not be "permanently destructive" to ties between the countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He suggested, however, that his Israeli counterpart was being alarmist in his opposition to the potential deal, saying "Netanyahu made all sorts of claims" in the past that turned out not to be true.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN, also attempted to smooth over some of the public cracks in the relationship in a speech moments before Mr Netayahu's at the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The United States of America will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon, period," Ms Power said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"There will never be a sunset on America's commitment to Israel's security, never."</td></tr>
