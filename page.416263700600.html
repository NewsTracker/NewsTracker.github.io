<h3>EU alleges Google's abuses hurt consumers, innovation</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>European Union's competition chief Margrethe Vestager listens to questions during a media conference at EU headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, April 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The European Union's executive hit Google with an official antitrust complaint on Wednesday that alleges the company abuses its dominance in Internet searches and also opened a probe into its Android mobile system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>BRUSSELS (AP) - The European Union's escalating legal attack on Google is likely to ignite a debate about whether the Internet search leader makes life more convenient for consumers or abuses its power to squeeze out rivals who might have something better to offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The contrasting views of Google's business practices came into sharper focus Wednesday after Europe's antitrust regulators challenged the Mountain View, California, company on two different fronts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Drawing upon a nearly five-year probe, the regulators filed a complaint alleging that Google has been improperly favoring its own shopping comparison service in its own search results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The charges could still be expanded to include other services highlighted in Google's search results, such as travel recommendations and merchant reviews, mounting a challenge to the digital advertising system that generates most of the company's revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As if that blow wasn't enough, Europe's regulators also announced they are opening a separate inquiry into whether Google has been illegally using its popular Android software to bully smartphone and tablet makers to feature Google's products on their mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Google staunchly denied any wrongdoing, setting up a showdown that could still take years to resolve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The company has 10 weeks to respond to Wednesday's complaint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>GOOD OR BAD FOR CONSUMERS?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>For now at least, Europe's case is focused on Google's shopping comparison service, known as Google Shopping, which shows various products and prices when consumers make a search request indicating they are looking to buy something.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Google Shopping consistently ranks at the top of Google's search results page to the detriment of competitors, including U.K.-based Foundem and Ciao, owned by Microsoft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Both those rivals are among the companies that spurred the EU's investigation into Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Regulators allege Google elevates its shopping service even when other options might have better deals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They maintain that Google Shopping is getting favorable treatment because the company wants it to succeed, unlike an earlier version called "Froogle," which wasn't pushed to the top of the search rankings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Google maintains that it is just trying to package its search results in a way that makes it easier for consumers to find what they want.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But Google's shopping comparison service doesn't include all products in any category.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Google began locking out some merchants in late 2012 when it began requiring an upfront payment - the equivalent of an ad - to be included in the index of the shopping comparison service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"People don't realize there's a pay-to-play element of Google Shopping," said William Poundstone, author of "Are you Smart Enough to Work at Google?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The popularity of Google's search engine is the main reason why European regulators are trying to force the company to change its ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Dominant companies have a responsibility not to abuse their powerful market position," said Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She contends Google is limiting the choices of European consumers and stifling innovation among smaller companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Google maintains people use its search engine because of its reputation for delivering the best results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The company also points out that it is facing more completion than ever, including: other search engines such as Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo; e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com and eBay, where consumers go directly to compare products; mobile apps, where people increasingly spend their time online; and relatively new networking tools such as Pinterest that have unleashed new ways for people to discover intriguing ideas and products.</td></tr>
