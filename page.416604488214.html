<h3>Dutch plan nationwide bid for 2019 European Games</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN (Reuters) - The Netherlands will launch a bid to host the second edition of the European Games in 2019, planning a financially low-risk nationwide concept for the continental competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The inaugural European Games is being held in Baku, Azerbaijan in June and will be the first continental multi-sports event for the region's senior athletes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The organization of the European Games in 2019 is a special opportunity for the Netherlands," the Dutch Olympic committee said in a statement after their general assembly on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The Netherlands has the opportunity to present itself as a prime example of how to organize a 'next level' multi-sport event."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The new event is based on a concept similar to other regional gatherings such as the Pan-American or Asian Games and are scheduled to be held a year prior to the Summer Olympics with qualifying spots and points on offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They are also seen as a chance for smaller cities to bid for a major sporting event with a budget a fraction of the size needed to host an Olympics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Games will also serve as a springboard for future Summer Olympic candidacies with Baku already mulling a possible bid for the 2024 Olympics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The 2019 Games will themselves help develop top talent, provide inspiration to young people in the Netherlands and enthusiasm among the population," Dutch Olympic Committee head Andre Bolhuis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bolhuis added that the bid would not see any major infrastructure investment and financial guarantees from the relevant bodies would be secured this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There is no other official candidate for the 2019 edition with the European Olympic Committees (EOC), in charge of the Games, saying a decision on the host city would be made later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The European Games will also have competition from the European Sports championships to be launched in 2018.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Dutch have a long Olympic involvement with Amsterdam hosting the 1928 Olympics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>King Willem-Alexander is also a former International Olympic Committee (IOC) member.</td></tr>
