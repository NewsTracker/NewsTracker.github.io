<h3>Egypt's cabinet approves long-awaited investment law: prime minister</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But they are often not embraced by society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>The government is seeking to address foreign business concerns before an investment conference in Sharm el-Sheikh set for mid-March, when Egypt hopes to secure domestic and foreign investment of up to $12 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A study found Germans with immigrant roots are often passed over for apprenticeships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Announcing the new law, Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb said in a statement the government held discussions with investors, an industry association, law advisors and members of civil society when drawing up the legislation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This week, NPR has been exploring what life is like for Muslims in Europe - this, at a time when image of Muslims has been co-opted by small number of violent extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It will now be referred to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is expected to ratify it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Our colleague, Audie Cornish, and a team from All Things Considered have been visiting three countries in Europe with large Muslim populations, the U.K., France and Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"If it hadn't been for this law, there would be no Sharm el-Sheikh conference. It will be the main focus of the conference," said Mohsen Adel, deputy head of the Egyptian Association for Financing and Investment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>We're hearing from our colleagues based in Europe as well, including Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Germany, which is home to about 4 million Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>One of the most important elements of the law is the imposition of punishments on the company and the guilty employee, as opposed to the previous practice of often making top executives responsible for violations committed by staffers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>GREENE: Many were born and raised in Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We had chaos before," Adel said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But they are often not embraced by German society or the workplace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Now the employee who committed a mistake will be punished and the entity itself will incur punishments, like fines, or freezing activities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A recent study found young Germans with immigrant roots, especially Muslim ones, are often passed over for the nation's coveted apprenticeship spots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The law provides certain guarantees including for deals signed with governments, and allows for incentives to encourage the funding of labour-intensive projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Soraya has this report from Hamburg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Sisi, often criticised for a security crackdown against his political opponents, has embarked on a series of economic reforms since taking office last year that have won praise from investors traditionally wary of plunging cash into Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>BURAK KARAKUS: (Speaking German).</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Investment Minister Ashraf Salman told Reuters in January that the new law was critical to winning the confidence of foreign investors who currently must secure permits from 78 government agencies to start a company in Egypt -- a process that can take up to five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Learning how to talk to clients is an important part of Burak Karakus's training at this Hamburg-based commercial trading company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The legislation creates a "one-stop shop" to make Egypt, the most populous Arab nation, more attractive for foreign money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The 23-year-old, German-born son of Turkish immigrants is an apprentice in the export business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Angus Blair, chairman of business and economic forecasting think-tank Signet, told Reuters: "The whole investment system is antiquated and needs a complete overhaul."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He says it wasn't his first choice of a career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Egypt's economic growth rate over the last three years was around 2 percent, too slow to reduce widespread unemployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>What he really wanted to do was become a businessman in the automotive industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But Karakus says after applying for at least 150 apprenticeships in that field, he gave up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He says in two years, he could barely get an interview - let alone a spot - despite earning high scores on his exit exams from a top-tiered German high school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>KARAKUS: (Speaking German).</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>NELSON: "I would apply 10 times to the same company in one month, just to show them how interested I was," Karakus says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"But I never heard back. And each time when I checked the website, it would still say help wanted."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Karakus is hardly alone in Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>AYDAN OZOGUZ: (Speaking German).</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>NELSON: Aydan Ozoguz, who is the country's commissioner for migration, refugees and integration, says young people with Arabic or Turkish-sounding names have a much lower chance of landing an apprenticeship than those with German-sounding names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That can be a career killer, as apprenticeships are vital here if you want to join a trade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A Bertelsmann Foundation study released in January backs the commissioner's claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It found that while a quarter of young Germans have foreign roots, 85 percent of German companies offering apprenticeships aren't training any of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The study also found only one in three of such companies ever trained an apprentice with immigrant roots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Claudia Burkard is the project manager in charge of the study, which looked at about a thousand companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>CLAUDIA BURKARD: The great majority of the companies, about three-quarters, told us that it's because they don't get applications from young people with migration backgrounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But it doesn't seem very plausible, as other studies and surveys show that the application behavior of young people with migration backgrounds doesn't differ significantly from those without.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>NELSON: She says companies' reservations are based on misplaced fears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>BURKARD: It's more that the fear of language barriers means that companies shy away from the risk of having an apprentice who might fail or quit because of language difficulties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>NELSON: Burkard says German companies should be strongly encouraged to train immigrants and see their capabilities rather than presumed deficits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>She adds the government must also help young Germans by guaranteeing vocational education.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News.</td></tr>
