<h3>Two Secret Service agents under investigation for allegedly driving car into White House barricade after party</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Officers on duty who witnessed the March 4 incident wanted to arrest the agents and conduct sobriety tests, according to a current and a former government official familiar with the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But the officers were ordered by a supervisor on duty that night to let the agents go home, said these people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive internal matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The episode presents an early test for the Secret Service's new director, Joseph Clancy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama last month following a string of security lapses at the White House and other embarrassing missteps and had vowed to restore the agency's once-stellar reputation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Clancy on Monday directed that the inquiry be led by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, in part because the incident involves such senior officials, a law enforcement official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Agency spokesman Brian Leary confirmed the investigation after questions from The Washington Post, saying the Secret Service was "aware of the allegations of misconduct involving two of our employees."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He declined to specify which allegations are the focus of the inquiry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"If misconduct is identified, appropriate action will be taken based on established rules and regulations," Leary said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He added that the agency "will fully cooperate" with the inspector general's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>An administration official said that in "recent days," the White House had been "made aware of the allegations and the steps being taken by the Secret Service to ensure that the incident is thoroughly investigated."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The agents under investigation are Mark Connolly, the second-in-command on Obama's detail, and George Ogilvie, a senior supervisor in the Washington field office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Connolly and Ogilvie declined to comment through the Secret Service spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>An agency official said the two employees had been moved to "non-supervisory, non-operational assignments."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They were not put on administrative leave, which has been a typical procedure when agents are under investigation for alleged misconduct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The incident happened at about 10:30 p.m. on the White House compound near 15th Street NW and Freedom Park, as Metropolitan Police Department and Secret Service officers were trying to clear the scene due to an investigation of a suspicious package, according to the people familiar with the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Witnesses reported that the car's overhead flashing lights had been activated and both agents were showing their badges to get through the section of the grounds that had been closed off, according to people familiar with the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The vehicle ran through security tape before hitting the barricades, which an agency official said had been set up temporarily during the investigation of the package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Secret Service rules prohibit turning on flashing lights without a security reason and driving a government vehicle after drinking alcohol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The two men had been attending a party at a nearby Washington bar to honor the retirement of departing Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Two people familiar with the incident said it was likely captured on Secret Service video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They said all of the agents' activities on that part of the compound would have likely been streamed live to the agency's emergency command center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The incident violated security protocols, according to several veteran agents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>At the time that the agents drove into the barricade, disrupting an active investigation, officers had not yet determined whether the suspicious package was a threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>If a civilian drives through a White House security barrier, officers are trained to release an attack dog or point loaded guns at the driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In October 2013, a Connecticut woman was shot and killed by police after she rammed a temporary security barrier outside the White House with her car, and then struck a Secret Service uniformed division officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>She fled in her car, prompting a police chase that ended with both Capitol Police and Secret Service officers shooting multiple rounds and killing her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Her 1-year-old child was inside the car but not hurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Last week's incident is the first major misstep to take place since the management shake-up that began last October, when then-Director Julia Pierson abruptly resigned in the weeks after a man was able jump the White House fence and race through much of the mansion's main floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Clancy took over as acting director, moving later to force out much of the senior management team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>An independent panel created by the Department of Homeland Security to examine the Secret Service's problems strongly recommended late last year that the president choose an outsider as the new director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The panel said the agency was "starved for leadership" with fresh perspectives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But Obama went with a trusted hand, picking Clancy, a 27-year veteran of the agency who had headed Obama's security detail early in his administration and who had also worked with Connolly.</td></tr>

<h3>Video captures exact moment two police officers were shot last night in Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In the video, an unidentified woman is filming the protest when the gunshots are heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This is then followed by what sounds like groaning and then a taunt from the crowd (it's unclear if the taunter knew anyone had been hit when he yelled out).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The woman shooting the video lets out an expletive and explains that the police now have guns drawn pointing at the crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In the moments after the AP version video finishes, she also checks on her friend then stares in incredulity as she realizes he has not stopped grilling on his barbecue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A 32-year-old officer from nearby Webster Groves was shot in the face and a 41-year-old officer from St. Louis County was shot in the shoulder, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Both were taken to a hospital, where Belmar said they were conscious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said he did not have further details about their conditions but described their injuries as "serious."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I don't know who did the shooting, to be honest with you," Belmar said, adding that he could not provide a description of the suspect or gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He said his "assumption" was that, based on where the officers were standing and the trajectory of the bullets, "these shots were directed exactly at my officers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The shots were fired shortly after midnight as protesters were gathered following the resignation of embattled Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Before the shooting, some at the protest were chanting to show they weren't satisfied with the resignations of Jackson and City Manager John Shaw earlier in the week, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Authorities from multiple agencies had gathered outside of the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The protest was a familiar scene in Ferguson, which saw similar and much larger demonstrations after the shooting death of black 18-year-old Michael Brown last summer by city police officer Darren Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>When Wilson, who is white, was cleared in November by a state grand jury, the decision set off further protests, looting and fires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But Wednesday was the first time an officer at a protest had been shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Marciay Pitchford, 20, was among the protesters outside the police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She told The Associated Press the protest had been mostly peaceful until she heard the shots ring out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I saw the officer go down and the other police officers drew their guns while other officers dragged the injured officer away," Pitchford said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"All of a sudden everybody started running or dropping to the ground."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Belmar said the shots were fired from across the street from the police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>After the shooting, officers with guns and in riot gear circled the station, and more than a dozen squad cars blocked the street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Jackson was the sixth employee to resign or be fired after a Justice Department report last week cleared Wilson of civil rights charges in the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Wilson has since resigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A separate Justice Department report released the same day found a profit-driven court system and widespread racial bias in the city police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mayor James Knowles III announced Wednesday that the city had reached a mutual separation agreement with Jackson that will pay Jackson one year of his nearly $96,000 annual salary and health coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Jackson's resignation becomes effective March 19, at which point Lt. Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Al Eickhoff will become acting chief while the city searches for a replacement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Jackson had previously resisted calls by protesters and some of Missouri's top elected leaders to step down over his handling of Brown's shooting and the weeks of protests that followed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He was widely criticized from the outset, both for an aggressive police response to protesters and for his agency's erratic and infrequent releases of key information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He took nearly a week to publicly identify Wilson as the shooter and then further heightened tension in the community by releasing Wilson's name at the same time as store security video that police said showed Brown stealing a box of cigars and shoving a clerk only a short time before his death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>During a 12-minute news conference, Knowles said Jackson resigned after "a lot of soul-searching" about how the community could heal from the racial unrest stemming from the fatal shooting last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"The chief is the kind of honorable man you don't have to go to," Knowles said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"He comes to you when he knows that this is something we have to seriously discuss."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights division released a statement saying the U.S. government remains committed to reaching a "court-enforceable agreement" to address Ferguson's "unconstitutional practices," regardless of who's in charge of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Jackson oversaw the Ferguson force for nearly five years before the shooting that stirred months of unrest across the St. Louis region and drew global attention to the predominantly black city of 21,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>In addition to Jackson, Ferguson's court clerk was fired last week and two police officers resigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The judge who oversaw the court system also resigned, and the City Council on Tuesday agreed to a separation agreement with Shaw, the city manager.</td></tr>
