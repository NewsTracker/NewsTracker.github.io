<h3>Westminster show dog owners bemoan Delta for losing pets at</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A pack of prize pooches endured a ruff departure after they competed in this year's Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The owners of Romeo, Paris and Leonard panicked for hours Wednesday, not knowing what Delta Airlines did with their pets as they awaited their flight back to the Pacific Northwest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"In those four hours, oh man, we went all over the place," Sarah Pearce, the 17-year-old owner of Romeo, told the Daily News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They told us they had no idea where our dogs were."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Five dogs were booked for Delta's 4:05 p.m. flight to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, but they were a no-show for takeoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It got so stressful that three owners stayed an extra night in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greg Gorder sounded the alarm when he failed to see his granddaughter's dog being loaded into the cargo hold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>When the airline's luggage tracker failed to find the checked carrier, he asked airline employees to confirm whether his fluffy friend was onboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They couldn't do it, wouldn't do it," Gorder told KOMO-TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That's when he and Sarah Pearce got off the plane and waited hours until their canines turned up safe and sound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I was livid," Jenny Dawson told the TV station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hours after she got off the plane, Dawson discovered her terrier, Leonard, had been onboard another flight all along.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>"It's not as tragic as it seems - unless it's your dog," Westminster Kennel Club spokesman David Frier told The News, noting that other dogs have fared far worse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Tragedy struck in 2006, when Vivi, an award-winning Whippet, escaped her cage and vanished from the Kennedy Airport grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The 3-year-old dog was last seen sprinting to freedom in the oceanside marshes of Queens.</td></tr>
