<h3>Baltimore police fatally shoot unarmed black man</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Less than two months after tensions between police and those protesting against the death Freddie Gray (as depicted in this photo) hit a boiling point, an unarmed black man has been killed by police on June 25, 2015 in Baltimore, Maryland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>OWINGS MILLS, Md.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>-- An unarmed black man was fatally shot Thursday by officers in suburban Baltimore who thought he had a weapon when they were called to a home from which he was barred by protective order, the police chief said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The death follows that of a 25-year-old black man who died in April from an injury suffered in the custody of Baltimore city police, which prompted protests and rioting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And it comes amid a national debate over the treatment of African-Americans at the hands of police, after high-profile deaths of black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Spencer Lee McCain, 41, was shot about 1 a.m. at the home in Owings Mills while a woman who said he threatened to beat her and her two young children were there, Baltimore County Police Chief Jim Johnson said at a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Three officers were on the scene, and all fired as McCain was in a "defensive position" and they thought he had a weapon, Johnson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But he said no weapon was found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Two of the officers are white, and one is black, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>All are on administrative leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Police said the incident began when one of the children in the home called his grandmother, who called 911 and asked police to go there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>An officer who arrived heard screams and called for backup, Johnson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said 19 casings were found at the scene, but it wasn't clear how many times McCain was hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Police said the woman had head injuries, cuts, bruises and swelling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Johnson said she told detectives that McCain said to her, "You're going to get the beating you deserve."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Sixteen to 20 domestic violence calls had been made to that home address since 2012, police spokesman Cpl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>John Wachter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>According to 2013 census figures, 27.5% of Baltimore County's population is black and 64.1% is white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The police chief and county executive are white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>As of February, black people made up less than 13% of the county's 1,868-member police force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A medical examiner ruled this week that the death of Freddie Gray was a homicide, after he suffered a "high-energy injury," most likely caused when a Baltimore city police van he was riding in suddenly slowed down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A grand jury indicted six officers on various charges; one officer faces the most serious charge of second-degree "depraved-heart" murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>They have pleaded not guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The report said Freddie Gray's death could not be ruled an accident and is instead a homicide because officers didn't follow safety procedures "through acts of omission."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Police and an attorney for the Gray family have said previously that Gray suffered a severe spine injury.</td></tr>
