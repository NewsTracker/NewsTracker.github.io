<tr><td>10</td><td>The plane sent out a distress signal at 10.45am local time (9.45am GMT).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The boss of Germanwings said the plane went into a long descent before it crashed.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>"At 11.30, I heard a series of loud noises in the air. There are often fighter jets flying over, so I thought it sounded just like that. I looked outside, but I couldn't see any fighter planes," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The noise I heard was long - like eight seconds - as if the plane was going more slowly than a military plane. There was another long noise after about 30 seconds."</td></tr>

<tr><td>44</td><td>She reminded everyone that the cause was not known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"We still don't know much beyond the bare information on the flight, and there should be no speculation on the cause of the crash," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"All that will be investigated thoroughly."</td></tr>
