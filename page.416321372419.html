<h3>Attorneys seek dismissal of charges in Islamic State case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lawyers for 19-year-old Mohammed Hamzah Khan also filed a motion Friday in U.S. District Court in Chicago seeking to suppress statements he made to law enforcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In seeking to dismiss the charges, Khan's attorneys contend the desire he expressed to "emigrate" to an "Islamic state" was just an expression of his religious freedom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They say a letter to his parents is evidence of his intent to emigrate, not to supply material support to the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Khan's lawyers also say his statements to investigators were made prior to his receiving a Miranda warning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They say his post-Miranda statements should be suppressed because they resulted from the previous statements.</td></tr>
