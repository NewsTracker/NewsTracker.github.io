<h3>No. 2 leader of Islamic State killed in US-led airstrike: Iraq</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An airstrike by the US-led coalition on Islamic State group positions in Ramadi, Iraq last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Baghdad: The Iraqi government has said that the second in command of the Islamic State had been killed in an airstrike carried out by the US-led coalition in northern Iraq, a claim that US officials said they could not confirm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Iraq's Ministry of Defence said on Wednesday that the militant leader, known as Abu Alaa al-Afari, was killed in a strike near the northern city Tal Afar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The US Central Command acknowledged that airstrikes were conducted against the Islamic State near Tal Afar on Tuesday and Wednesday but could not verify the government's claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An Islamic State militant holding a pistol in an image from a propaganda video released in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a statement released on its website, the Defence Ministry said that, "based on accurate intelligence", a coalition airstrike had targeted al-Afari and several other leaders who had gathered in a mosque.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Iraqi state television showed an aerial video of a building being blown up that it said was the strike in which al-Afari was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But it was unclear from the video whether the building was a mosque, and Central Command flatly denied that the airstrikes had been conducted against any mosque.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The death of al-Afari, if true, would represent a serious blow to the leadership of the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Iraqi officials, over the years, have frequently made claims about the deaths of terrorist leaders that later turned out to be untrue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Islamic State militants captured by Shiite paramilitary forces in Tikrit in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A previous leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, the predecessor to the Islamic State, was claimed to have been killed several times, and his supposed death became a running joke in the Iraqi media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Another well-known Islamic State militant, an Iraqi named Shaker Waheeb, has on several occasions been reported dead by Iraqi officials, and each time he emerged alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Al-Afari, who also goes by several other assumed names, was recently added to a US government list offering rewards for information leading to the death or capture of top Islamic State leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The list, which identified al-Afari as Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli and said he had been a top deputy to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, offered a $US7 million ($8.6 million) bounty for al-Afari.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Al-Afari is said to be the deputy to the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who himself has been the subject of a swirl of rumours lately that he was injured in an airstrike in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>British newspapers reported that al-Baghdadi was incapacitated by an airstrike and had turned the day-to-day running of the terrorist organisation over to al-Afari.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>US officials have also said those claims could not be verified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On Wednesday, General Tahseen Ibrahim, the spokesman for Iraq's Ministry of Defence who announced the death of al-Afari, said that the best intelligence he had seen suggested that al-Baghdadi had, indeed, been injured, but was not incapacitated and was still in charge of the organisation.</td></tr>
