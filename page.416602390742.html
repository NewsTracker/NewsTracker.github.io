<h3>Spurs edge Clippers 111-107 in pivotal Game 5 on late call (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ball bounced around the rim, and the pivotal fifth game of a thrilling first-round series teetered along with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>DeAndre Jordan leaped up and tapped it in - an instant too early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The San Antonio Spurs got the biggest bounce in a game full of them, and the champs landed on the brink of the second round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tim Duncan scored 21 points before Jordan was called for basket interference with 4.3 seconds left, and the Spurs hung on for a 111-107 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 5 on Tuesday night, taking a 3-2 series lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>San Antonio earned the chance to close it out at home on Thursday night, but only after its lead dwindled to 108-107 in the frantic final minute at Staples Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Blake Griffin launched a leaping leaner off an inbounds play with 6.9 seconds left, but it rattled around the basket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jordan, who had 21 points and 14 rebounds, grazed the ball while it appeared to be inside the cylinder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''It was a dumb play,'' said Jordan, who sat at his locker long after the game ended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''I hit the ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>We did a good job fighting to put us in a situation to go up one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>You can't blame anybody on that but me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The officials decisively waved off the basket while Jordan waved his hands pleadingly, but the Clippers still hoped for a reversal on video review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The good news went to the Spurs, who have thrived in this series with slim margins of success - none smaller than this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''That was the play of the game,'' said Manu Ginobili, who scored 14 points off the bench.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''That's why I say we got lucky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The ball was going in, and he happened to touch it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That would have put us down one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Instead, it was a completely different ballgame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>When the interference call was upheld, the Spurs' bench cheered while the Clippers' fans greeted it with resigned acceptance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Spurs hit three late free throws to pad the final score.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''I thought it was the right call,'' Clippers coach Doc Rivers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''I couldn't tell, you know, and I couldn't see it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Duncan capped a vintage performance with a key block on Griffin in the final minute, while Kawhi Leonard scored 18 points for the five-time NBA champion Spurs, who won their second straight game in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The champs took a seven-point lead in the fourth and hung on after the Clippers cut it to one on Matt Barnes' free throws with 30.8 seconds left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''It was anybody's game,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>27</td><td>Griffin had 30 points and 14 rebounds, but missed two free throws with 39 seconds to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Los Angeles missed 16 free throws overall and went 1 for 14 on 3-pointers while getting pushed to the brink.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''It's tough, but the series isn't over,'' Griffin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>This otherwise entertaining series grinded to a crawl in a lengthy third quarter featuring 35 combined free throws, but it picked up again in a tense fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Spurs intentionally fouled Jordan eight times in the middle quarters, resuming their hack-happy assault on the Clippers' poor-shooting center in the middle quarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>San Antonio made a decisive 10-4 surge in the final minutes aided by a technical foul on Chris Paul, who had 19 points and 10 assists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''It's tough, but we can't get it back,'' Paul said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Rivers hoped his team would respond better to its second victory than its first in a series filled with serious momentum shifts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Los Angeles won the opener comfortably, but then lost two straight in an overtime thriller and a blowout.</td></tr>

<tr><td>37</td><td>The series' fever pitch extended right into Game 5 in front of a success-hungry crowd waving red towels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>San Antonio kept it close in the first half with superior bench play: Along with Ginobili, Patty Mills added 13 and Boris Diaw had 10 off the bench, including a remarkable fling at the basket to beat the shot clock with 2:52 to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The Spurs intentionally fouled Jordan three times late in the first half, resuming the divisive strategy that even Popovich claims he uses reluctantly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Jordan, a dismal free-throw shooter, missed four of six before Rivers pulled him out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>San Antonio committed five more intentional fouls against Jordan in the third quarter before Rivers pulled him again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>He finished 7 for 16 at the line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Spurs: San Antonio has won 11 of its 14 best-of-seven series when tied 2-2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>... The Spurs' bench outscored the Clippers' reserves 48-17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Clippers: Rivers barely dipped into his bench, using only three reserves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Spencer Hawes and Hedo Turkoglu never got into the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>... J.J. Redick fouled out with 13 points.</td></tr>
