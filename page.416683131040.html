<h3>Damaged, ruined by deadly quake, fate of Nepal's beloved heritage sites in doubt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal - The blue-rimmed eyes of Kathmandu's gold-spired Swayambhunath stupa stare silently from a hilltop overlooking this city in the Himalayan foothills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But since Nepal was shattered by a mammoth earthquake Saturday, those eyes have gazed upon a nation in mourning - and on a microcosm of destruction and despair inside the ancient temple itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Here, monkeys scurry across the demolished ruins of a pair of precious bullet-shaped edifices built by King Pratap Malla in the 1600s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Saffron-robed monks haul golden relics and carpets out of a ruined monastery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The temple now has its own population of displaced - priests and vendors huddle under tents, sleeping in darkness waiting for authorities try to repair downed power lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Swayambhunath, which dates back to the 5th century, is one of at least 68 cultural heritage sites in Nepal that were damaged by the tremor, according to Nipuna Shrestha of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, citing preliminary figures from the Department of Archaeology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That's nearly 80 percent of historic landmarks in seven monument zones that have been declared as World Heritage Sites in the Kathmandu Valley alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Few would compare the loss of Nepal's historic treasures to the massive human misery wrought by the magnitude-7.8 quake, which has claimed more than 6,600 lives, damaged more than have a million homes, and displaced nearly 3 million people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And yet, "it's hard to describe how painful this is," Shrestha said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"These are not just monuments, they are part of our daily life. It feels like losing part of your family."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Shrestha said at least 18 other monuments are known to have been damaged elsewhere, but information has been incomplete because phone lines have been disrupted and roads cut off by avalanches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The sites most heavily affected were made of brick and wood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Terrifying footage posted on YouTube of the moment the quake hit one temple complex in Bhaktapur, just east of the capital, shows chunks falling from the top of a crumbling temple as it is enshrouded in a cloud of brown dust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Tourists can be heard screaming as some struggle to stand and others run from the collapsing buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Speaking earlier this week, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala said the government's first priority was relief and rescue for all those affected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But he also vowed to rebuild "all structures of historical, religious and archaeological significance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In an impoverished country that is already struggling to help the living, though, it is unclear when that will happen, or how.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Among the landmarks destroyed in the capital was the iconic, nine-story Dharahara Tower, which was topped by a statue of Shiva - the god of destruction in Hinduism, the predominant religion among Nepal's 27.8 million people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The second biggest is Buddhism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Police say at least 60 bodies were recovered, most of whom were inside the tower's 213-step spiral staircase at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Built in 1832, Dharahara was partially destroyed during a 1934 quake, and like many sites that were toppled across the country, eventually rebuilt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The tower once offered panoramic views of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>All that remains now is its base, the rest having smashed into the ground surrounding it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Amrit Sharma, an Indian national who grew up in Kathmandu and has spent most of his life here, said the tower was like "our Washington Monument, our Empire State building."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The damage to these sites is not just a huge loss for Nepal, it's a huge loss for humanity," Sharma said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"People come from all over the world to see these. But they're not just tourist attractions to us. If we lose them, we lose a sense of our past."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Among the worst hit sites was Kathmandu's historic center, Basantapur Durbar Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Built between the 12th and 18th centuries, it is a place where kings have been coronated and religious festivals are regularly held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Archaeology Department website calls the complex "an open museum of Nepalese culture, art and architecture."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Steps that once led to a pair of pagoda-style Hindu temples with multi-tiered roofs now lead to nowhere, resembling giant anthills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>One of them, Kasthamandap, was built five centuries ago and is believed to have been constructed from the timber of a single tree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Elsewhere, a 17th-century statue of Garuda, a bird-like creature in Hinduism revered as the mount of god Vishnu, lies at the bottom of a tall stone pillar it once adorned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Other temples have been leveled completely.</td></tr>
