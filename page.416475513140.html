<h3>'Time running out' for Greece deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The eurozone's top official has said "time is running out" for Greece to reach a deal with bailout creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem said there is a "great sense of urgency" from all sides to get a deal done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But as he went into discussions with his colleagues in the 19-country eurozone he dashed any expectations that one would be secured at the meeting in the Latvian capital of Riga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said it is particularly important for Athens that a deal is secured soon so the country can get the financial support it needs "to make sure there's enough money available to keep the government running".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece had a target of the end of April to agree to more reforms in exchange for rescue money its creditors had set aside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Without the money, Greece faces potential bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Dijsselbloem noted that "April isn't over yet" but said the deadline was far more important for Athens than the Eurogroup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>For weeks, the meeting in Riga was expected to be the one where Greece's immediate financial future would be sorted out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Its left-wing government, elected in January on a mandate to bring crippling austerity to an end, was expected to present its reform plans to its creditors in the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If all worked out as planned, Greece would be handed the remaining money available in its bailout programme - 7.2 billion euro ( 5.2 billion) - to pay off upcoming debts to its creditors in the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But after weeks of tortuous discussions that have yielded little besides distrust, Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is not expected to present any reform plans at the meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Creditors have demanded reforms that include sweeping changes to pensions and labour rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the Greek government has ruled out many key demands, arguing it was elected to end the kind of stifling budget austerity that contributed to a 25% contraction in the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Its focus is geared far more on fighting corruption and increasing its tax take than more cuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Though fears of a potential Greek debt default and a subsequent exit from the euro have ratcheted up in recent weeks, the prevailing view in markets is a deal will be reached after much soul-searching and bickering - as in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Many in the markets think Greece has until May 11, when eurozone finance ministers are scheduled to meet next, to secure a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"While the prospects of possible Greek default haven't receded, it would appear that the timing has been delayed once again as both sides try and come to a deal that they can somehow sell as a solution that will satisfy everybody," said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Varoufakis did not speak to reporters as he entered the meeting but insisted in a blog post published today that the "current disagreements are not unbridgeable".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said there already is common ground, particularly on revamping the tax system and making pensions fit for purpose by, for example, limiting early retirement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"The Greek government wants a fiscal-consolidation path that makes sense, and we want reforms that all sides believe are important," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Slovakia's finance minister, Peter Kazimir, showed little optimism that a deal would be agreed in the coming days and even ventured that Athens has until the end of June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The end of June is the most important," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He commented on the lack of progress, saying he was "a little bit tired" by the failure of the Greek authorities to present a properly costed set of proposals that would help break the logjam.</td></tr>
