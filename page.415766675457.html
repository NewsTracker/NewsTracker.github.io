<h3>Robinson says Ferguson&#039;s ready for Raiders</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sydney Roosters star Blake Ferguson is ready to face his former club Canberra for the first time since they sacked him in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson has challenged born-again Blake Ferguson to back up his two-try haul with another defining performance against Canberra on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Fresh from his match-winning heroics in Monday night's 20-12 victory over Penrith, Ferguson confronts his past when he faces the Raiders for the first time since being sacked by the NRL club in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The one-time NSW State of Origin star is certain to attract extra attention at Allianz Stadium but Robinson is confident Ferguson is big enough and mature enough to cope.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Now it's time for him to go and prove that," Robinson said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's easy to find a fight every week, a reason to do well, but his pressure's internal and he's got to make sure that he performs each week based on his standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"If you're rising and falling based on who you're playing, then you're in trouble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"So I'm more than confident that Blake will have a really strong game again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ferguson gets the chance to upstage his ex-teammates just four rounds into his NRL comeback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Robinson is hoping the Roosters deliver a similar performance to that when Sonny Bill Williams inspired the tricolours to a 38-0 win over the Bulldogs in the Kiwi superstar's much-hyped first outing against the club that sacked him five years earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Whenever it was going to be, there was always going to be a talking point around Blake playing Canberra," Robinson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I still remember when Sonny played Canterbury, it was a huge talking point and people were focused on Sonny versus Canterbury and Sonny focused on the Roosters versus Canterbury and that's the way to handle it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"That's the way that Blake needs to handle it and that's the way that we need to as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ferguson last week spoke of the love he feels at the Roosters after being handed a career lifeline after a two-year exile following his indecent assault conviction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's a bit of a scary word for footy players to say, but that's what it is," Robinson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"You want to make people feel comfortable. We've tried to create a home for him and the other players, and that's a by-product of that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It's an important thing to feel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Robinson said the Roosters and Ferguson had worked hard on helping the 25-year-old turn his life around and that it was a delight to see the backline talent making progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The structures are often really easy (to put in place)," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We've taken a bit of a different approach. We've tried to help him on a daily basis. How to train and prepare and also off the field on how to think about the way he lives his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"That's the best way. He makes better choices. It's not based on what the club says or does. It's based on what he thinks is right."</td></tr>
