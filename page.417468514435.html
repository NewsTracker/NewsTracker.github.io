<h3>Federer loses to pal Wawrinka in 3 sets at French Open (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PARIS (AP) -- Stumbling on his way to the net, Roger Federer dropped his racket and fell to his knees on the red clay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hardly the sort of grace and precision the world has come to expect from the 17-time Grand Slam champion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There were other unusual sights in Federer's 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (4) loss in the French Open quarterfinals Tuesday against his pal and Swiss Davis Cup teammate Stan Wawrinka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Rarely injured and appearing in a 62nd consecutive major, Federer received treatment on his right hand from a trainer during a second-set tiebreaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>For years and years, a dominant and confident force in tennis, Federer slumped in his changeover chair, head bowed, after falling behind two sets to none.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>So long superior to the younger Wawrinka, Federer was defeated for only the third time in their 19 head-to-head matches, and for the first time in five meetings at Grand Slam tournaments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>During the eight French Opens from 2005 to 2012, Federer reached at least the semifinals seven times, including winning the 2009 championship to complete a career Grand Slam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But this is now the third year in a row that Federer has exited Roland Garros in the quarterfinals or earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Give Wawrinka credit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Powering the ball from the baseline in Court Suzanne Lenglen on a windy day, he produced groundstrokes that cut through gusts topping 30 mph (50 kph).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Over at Court Philippe Chatrier, during the quarterfinal between Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Kei Nishikori, three people were injured when a piece of metal paneling was blown off a giant TV screen and fell on the stands below.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Late in the third set of Federer's loss, he missed a backhand that got caught in the wind and let out a guttural ''Aaaaah!</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He never managed to consistently find the range on his shots, and Wawrinka put together a 43-28 edge in winners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Wawrinka also managed to break Federer's serve three times, while saving all four break points he faced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>As well as Wawrinka played, he probably would have been just fine without the point conceded by Federer that made it 4-3 for the eventual winner after a disputed call in the tiebreaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This is his 11th appearance at Roland Garros, equaling the most in the professional era, which began in 1968, for a man getting to his first semifinal in Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Wawrinka next faces No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>5 Nishikori or No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>14 Tsonga, whose match was interrupted for about 40 minutes after the piece of metal hit a barrier and a piece of equipment on its way down, slowing its fall before tumbling onto packed rows of spectators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>French Open organizers said none of the injuries was serious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The quarterfinals on the other half of the men's draw are Wednesday, with a real blockbuster looming: No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>1 Novak Djokovic against nine-time champion Rafael Nadal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>No. 3 Andy Murray plays No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>7 David Ferrer in the other quarterfinal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>One women's semifinal was set Tuesday: No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>7 Ana Ivanovic of Serbia against No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>13 Lucie Safarova of Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Safarova, who beat defending champion Maria Sharapova in the fourth round, beat Garbine Muguruza 7-6 (3), 6-3 to reach the second major semifinal of her career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Ivanovic reached her first Grand Slam semifinal since winning the 2008 French Open, eliminating 20-year-old Elina Svitolina of Ukraine 6-3, 6-2.</td></tr>
