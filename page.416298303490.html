<h3>Wild open playoff series with 4-2 victory over Blues (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>''That was a fantastic road game,'' goalie Devan Dubnyk said after the Wild opened the playoffs strong with a 4-2 victory over the St. Louis Blues on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Wild tied the NHL record with 12 consecutive road victories late in the season before dropping a largely meaningless 4-2 decision in St. Louis in the finale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>During the run that matched the 2005-06 Red Wings, they beat the Blues 3-1 on March 13 in addition to three wins in Nashville and another in Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Before Game 1, though, they'd won just two of the previous 18 road playoff games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The exception came in overtime at Colorado to clinch the opening round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''If we did one thing well tonight, I thought we were opportunistic early,'' coach Mike Yeo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jason Zucker and Matt Dumba gave Minnesota a two-goal lead through two periods and the Wild kept chances to a minimum for Dubnyk until late.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jaden Schwartz and Alexander Steen scored in the third period for the Central Division champion Blues, but too little and too late.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Game 2 is on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Coach Ken Hitchcock and his players thought the four-day break after the finale was detrimental.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Wild also had four days to prepare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''I don't know if it was nerves or too much time off or what, but we didn't bring our 'A' game from the drop of the puck,'' captain David Backes said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Dubnyk, in his playoff debut, saw only 11 shots in the first two periods, and finished with 19 saves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Blues rookie Jake Allen, who finished the season 5-1-1 with a 1.32 goals-against average, also played in his first postseason game and had 25 saves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Hitchcock said the 24-year-old Allen, who got the nod over veteran Brian Elliott, will be in net again Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Allen took the setback in stride.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''I don't think we expected to win four straight,'' Allen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''We got one out of the way, got the nerves or the playoff jitters or whatever you want to call it out of the way for everyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There was a flurry of scoring in the final seconds, some of it after a standing-room crowd had headed for the exits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mikael Granlund's empty-netter made it a two-goal cushion with 1:13 to go, 7 seconds after Allen headed for the bench.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Steen scored with 58.7 seconds left for St. Louis, but Jason Pominville scored with 20 seconds left to clinch it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Wild scored on their second shot for the early lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Zucker, who missed last postseason with a knee injury and a big chunk of this year with a shoulder injury, got a step on Zbynek Michalek for an odd-angle shot and got the puck right back for a wraparound at 2:47.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''Obviously it was tough sitting out last year, but I've put that behind me,'' Zucker said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Schwartz, third on the Blues with 63 points, deflected a point shot by Kevin Shattenkirk at 7:12 of the third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Zucker had a career-best 21 goals, tied for third on the team, with just five assists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He served as his own setup man on the lone goal of the first period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''That guy's a speed demon,'' Allen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Dumba ripped a high one-timer past Allen, screened by two Wild players, on a power play at 4:10 of the second to make it 2-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>NOTES: Commissioner Gary Bettman attended the game and was non-committal on St. Louis getting an outdoor Winter Classic, aside from saying: ''I think at some point, we should be here.'' ... There were no surprises among the scratches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>D Robert Bortuzzo and C Olli Jokinen were out for the Blues, and F Matt Cooke was out for Minnesota.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>... Zucker scored 12 goals on the road during the regular season.</td></tr>
