<h3>Woman isolated for possible Ebola</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The unnamed woman returned to Australia on April 5 after working in an Ebola treatment centre in Liberia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That country hasn't had any cases recently and she hadn't actually treated any Ebola patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Health officials say it's most unlikely she has Ebola and her symptoms - a fever and stomach upset - are consistent with many other conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But she's being treated in complete isolation under the hospital's Ebola protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Professor Frank Bowden, chief medical administrator for ACT Health, said this was a precautionary measure with strict protocols to protect the patient, staff and the community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We believe that this patient has an extremely low risk of having Ebola," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Professor Bowden said it would be 72 hours before her diagnosis was definitely known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said the community should not be alarmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Here where the patient has an extremely low risk of Ebola, we know there is no risk to the public of Ebola."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dr Andrew Pengilley, acting ACT chief health officer, said this could be a normal stomach bug, malaria or a viral illness which affected people in West Africa as they did in Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Ebola is not a particularly transmissible infection under normal circumstances. It's transmitted by direct contact with bodily fluids so we are confident there is no risk to the wider community," he said.</td></tr>
