<tr><td>5</td><td>LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The NHL Players' Association has filed a grievance on behalf of center Mike Richards, contesting the termination of his contract by the Los Angeles Kings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Kings terminated the final five years of Richards' contract on June 29, saying the two-time Stanley Cup champion committed ''a material breach'' of his deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The team and Richards have said nothing else about the circumstances of his termination.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>Richards cleared waivers last season and was sent to the AHL because of his declining play and conditioning issues with the Kings, who acquired him from Philadelphia in 2011.</td></tr>
