<h3>EU adds 19 more names to sanctions list over Ukraine conflict</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The EU published the list, which also included nine entities, on Monday, one week after the EU foreign ministers decided on the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>There was a week's lapse in the publishing of the list because of the negotiations which led to an agreement between Ukraine and Russia last Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The additions bring the total of individuals hit with a travel ban and asset freeze to 151 while 37 entities are now also hit with restrictive measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The latest batch includes Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov, an outspoken critic of Ukraine, two more high-level officials linked to the military, and two state Duma officials who backed the annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Among the officials from the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, was Iosif Kobzon, who has been supportive of the separatists, and is also well known as a crooner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The entities targeted consist of eight armed separatist groups and one Russian movement backing the separatists in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A cease-fire in eastern Ukraine went into effect on Sunday but on Monday the two sides were accusing the other of violations.</td></tr>
