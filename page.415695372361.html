<h3>Nintendo: Netflixâ€™s Live-Action Zelda Series Might Not Happen After All</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Remember last month's news that had people jumping up and down because Netflix was developing a live-action Legend of Zelda series?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Well, we have potentially bad news now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Time interviewed Nintendo's Satoru Iwata, and, among many things, the CEO said that the Zelda rumors were inaccurate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"As of now, I have nothing new to share with you in regard to the use of our IPs for any TV shows or films," Iwata said, "but I can at least confirm that the article in question is not based on correct information."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>As Kotaku points out, this isn't the first time Nintendo's backpedaled for the sake of backpedaling (the company did it once with a 3DS XL announcement).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Fingers crossed that Iwata is just being media savvy; otherwise, we'll have to start riots and chant Long live live-action Link!</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Long live live-action Link!</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And nobody wants to see or hear that.</td></tr>
