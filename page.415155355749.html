<h3>Israel to blame for Australia&#039;s rise in anti-Semitism: Margoyles</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jewish actress Miriam Margolyes says that anti-Semitism is rising in Australia and Israel is to blame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ms Margolyes' comments, which sent "Miriam" trending across Australian Twitter accounts, came in response to a question from an audience member during the ABC's Q&A program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Speaking in the wake of the #IllRideWithYou campaign which supported Muslim Australians following the Sydney siege, questioner Erin Gordon asked the show's panellists why Australian Jews had not seen the same levels of support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Who would ride with us, the Australian Jews if we were to travel in particular areas of Sydney and our religious clothing?" she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Anti-Semitic attacks have risen 35 per cent in the past year and physical incidents 200 per cent. Why is there this precedent, yet we have received no widespread support from the general public?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ms Margolyes, who was raised in a Jewish household, said it was an uncomfortable truth, but people "don't like Jews" due to the actions of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She said the "appalling treatment of the Israelis towards the Palestinian and the settlements that have been built in contravention of the United Nations rulings " had led to an increase in anti-Semitism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Her views were disputed by Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who said he defended Israel's ability to "secure itself against some very hostile neighbours".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Frydenberg, also Jewish, said that instead some anti-Semitism was being driven by "hate media".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"People are being taught very young that Israel is always the source of all bad in that part of the world," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Their comments follow a number of anti-Semitic incidents in Australia, including the distribution of flyers calling for "White Australia" to "wake up" throughout Sydney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Anti-Muslim sentiment and widespread racism was also discussed, with panellist Trisha Jha speaking on her discomfort following the Cronulla riots in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ms Jha, a policy analyst for the Centre for Independent Studies, said the riots were a good example of where racism comes from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I know that it was something I felt uncomfortable about for many years as being visibly different.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I think that the kind of fear that [the questioner] was discussing, the kind of fear I have felt is something that only our fellow Australians can kind of smooth away. I think that's something that Australia needs to work on."</td></tr>

<h3>Nemtsov?s shaken girlfriend says she didn?t see killer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Speaking largely without emotion in deadened monosyllables, Ukrainian fashion model Anna Duritskaya said she had little recollection of what happened in the moments after Nemtsov was shot dead on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She told online news channel Dozhd that she had not noticed anything suspicious as the couple dined at a restaurant overlooking Red Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It had not occurred to her that someone might be following them as they headed across the river toward Nemtsov's apartment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I don't want to answer questions about what happened on the bridge. I don't want to talk about this," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I am in a very difficult psychological condition and I cannot talk about this any more now. I feel bad & I saw no one. I don't know where he came from, he was behind my back," she said of the killer or killers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nemtsov, 55, was shot several times and killed instantly, becoming the most prominent opposition figure to be murdered during President Vladimir Putin's 15-year rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tens of thousands of Russians marched through Moscow on Sunday to honor the former deputy prime minister and anti-corruption fighter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Duritskaya, who is 23 or 24, said she had been under constant guard since the murder and would probably be unable to attend Nemtsov's funeral on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>All she wanted to do was to go home to her mother in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I have every right to leave the territory of the Russian Federation. I am not a suspect. I am a witness who gave full testimony and did everything possible to assist the investigation," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"They are physically not allowing me to go anywhere without them," Duritskaya said, referring to law enforcement officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"They have explained to me that this is for security reasons."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nemtsov, an opposition politician whose murder has deepened a divide between liberals and Putin supporters, will be buried on Tuesday at the Troekurovskoye cemetery in western Moscow, far from where Russia's top politicians are usually buried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I cannot go out. Most likely I will not go," Duritskaya said when asked if she would attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She said she was now staying at a friend's apartment in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Investigators had questioned her several times, gone through her belongings and taken data from her mobile phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She said she was initially questioned for several hours without a lawyer or representative from the Ukrainian Embassy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Nemtsov had criticized Putin's annexation of Crimea and his support for pro-Russian separatists in the east of Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He and Duritskaya had been dating for three years, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The investigators say they are following several lines of inquiry and have come up with a number of possible motives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>One is that Nemtsov may have been the victim of a jealous former lover, a version Duritskaya ruled out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I don't think anything. I cannot think at the moment. I don't know who did it," she said.</td></tr>
