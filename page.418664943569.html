<h3>Greece crisis: banks reopen after three weeks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greeks queued outside banks on Monday as they reopened three weeks after closing to stop the system collapsing under a flood of withdrawals, the first cautious sign of a return to normal after a deal to start talks on a new package of bail-out reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Limits on cash withdrawals have been made slightly more flexible, with a weekly limit of &#x20ac;420 in place of the daily &#x20ac;60 limit previously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Capital controls and restrictions on withdrawals will remain in place but we are entering a new stage which we all hope will be one of normality," said Louka Katseli, head of the Greek bank association.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greeks will be able to deposit cheques but not cash, pay bills as well as have access to safety deposit boxes and withdraw money without an ATM card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bankers said there may be minor disruptions after the three-week interruption to services but they expected services to resume largely as normal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I don't expect major problems, our network and the network of our competitors are ready to serve our clients," said a senior official at Piraeus Bank, one of the big four lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"There might be lines because many people will want to withdraw money from their deposit boxes," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The bank closures were the most visible sign of the crisis that took Greece to the brink of falling out of the euro earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Mr Tsipras is eyeing a fresh start and swift talks on the bail-out that will keep Greece afloat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A man cleans the pavement in front a closed Attica Bank branch in Athens on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The tough terms of the bail-out will see tax hikes, pension cuts, strict curbs on public spending, an overhaul of collective bargaining rules and a transfer of &#x20ac;50 billion of state assets into a special privatisation fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In exchange, Greece is hoping to receive loans of up to &#x20ac;86 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The decision to reopen banks was the first action by Greece's new cabinet after the 40-year-old leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras sacked rebels who had opposed the deal he struck with EU leaders last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Increases in value added tax agreed under the bail-out terms have also taken effect with VAT on food and public transport jumping to 23 per cent from 13 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Acceptance of the bail-out terms that meant the banks could reopen marked a turnaround for Mr Tsipras after months of difficult talks and a referendum that rejected a less stringent deal proposed by the lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He sacked party rebels in a government reshuffle on Friday and is seeking a swift start to talks on the bail-out accord with European partners and the IMF before elections which Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis said were likely in September or October.</td></tr>
