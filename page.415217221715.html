<h3>US clears officer in Ferguson case, criticizes police force</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ST. LOUIS (AP) " The federal government's withering report on the Ferguson Police Department issued a stern mandate to city leaders: Reform your law-enforcement practices and rebuild relations with the black community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It won't be swift or simple, particularly if the same police chief is in charge and many of the same officers are on the beat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some residents and civic leaders want to see wholesale changes in leadership or even complete dissolution of the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At the very least, experts said Thursday, Ferguson must move quickly, and publicly, to prove it is serious about regaining public trust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Justice Department on Wednesday cleared Darren Wilson, the white former Ferguson officer who shot Michael Brown, of federal civil rights charges in the death of the 18-year-old, who was black and unarmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But a separate report released simultaneously found patterns of racial profiling, bigotry and profit-driven law enforcement and court practices in the St. Louis County suburb that has come to represent the tension between minorities and American police nationwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Most of Ferguson's police officers and city leaders are white, but two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Meanwhile, attorneys for Brown's parents on Thursday announced plans for a wrongful-death lawsuit against the city and Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They did not say specifically when the complaint would be filed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Brown's parents attended the news conference announcing the case but did not speak or take questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Attorney Anthony Gray said the lawsuit will offer a "more accurate picture" of the fatal confrontation between Brown and the officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He had other options to him," Gray said of Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"He chose deadly force as his option."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gray called that choice "unreasonable and unnecessary."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Justice Department found that black drivers were more than twice as likely as others to be searched during routine traffic stops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Minority residents bear the burden of fines and court costs expected to generate $3 million this fiscal year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Black residents were more likely to face excessive force from police, often during unwarranted stops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Police Chief Tom Jackson, in a reply to a texted interview request, said only, "I'm still looking into this report."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Messages seeking comment from Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and attorneys for Wilson were not returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The report also included seven racially tinged emails that did not result in punishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Knowles said Wednesday that three employees were responsible for those emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>One was fired Wednesday, and the other two are on administrative leave pending an investigation, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The report spurred calls from some for St. Louis County or another municipality to take over the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Others urged Jackson to resign, or for the city to fire him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The chief has no credibility," said state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, a Democrat who represents Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"How in the world did the chief of police not know that there was an undercurrent of racism that existed in his police department?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Other political leaders were more measured in their assessment but still pressed for improvements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Facts exposed in the Department of Justice's report on the Ferguson Police Department are deeply disturbing and demonstrate the urgent need for the reforms I have called for, some of which the General Assembly is now considering, including reforms to municipal courts," Gov. Jay Nixon said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>At a brief news conference Wednesday, the mayor tried to show that Ferguson is serious about reform, saying the city has been working for some time to find more black officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Only four of the current 54 commissioned officers are black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Associated Press Writer Jim Suhr in St. Louis contributed to this report.</td></tr>
