<h3>Asia stocks lifted by Greece deal, China's 4th day of gains</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Michael Pistillo, Jr., left, with Barclays and Tommy Kalikas with Livermore Trading Group follow stock prices at the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, July 13, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>U.S. stocks are opening higher after Greece reached an agreement with its creditors on a new loan package that will help keep the country in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>BEIJING (AP) - Asian stock markets were mostly higher Tuesday after Greece and its European creditors agreed on a bailout and Chinese shares rose for a fourth day following a massive government intervention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>KEEPING SCORE: Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 1.4 percent to 20,379.67 and the Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.6 percent at 3,994.58.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 added 1.7 percent to 5,565.20 and New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore, Manila and Jakarta also rose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hong Kong's Hang Send was down 0.7 percent at 25,045.75.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Seoul's Kospi was little changed at 2,062.71.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>GREECE RESPITE: Greece struck a preliminary rescue deal with other European Union governments that should avert an imminent financial catastrophe but guarantees years more hardship for its people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The agreement removes the immediate threat Greece would default on its debts and leave the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But in exchange for a three-year loan program, the Greek prime minister has to persuade skeptical legislators to pass tax increases and other key demands into law by Wednesday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>ANALYST'S TAKE: "Whether Greece has walked the plank to an economic and political collapse is still unknown," said Bernard Aw of IG Markets in a report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"While the agreement is definitely very positive for market sentiments, as the prospects of Grexit have significantly reduced, this does not mean the odds are eliminated in the medium term. Firstly, Greek lawmakers still need to pass the measures agreed upon into legislation. Secondly, political instability may surface if Tsipras loses his majority and a unity government is required. We would see a difficult road ahead. For now, calmer waters."</td></tr>
