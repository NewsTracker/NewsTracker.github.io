<tr><td>12</td><td>The shooting led to a national "Black Lives Matter" movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Protests escalated again in March after release of two U.S. Department of Justice reports, one of which cleared Wilson of criminal wrongdoing, echoing a decision in November by a St. Louis County grand jury.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>The St. Louis County officer was shot in the shoulder and is back on duty, though he isn't expected to resume full duties until August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Audio of jail telephone calls from the St. Louis County Justice Center obtained by The Associated Press included one call in which Williams said he was having trouble with a group of people, prompting an exchange of gunfire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It wasn't clear to whom he was speaking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Nobody aiming at no police," Williams says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I ran up the hill and he (an unidentified person) shot at the car. ... I shot back," Williams said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In another conversation, Williams expressed concern about a possible lengthy prison sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, has countered that his client has told him he never shot a weapon that day.</td></tr>
