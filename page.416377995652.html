<h3>Netanyahu receives two-week extension to form government</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party came out on top in the March 17 election, winning 30 of parliament's 120 seats and defeating its main rival, the center-left Zionist Union led by Isaac Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Likud has been negotiating with far-right and ultra-Orthodox parties, and with a centrist faction, to form what would be the most right-wing administration in Israel's history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It would control 67 parliamentary seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We made progress and we are on the way to forming a government, but I need additional time for it to be stable and to reach agreements on important issues that will help us meet all the challenges facing Israel," Netanyahu said during a meeting with President Reuven Rivlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rivlin granted him the 14-day extension, as expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The request was not unusual in a country where no one party has ever won an outright majority in a parliamentary election and negotiations among potential political partners over cabinet posts and policy have often gone down to the wire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Netanyahu has largely kept a lid on details of the talks, focusing instead in his public remarks on Israel's opposition to a framework nuclear deal that its main ally, the United States, and five other world powers reached with Iran on April 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Political commentators have cited the allocation of cabinet portfolios as the main sticking point in the coalition negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Their slow pace has raised speculation that Netanyahu, who would serve a fourth term as prime minister, could opt for a broader coalition with Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Herzog has largely dismissed that possibility, insisting that Zionist Union was keen to embrace a role as opposition leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If Netanyahu fails to win the support of at least 61 legislators in the next two weeks - a scenario political commentators see as unlikely - Rivlin can ask another member of parliament to try to put together a government.</td></tr>
