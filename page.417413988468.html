<h3>FIFA boss Sepp Blatter 'to face Swiss prosecutors' over World Cup votes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sepp Blatter is set to be interviewed by Swiss prosecutors who are investigating whether FIFA officials accepted bribes to award the World Cup to Russia and Qatar, it was reported today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The scandal-hit football boss will apparently be designated as a 'person providing information', and will face questioning along with other senior figures such as Michel Platini.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A former top prosecutor in the UK predicted today that Mr Blatter would also be interviewed by the FBI and could be arrested and potentially imprisoned, in the latest blow to his authority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The 79-year-old was re-elected as FIFA president on Friday - just two days after 14 officials were arrested as part of an American-led probe into allegations of massive corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Two British banks are believed to have launched internal investigations into whether officials used them to funnel corrupt payments, after they were named in the FBI report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Blatter has not been accused of wrongdoing, and insisted this week that he had no idea about the alleged bribe-taking at the heart of FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the wake of the US arrests, which took place in Zurich on Wednesday morning, Swiss authorities revealed they were investigating the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Officials told Mr Blatter not to leave Switzerland so they could interview him, and it has now emerged that he will soon be questioned by local police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Sunday Times reported today that he is one of 10 'auskungtspersonen' - a status in Swiss law somewhere between a witness and a suspect - who sit on the FIFA executive council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The others include UEFA president Michel Platini, who has been an outspoken critic of Mr Blatter, and Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Labour leadership frontrunner Andy Burnham today called for England to boycott the next World Cup, which is set to be held in Russia in 2018.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The MP for Leigh suggested that the FA should 'take a stand' by refusing to participate in the contest due to the corruption allegations swirling around FIFA and Vladimir Putin's aggression towards Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Speaking to John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 Live this morning, Mr Burnham - a passionate Everton fan - said that he 'can't see how it feels right' to take part in the World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'I've long had my doubts about Russia holding the next World Cup,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'I voiced those doubts when the situation developed in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I said that I couldn't see how the whole world could just go to Russia as if nothing had happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>FA chairman Greg Dyke said it would be 'ridiculous' for England to boycott the World Cup unilaterally, but suggested that the country could join a Europe-wide protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But Mr Burnham said: 'I think maybe they should just be a bit stronger, personally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>I think they should say what I think many people feel - it's just not acceptable, particularly when you look at both of these situations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The would-be leader added that it was too early to take a stand over the 2022 World Cup, set to be held in Qatar, arguing that it was necessary to deal with the situation in Russia first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Swiss probe, known as 'Operation Darwin', is questioning all members of the executive council who were involved in the 2010 vote which gave the 2018 cup to Russia and the 2022 version to Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Blatter has not been named as suspect in the parallel US investigation into corruption allegations - but today a former Director of Public Prosecutions predicted that he would be embroiled in the probe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Lord Macdonald, who was the UK's top prosecutor between 2003 and 2008, said that the FIFA boss had 'presided over this swamp for decades' and would inevitably come under new scrutiny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered were all named in the FBI indictment over claims that corrupt FIFA employees used accounts with the banks to transfer corrupt payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It emerged today that Barclays and Standard Chartered were launching internal reviews into the allegations, as the Serious Fraud Office continues to monitor the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Despite the twin probes which were unveiled this week, Mr Blatter won a fifth term as president by a majority of nearly two-thirds, and promptly hit out at his rivals while vowing to rid FIFA of suspicion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He blamed the British media and US authorities for organising a vendetta against him and denied that FIFA is in crisis over the graft allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Culture Secretary John Whittingdale today warned that the England team may have to consider boycotting future World Cups if the organisation does not change its ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He wrote in the Sunday Times: 'Michel Platini has talked of European nations boycotting future World Cups if Blatter refuses to stand down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Tory Cabinet minister added: 'While none of us wants to see things go that far, Platini's dramatic decision to raise the nuclear option of a boycott underlines the sheer scale of this scandal and the lamentable failure of Fifa's leadership to deal with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>'One of the few certainties is that the era of bribery and backhanders must end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Fifa must finally begin to act, in the words of its much-derided motto, "for the good of the game".</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Greg Dyke, chairman of the FA, suggested this morning that it would be 'ridiculous' to boycott the competition unilaterally, but added that the national team would consider taking part in a wider action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: 'It would be ridiculous to try and do it on your own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>All we would do is pull out of the World Cup and everyone would say "well done" and forget all about us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Mr Platini was the first to threaten a World Cup boycott, ahead of a UEFA meeting next week where European football giants will debate how to respond to the FIFA scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The president of the South African Football Association has confirmed the country's World Cup bid committee handed over $10million ( 6.5million) after winning the rights to the 2010 competition - but insisted this was not a bribe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>This is the first time that South Africa has admitted paying money to the football association run by former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, the man at the centre of the bribery claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Warner is one of the officials arrested and indicted this week by the FBI in connection with alleged corruption and bribery at Fifa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The admission by SAFA boss Danny Jordaan follows a week of denials from local football authorities and the government over claims that South Africa had paid a $10million bribe to secure the hosting of the 2010 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Mr Jordaan, who was head of the local organising committee, said that the $10million was paid to the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf) in 2008 as South Africa's contribution towards their football development fund.</td></tr>

<tr><td>44</td><td>South Africa is said to have promised to pay Warner $10million for his support for the 2010 bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>After South Africa won the vote' football officials allegedly said it was not possible to pay him out of South African government funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Instead' the money was deducted directly from a payment FIFA made to South Africa to help finance the hosting of the tournament, thereby concealing the alleged bribe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Of the $100million which FIFA agreed to pay SAFA for hosting the 2010 World Cup, the Sunday Independent newspaper reported that SAFA only received $80million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The paper claimed that no other football association received a cash injection comparable to the payment from SAFA to Concacaf during 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>A SAFA official said that Concacaf was given the money because 'it regarded itself as part of the African diaspora'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>A British official who was thrown out of FIFA after he spoke out against corruption has compared the global football organisers to a 'mafia family'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>John McBeth, former head of the Scottish Football Association, lost his post as FIFA vice-president in 2007 when he claimed that officials from Africa and the Caribbean were corrupt, prompting allegations of racism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>One of the officials who criticised him at the time was Jack Warner, the disgraced Trinidad & Tobago football boss who this week was pictured dancing hours after he was released from police custody on health grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Mr McBeth, 71, said today that he was vindicated by the revelations of the new corruption probe and called for a thorough overhall of FIFA's standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>'Blatter loves to talk about "la familia", the football family,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>'But in reality Fifa is a mafia family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>'I've always said he will either die as president or go to prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The cupboards are full of skeletons and unless Blatter can bring in a successor to keep them hidden, he has a problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>The Scottish official added: 'There's a number of factors which have contributed to corruption being allowed to fester.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>'They travel the world first-class.</td></tr>
