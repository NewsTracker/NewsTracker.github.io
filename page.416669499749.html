<tr><td>7</td><td>GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) - At least seven people died as flames and gunfire erupted around the western Mexico state of Jalisco on Friday when a military operation targeting a violent drug cartel was launched at the start of a three-day holiday weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Suspected cartel members stopped buses and trucks to block key highways in the state capital of Guadalajara and other cities, snarling traffic on a day Mexicans took to the road in droves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gunmen fired on a military helicopter, killing three soldiers and forcing it to make an emergency landing about 150 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Guadalajara.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ten soldiers and two federal police officers were injured and three soldiers remained missing, a defense ministry statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The statement said the helicopter was participating in the anti-cartel offensive known as Operation Jalisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Jalisco Gov. Aristoteles Sandoval said at an afternoon news conference that the violence around the state was a reaction to the operation, which he said was designed to "get to the bottom of and to be able to arrest all the leaders of this cartel, of this organization."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Sandoval did not name the cartel, but authorities have been locked in an increasingly bloody battle with the Jalisco New Generation cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Last month, cartel gunmen killed 15 state police officers in an ambush that was the bloodiest single attack on Mexican authorities in recent memory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>One week earlier, cartel gunmen attempted to assassinate the state security commissioner and on March 19 they killed five federal police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Authorities have said those attacks were revenge for state forces killing a cartel leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On Friday, Sandoval said Operation Jalisco, which had been announced by federal authorities earlier in the day, had the goal of arresting all members of the cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Sandoval said there were a total of seven deaths Friday, but did not specify the circumstances or the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Later, state spokesman Gonzalo Sanchez said through his Twitter account that the dead included three soldiers, one state police officer, two suspected criminals and one civilian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In an interview with the newspaper El Universal, Sanchez said authorities believed the Jalisco New Generation cartel was responsible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The governor counted 29 road blockades around the state affecting 19 municipalities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He said 11 banks and five gas stations had been attacked and the state remained under a "code red" protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Fifteen people had been arrested and there were four armed confrontations, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Alejandro Hope, a former official with Mexico's intelligence service, said the violent response to the government offensive showed the cartel is cohesive and capable of reacting to attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He said the gang would likely tighten security to fend off the capture of its leader, who is believed to be Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, nicknamed "El Mencho."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Hope questioned the decision to go after the cartel's top leadership before first taking out mid-level leaders and weakening the gang's ability to react with coordinated violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>However, Jorge Chabat, another Mexican security expert, said he didn't think the cartel's response would have a big impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I don't believe that it is going to make the federal government leave them alone," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>President Enrique Pena Nieto said Friday through his Twitter account that he lamented the soldiers' deaths in the course of their work in Jalisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In December, Pena Nieto said Jalisco was considered one of the most unstable states in terms of security, along with Tamaulipas, Guerrero and Michoacan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He said then that those states would be prioritized in anti-crime efforts, but the violence there has continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The U.S. consulate in Guadalajara issued an advisory warning U.S. citizens to avoid travelling in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Earlier, the Jalisco state prosecutor's office used its Twitter account to urge people in Guadalajara to remain calm as authorities responded to the road blockades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>It said officials also were coordinating to extinguish fires and regain calm in other parts of the state's interior.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In recent weeks, burning vehicles and blockades in the state of Tamaulipas along the Texas border were attributed to factions of the Gulf cartel following the capture of some local leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But there have not been so many blockades erected simultaneously across so many parts of a state in recent memory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Associated Press writer Elizabeth Rivera reported this story in Guadalajara and Christopher Sherman reported from Mexico City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Associated Press writer E.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Eduardo Castillo in Mexico City contributed to this report.</td></tr>
