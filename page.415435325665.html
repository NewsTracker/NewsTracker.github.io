<tr><td>3</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - It's a bird.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It's a plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Actually, it was a balloon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the crash of one of Google's "Loon" balloons for relaying Internet service was enough to have security forces summoned to a mountain township in central Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Reports first of a plane crash, then of a skydiver plummeting to earth sent soldiers, state police and civil defense workers swarming into the remote area Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They found one of the huge, jellyfish-shaped balloons that Google is using to carry antennas to deliver online access in remote areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Originally residents said an aircraft had fallen, and later, because of the balloon's shape, they said it was a parachute," said Manuel Escalera, spokesman for the civil defense agency in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The state government said in a statement that the balloon "caused surprise among inhabitants because of the sound it made when it fell."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Escalera said no one was hurt because the equipment came down in an unpopulated area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Veracruz authorities have notified Google to come pick up the remains of the balloon and the transmission equipment.</td></tr>
