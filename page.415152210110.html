<tr><td>3</td><td>The arrest of Farabi Shafiur Rahman came four days after attackers wielding meat cleavers killed Avijit Roy, an outspoken atheist and critic of the intertwining of religion and politics, on a crowded sidewalk in the capital, said Mufti Mahmud Khan, a spokesman for the anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Roy, a Bangladesh-born engineer with American citizenship, was killed on a visit from Georgia in the United States to attend Dhaka's main book fair.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>Ahmed was seriously injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rahman, a Muslim blogger who denounced atheism, had threatened Roy in Facebook postings, Khan said, quoting him as writing: "Avijit Roy lives in America, so it's not possible to kill him right now. But he will be killed when he comes back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Rahman had been arrested previously for threatening an imam who performed funeral prayers for another atheist Bangladeshi blogger killed in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He was released on bail after six months in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While Rahman acknowledged making the threats, Khan said, authorities refused to say if they believed he was one of the attackers.</td></tr>
