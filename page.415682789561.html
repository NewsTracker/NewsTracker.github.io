<h3>Robert Durst denied bail, called flight risk by judge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The deranged 71-year-old heir of the wealthy New York real estate family will be held on weapons charges as authorities arrange his extradition to Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On March 14 he was arrested in the Big Easy for the murder of his confidante, Susan Berman, in California in 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He has been held in a prison's mental health unit for nearly a week because he is a suicide risk, officials say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>During the bail hearing before Magistrate Harry Cantrell, Durst sat beside his lawyers with his hands shackled to his sides in padded handcuffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said the hearing had gone as he expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We will not contest bail until we get to California. That's where we want to be," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>DeGuerin signaled he plans to argue his client was railroaded due to media attention surrounding the HBO miniseries, "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The attorney singled out prosecutor-turned-TV-host Jeanine Pirro, who featured prominently in the show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"She's here because she's been participating in the dogging of Mr. Durst for years," DeGuerin said, asking a judge to remove her from the courtroom because she is a potential witness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>DeGuerin said he wanted to question Pirro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But after a brief recess Cantrell ruled that Pirro would not testify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The documentary series revisited the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Durst's first wife in 1982, Berman's murder and Durst's dismemberment of his 71-year-old neighbor in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Durst was acquitted of murdering the neighbor, whose body parts were found floating in Galveston Bay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Durst's March 14 arrest in New Orleans Berman's shooting death came one day before the show's finale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The jaw-dropping conclusion featured Durst mumbling to himself in a bathroom that he "killed them all, of course" on a hot mic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Durst was arrested March 14 at the J.W. Marriott Hotel.</td></tr>
