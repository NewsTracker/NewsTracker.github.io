<h3>Candidate's comparison of Fort Wayne to Ferguson draws heat</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"My whole intent was to show dissatisfaction with the city administration and how they dealt with a single situation," candidate Richard Stevenson said in a telephone interview Wednesday, a day after meeting with a group of police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I apologized to officers if anything was misconstrued that I'm against the police department."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Stevenson, the Wayne Township trustee who's challenging incumbent Mayor Tom Henry in the Democratic primary, cited the 2007 shooting of a motorist by a white police officer in declaring "there is a lot of similarity between Fort Wayne and Ferguson" during a candidates' forum Saturday at the Fort Wayne Urban League.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The Fort Wayne Police Department needs some direction. They need to be cleaned up," Stevenson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"How do you kill a person like that and send him back out to beat up somebody else."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He was referring to the 2007 shooting of Baudilio Lemus-Rodriguez by white officer James Arnold after Lemus-Rodriguez had been stopped for a traffic violation and then tried to ram officers with his car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A private consultant hired by the city to review the case ruled the shooting "objectively reasonable," and Arnold was allowed to remain on duty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Five years later, Arnold was suspended for 30 days for using excessive force in a different case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jon Bonar, president of the 370-member Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said a group of officers met with Stevenson on Tuesday and replayed the video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"He didn't recant or apologize. Comparing us to Ferguson is ridiculous," Bonar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's not a good thing to say. There's no merit behind it and I think it's going to have some ramifications for him in terms of the election," Bonar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Quite frankly, if it was on the ballot between him and a can of peaches, I'll vote for the can of peaches."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>City Safety Director Rusty York, Fort Wayne's former police chief, called any comparison between Fort Wayne and Ferguson "reckless and unfortunate."</td></tr>
