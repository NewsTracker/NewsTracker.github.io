<h3>Remains in Madrid are believed to be those of Cervantes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MADRID - In a discovery that could create a new venue for literary pilgrims, Spanish investigators said Tuesday that they might have located part of the remains of Cervantes, whose novel "Don Quixote" has enthralled readers over centuries with stories of its eponymous knight and his servant, Sancho Panza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cervantes, often lauded as having written the first modern novel, died in 1616 after requesting burial in a convent in Madrid where, for almost a year, investigators have been searching the subsoil for bones that they now believe to include some of the author's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Everything coincides to lead us to believe that Cervantes is there," a forensics expert, Francisco Etxeberria, said at a news conference in Madrid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The investigators cautioned, however, that it may be impossible to guarantee that the bones are those of the writer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Almudena Garcia, an archaeologist, said that there was "no confirmed genetic identification," although DNA tests were being performed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The whereabouts of Cervantes's tomb had been a mystery since the Convent of the Discalced Trinitarians was rebuilt in the late 17th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The remains were finally found below the ground of the crypt of the church, at a depth of about 50 inches in a box that contained bones from 10 adults and five children, according to Fernando de Prato, a historian who led the search for Cervantes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It would of course have been better to find his remains complete," to establish the identity of Cervantes with certainty, de Prato said, "but I still have the feeling today of having reached the end of a journey."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Cervantes is most often remembered for "Don Quixote," which gave the world the word quixotic in acknowledgment of its central character and his adventures, including his joust with windmills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Authorities in Madrid are hoping to build a monument within the church to commemorate the writer, with the goal of completing that work by April of next year, the 400th anniversary of his death.</td></tr>
