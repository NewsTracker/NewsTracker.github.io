<h3>Labor officials: New Mexico, West Texas workers underpaid</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Federal labor officials say oil and natural gas workers in New Mexico and West Texas have been underpaid by more than $1.3 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The U.S. Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division made the announcement Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The findings stem from an enforcement initiative launched by the division last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Officials say overtime violations led to the underpayment to some 1,300 workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Among the problems found, employers were failing to include bonus payments when calculating overtime rates, weren't paying for time spent working off-the-clock and paying flat rates despite the hours worked by employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There were also instances of workers being misclassified as independent contractors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A regional labor official, Cynthia Watson, says there's a misconception that because oil and gas workers typically earn more than minimum wage that they're being paid legally.</td></tr>
