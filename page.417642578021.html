<h3>Mexican Soccer probes coach, 2 players over partisan tweets</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - The Mexican Soccer Federation is investigating national team coach Miguel Herrera and two players over politically tinged tweets sent the day of the country's recent elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The federation said in a statement issued Monday night that it will evaluate whether Herrera, striker Oribe Peralta and midfielder Marco Fabian violated its code of ethics, which calls for "maintaining a neutral position on matters of a religious or political nature."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Local media reported that they face possible fines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Herrera, affectionately known by his nickname, "the Louse," is famous for his exuberant sideline displays during last year's World Cup in Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But he drew a backlash for tweets backing the Green Party, which ran a slick advertising blitz and was fined millions of dollars for violating campaign laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Don't forget to vote, let's go with the Greens," and "The Greens fulfill" their promises, Herrera said Sunday on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Green is traditionally the Mexican national team's color, but the "The Greens Fulfill" was a party campaign slogan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Electoral law forbids campaigning by parties on election day, but Green Party officials said they had nothing to do with Herrera's tweets or a series of very similar messages sent by a variety of television and music stars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Herrera was defensive about the tweets at a news conference Sunday, after the national team lost 2-0 in a friendly match with Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I'm a human being, I'm a normal Mexican citizen, with statements that I can make in social media," Herrera said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's simply a personal situation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Peralta, who plays professionally for Club America of Mexico City, sent tweets urging Mexicans to vote using a hash tag that translates as "WearGreen" and was used by others to promote the party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I want a #GreenMexico!" he tweeted Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Fabian, of Guadalajara's Chivas, retweeted Herrera and also posted one of his own using the "WearGreen" tag.</td></tr>
