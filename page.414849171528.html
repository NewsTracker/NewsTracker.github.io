<h3>China holiday makes business, cultural waves around world</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Decades ago the Chinese New Year holiday, also known as Spring Festival, had little impact outside of China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But as the country has gained outsized economic influence, the holiday, which has enormous cultural significance in the Chinese-speaking world, has become more prominent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>HONG KONG (AP) - Decades ago the Chinese New Year holiday, also known as Spring Festival, had little impact outside of China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But as the country gained outsized economic influence, the holiday, which has enormous cultural significance in the Chinese-speaking world, has become more prominent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This is how it ripples around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chinese factories shut down for the holiday and then some, with hundreds of millions of migrant workers heading to their hometowns, part of the world's largest mass movement of people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the lead up to the holiday, factories run flat out to fill orders before shutting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The holiday itself runs from Feb. 18 to 24 this year, but workers start setting off as much as two weeks earlier on packed trains and buses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After the holiday they may take the same amount of time to return, or not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The holiday is a prime occasion to switch jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It all means an annual headache for retailers and importers overseas who rely on China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Shipping companies warn customers that China's transport and logistics networks are at capacity and their shipments must be at ports two weeks ahead of the holiday to stand a chance of getting on a boat before the country shuts down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This year, shipping delays are compounded by a slowdown at U.S. West Coast ports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Stock market trading shudders to a halt as mainland China shuts for an entire week and financial hubs such as Hong Kong and Singapore take a break as well, albeit shorter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Numerous other countries including South Korea and Vietnam also observe Lunar New Year holidays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Muslim majority Malaysia and Indonesia, with large Chinese minorities, take holidays too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Trading volumes "drop off considerably" about three working days before the start of the holiday, said Andrew Sullivan, managing director at Haitong Securities in Hong Kong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>This year, Friday was "the last day that you can sell in Hong Kong and get your money before Chinese New Year" under trading settlement rules, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Foreign investors also tend to wind down trading in Asia as the holiday nears, Sullivan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The festival is traditionally the most important time of the year for family reunions, but as China has become prosperous, an increasing number of wealthy Chinese are opting to travel abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That translates into big business for global luxury brands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Many British department stores, for example, are pulling out all the stops to woo mainland Chinese shoppers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>(Designer handbags, watches and jewelry can be up to 30 percent cheaper in Europe because of high luxury taxes in China.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Harrods is selling its own brand of red envelopes traditionally used to give "lai see," or lucky money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Selfridges and luxury brand Burberry are each offering cards and envelopes personalized with Chinese calligraphy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Designer label Vivienne Westwood has launched a collectors' necklace featuring a sheep pendant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Shoppers at Fortnum & Mason paying with UnionPay cards - China's homegrown payment network - will get bonus gifts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Chinese spending in Britain last February jumped 23 percent over the same month in 2012, said Gordon Clark, manager at Global Blue, a Switzerland-based firm that tracks luxury retail spending worldwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Chinese shoppers spend an average 739 pounds ($1,137) per transaction in Britain each February, mostly on luxury jewelry, watches and designer clothes.</td></tr>

<h3>Al-Qaeda-linked militants kill four police officers in Tunisia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It was the first deadly assault this year on government forces in Tunisia, where the police and the army have been hunting down jihadists blamed for a string of attacks on security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"A group of 20 terrorists attacked a patrol of the National Guard" early on Wednesday, two kilometres from Kasserine, which lies at the foot of Mount Chaambi, said interior ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The gunmen opened fire at a police car, killing the four policemen, and fled with their weapons, the spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Aroui said the attackers were members of the al-Qaeda-linked Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade, the main Tunisian armed group active along the border with Algeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There will be a severe and violent response," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the assault, but a Twitter account close to Okba Ibn Nafaa praised the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"God be praised, a patrol of the pagan [police] was attacked near Mount Chaambi and four [policemen] killed," the account said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tunisia has seen a rise in Islamist extremism since the 2011 revolution that ousted veteran strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Dozens of police and military personnel have been killed or wounded in attacks blamed on Islamist militants around the Chaambi range, but also further north along the border with Algeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Prime Minister Habib Essid, who heads a coalition government that includes moderate Islamists, has said his cabinet's priority would be to restore security and "battle against terrorism".</td></tr>
