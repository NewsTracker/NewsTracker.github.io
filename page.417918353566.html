<h3>Greece Pledges New Proposal To Resolve Debt Crisis</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Greek minister is hinting that Athens will bring a new plan to the table at an emergency European Union summit next week to keep the country from defaulting on its sovereign debt and exiting the Eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We will try to supplement our proposal so that we get closer to a solution," State Minister Alekos Flabouraris told Greek Mega television in a morning news show, according to Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We are not going there with the old proposal. Some work is being done to see where we can converge, so that we achieve a mutually beneficial solution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The European Central Bank gave Greece more than $2 billion on Friday to prop up the country's banking system and to stave off a collapse as fearful Greeks withdrew more than $1 billion in a single day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>According to The Guardian: "If Greece does not receive a fresh bailout from its creditors by 30 June, it will be unable to meet the next repayment of 1.6bn ($1.8 billion) to the International Monetary Fund and could be turfed out of the single currency completely."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel "has warned there must be a deal between Greece and its creditors ahead of Monday's summit. Otherwise, she said, the summit would not be able to make any decision," the BBC writes.</td></tr>
