<h3>Initial Ebola test on Liberia dog carcass negative: sources</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DAKAR A dead dog suspected of being the possible source for the re-emergence of Ebola in Liberia has tested negative for the disease, two health officials said on Tuesday, quoting initial findings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Residents say that Liberia's first victim of the virus since the country was declared Ebola-free in early May had shared a dog meat meal with residents shortly before he died on June 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Researchers have since retrieved the carcass of the dog from the village of Nedowein in Margibi County and tested the remains for Ebola, the sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I learned today the result was negative, but we have to be careful because the remains are in bad condition and the test is designed for humans," said a health official in Liberia who asked for anonymity since research is ongoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The deputy head of Liberia's Ebola response team, Francis Ketteh, could not immediately confirm the findings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Even if that dog had anything, finding it now will be difficult because of the time lapse. We are trying to do everything to find the source," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is the largest on record and has killed more than 11,200 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Liberia was seen as a success story when, with neighbors Guinea and Sierra Leone still struggling to end the outbreak, it was declared free of the virus on May 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Experts are baffled by the reappearance of the hemorrhagic fever, especially since the first victim, a 17-year-old boy named Abraham Memaigar, lived far from the borders and had no known history of visiting infected areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Liberia has since reported a further two cases linked to the first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Both have been hospitalized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tracing the origins of the virus is seen as important since it will offer clues on preparing for future outbreaks in a region where some scientists think the virus is endemic, possibly living on in animal hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Like humans, monkeys and pigs are known to be able to carry Ebola, although there has never been proof that dogs can.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>However, a 2005 study showed that dogs in areas of Gabon affected by past Ebola outbreaks had antibodies against it, suggesting they might be survivors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Another possible explanation for Memaigar's infection is that the virus never disappeared and continued to affect populations in remote areas of the country.</td></tr>
