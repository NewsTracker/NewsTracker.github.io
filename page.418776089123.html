<h3>Ukraine replaces entire police force to beat corruption</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KIEV, Ukraine -- Only a few months ago, Kiev residents would normally avoid the police if they could help it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The officer would be of no use on a complaint - or worse, would demand a bribe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Not any longer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>These days, Kiev residents approach members of a new police force that has hit the streets - and even ask to take a picture with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's being welcomed as the Ukrainian government's first visible reform since it came to power in February 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the first phase of a comprehensive overhaul, the entire traffic police corps of Kiev was disbanded and replaced on July 4 by a retrained force - with new powers to make arrests as well as issue speeding or parking tickets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The police reform ultimately aims to retrain, and possibly replace, the entire Ukrainian Interior Ministry, including elite inspectors on serious crimes such as murder and corporate fraud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The initiative is supported by the United States and managed by Eka Zguladze, who was in charge of a largely successful police reform in her native Georgia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One of the pledges of the new Kiev government, which took over last year after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych fled the country, was to combat rampant corruption in Ukraine's police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Just as in neighboring Russia, Ukraine's police corps was perceived as chronically extorting bribes and harassing citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The new government decided to start from scratch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The first phase replaced the old traffic police with a new 2,000-strong patrol team trained by Ukrainians who had themselves received instruction from American officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While the traffic police were suspended rather than sacked, it is still not clear whether the old cops will be able to come back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The backbone of the overhaul was a training program this year for 100 Ukrainian police instructors, run by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They went on to teach the new police course in Kiev for the inaugural class of new officers who hit the streets this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>William Brownfield, the U.S. assistant secretary for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, has been advising the Ukrainian government on the police shakeup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He had a scathing assessment of the original state of affairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The conclusion appears to be unanimous that - whatever you may think of the politics, external actors or the economy - the police was not working well," said Brownfield, who has been advising nations on police reform for two decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The reform, to which the United States has contributed $15 million, is expected to take from five to 10 years to complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The creation of the new patrol force in Kiev is still described as an experiment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Other branches of the police in Kiev have not been disbanded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Several other big Ukrainian cities like Mykolaiv and Odessa will get new patrol police in the coming months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Along with the American training, the new officers got American-styled uniforms and are all young and fit, in sharp contrast to their balding pot-bellied predecessors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Good looks sometimes seem like a prerequisite for the job - giving the initiative the air of a publicity stunt, one of the criticisms leveled at the reform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Kateryna Lyshnevska, a 29-year-old who used to run a small business, signed up for the police course and was accepted in what has been described as 10-to-1 competition for the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Lyshnevska said she was attracted by the stable pay, as well as the prospect of being able to help bring long-anticipated reforms to life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I believe in reforms and wanted to help with the reforms to make history in our country," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The new officers' average monthly pay of between 7,000 to 10,000 hryvnias ($320-to-$450) may seem modest but it is still higher than the average Kiev salary of 6,000 hryvnia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Kiev residents routinely stop members of the new police corps and ask for a photo with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>And they seem genuinely surprised at officers lending a hand - without asking for a bribe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>For Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, the first visible outcome of the reform is a four-fold increase in the number of calls that Kiev police have received since the new force was sworn in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"People started to call more often because there is more trust," Avakov wrote recently on Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"And this is a challenge for the new police too: we can't let (people) down."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Avakov admits that a lot of police officers are opposing the reforms but says that the government is determined to press on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"The old system has greeted the creation of the new police with resistance," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"(We will) use our will to convince those who want to keep the old ways."</td></tr>
