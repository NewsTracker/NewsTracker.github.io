<h3>Pressure rises on Greece as savers drain bank deposits</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greek bank deposits dropped by more than 7.5 billion euros ($8.2 billion) in February, ramping up pressure on the country's teetering financial system as its government scrambles to reach a deal with creditors within days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The central bank of Greece said Thursday that private and business deposits dropped to 140.5 billion euros ($154.2 billion) by the end of February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Deposit levels have plummeted by nearly 100 billion euros ($110 billion) since the start of Greek financial crisis in 2010 but had stabilized over the past two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Savers then began to pull money out of their accounts again this year, when the new radical left party won general elections on the promise to take a hard line against creditors' demands for budget austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some feared the clash could push Greece to bankruptcy and even cause it to fall out of the euro, a move that would devastate the country's financial system in the short term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' government is in talks with European creditors on what the reforms should be and has promised to submit a suitable list of measures by early next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The creditors want to approve the changes before releasing the remaining bailout funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greece has its back against a wall as it badly needs money - it faces debt repayments and rollovers of nearly 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in April, mainly in the middle of the month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That sum will rise to about in July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Not being able to raise money on bond markets, Greece depends on bailout creditors for the money to meet those obligations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Economy Minister Giorgos Stathakis said he expects eurozone lenders to grant preliminary approval to the new Greek reforms sometime "early next week."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I think many difficulties have been overcome and that ... the political atmosphere is now excellent," Stathakis told private Antenna television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Tsipras government says its priority is to reform the country's inefficient tax administration, and on Thursday resumed talks with the Swiss government, after a year's interruption, on efforts to crackdown on tax evasion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Jacques de Watteville, Switzerland's state secretary for international financial and taxation, was in Athens to meet senior government officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We had a two and a half-hour discussion about the situation in Greece and international efforts to fight tax crimes," de Watteville told reporters in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Shares on the Athens Stock Exchange closed down 3.74 percent Thursday amid losses across Europe.</td></tr>
