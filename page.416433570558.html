<h3>Google prepares to launch U.S. wireless service as Europe circles the wagons</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Pedestrians walk past Google Inc. signage displayed in front of the company's headquarters in Mountain View.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google is preparing to roll out a new wireless service in partnership with established carriers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hate paying for unused data on your wireless plan?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It won't be long before you can switch to Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google will unveil its new U.S. wireless service as early as Wednesday, allowing customers to pay only for the amount of data they use each month, according to the Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The planned service will be the start of Google as Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It's a strategy that will intrigue consumers looking for a deal on wireless service, and it will give Google an immediate competitive edge in an already crowded marketplace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While the service only works with the Nexus 6 phones (for now), it could quickly affect current wireless service plans of the major carriers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>So how could Google redefine wireless?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Most wireless plans require subscribers to pay for data they never use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The average smartphone user overpays for $28 each month on unused data, according to the Journal, citing data from a 2013 study by wireless research firm Validas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As competition increases, some services are offering alternative data plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Small companies like Republic Wireless offer users the ability to pay for data as they go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>T-Mobile and AT&T allow customers to roll over unused data to the next month, which doesn't make much of a difference to customers who aren't using their full data plan anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Google might appeal to the same users who have already cut the cord on cable, customers who simply don't want to pay for what they don't use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This will force the larger companies to look at how their data plan is structured and change it, accordingly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Google's new service will run on Sprint and T-Mobile networks, switching between the two depending on which one has the strongest signal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The service could also reduce users' bills by routing calls and data through Wi-Fi networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>If consumers see savings by routing calls through available Wi-Fi, expect to see the big carriers adopting the practice soon.</td></tr>
