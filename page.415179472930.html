<h3>No precedent for Netanyahu's contentious speech to Congress</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a speech that stirred political intrigue in two countries, Netanyahu told Congress that negotiations underway between Iran and the U.S. would "all but guarantee" that Tehran will get nuclear weapons, a step that the world must avoid at all costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Given anywhere else, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech Tuesday wouldn't have caused such a ruckus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But a foreign leader denouncing President Barack Obama's policy from within the grand hall of American democracy upended nearly two centuries of tradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A joint meeting of Congress, gathering senators and representatives together in the House chamber, is a ceremony typically bestowed on one or two friendly foreign leaders per year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It looks a lot like a presidential State of the Union address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The speaker embodies his or her nation; the audience of lawmakers represents all Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Unity and shared purpose are the standard themes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Standing ovations are a given.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It establishes there is a strong bond between the two nations," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"In that context, a speech that provokes controversy at home or abroad is problematic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>So leaders speaking against the backdrop of the chamber's 8-foot-tall American flag tend to gloss over national differences and steer clear of internal politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Some of these speeches are powerful - think Winston Churchill rallying Americans for a long, hard war or Nelson Mandela calling them to lead all humanity toward democracy and peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Others, frankly, are so bland they're dull.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's not unusual for staffers and student pages to be sent in to fill the seats of lawmakers who didn't bother showing up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Netanyahu's appearance, in contrast, was so contentious that more than four dozen Democratic lawmakers announced they were staying away in protest, despite the nation's close ties to Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Still, demand for seats in the chamber and visitors' gallery was fierce, and Netanyahu was welcomed with enthusiastic ovations and cheers, especially from Republicans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Netanyahu said he was morally obliged to speak out in hopes of stopping what he called the "bad deal" the U.S. is in the midst of negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Before the address, the White House complained that House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had violated protocol by inviting Netanyahu without first consulting the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Boehner responded that Americans needed to hear Netanyahu's fears that Iran will get nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>History offers scant precedent for Netanyahu's contentious speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The tradition of inviting foreign dignitaries dates to the Marquis de Lafayette, the French hero of the American Revolution, who gave separate speeches to the House and Senate in 1824.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It took another 50 years for the two bodies to come together to hear a foreigner - King Kalakaua, of what was then the Kingdom of Hawaii.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Since World War II, these joint meetings - similar to the "joint sessions" that hear U.S. presidents - have become the favored venue for foreign leaders and dignitaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Usually their appearances get more notice back home than among Americans, which made Netanyahu's address before a cheering Congress just two weeks before he's up for re-election in Israel even more controversial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Israel is one of a few allies that dominate the rostrum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>With Netanyahu's return, it ties Britain and France at eight speeches apiece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In all, 110 foreigners and a handful of Americans - mostly early-Space Age astronauts - have addressed joint meetings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>As Australian prime minister in 2011, Julia Gillard nailed the mutual-admiration genre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Her voice breaking, Gillard recalled being a small girl amazed that Americans had landed on the moon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"On that great day I believed Americans could do anything," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"I believe that still."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The closest comparison to Netanyahu's latest speech to Congress may be Netanyahu's last speech to Congress.</td></tr>
