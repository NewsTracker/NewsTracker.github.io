<h3>More remains found during search at Petit Jean Mountain</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The remains of John Glasgow, who went missing in 2008, have been found in Petit Jean State Park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Conway County Sheriff Mike Smith confirmed that hikers found a skull on Wednesday, March 11, 2015, about 150 yards off Red Bluff Drive in the park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>MORRILTON, Ark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>(AP) - Bone fragments and skeletal remains have been found in a rugged area of Petit Jean Mountain where the skull of missing Little Rock businessman John Glasgow was found earlier this week, according to Arkansas Parks Director Greg Butts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The skull, found Wednesday by hikers, was identified through dental records as being Glasgow, who was 45 when he disappeared in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Butts told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette (http://bit.ly/1EkKhix ) that rain forecast to continue through Sunday morning was hampering efforts and the search would resume Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It has been pouring rain. We're not searching for someone who is injured and needs to be rescued," Butts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It needs to dry out. We will be picking up each leaf and doing a very careful, gentle raking."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The more remains that are found, the better the chance of determining the cause of death, state Crime Laboratory Director Kermit Channel said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We will rely on law enforcement to continue their investigation and search. As they discover additional human remains, they will be submitted to us to examine," Channel said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The remains were found within a mile of where Glasgow's vehicle was last seen parked at the time of his disappearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That mile, however, is "as the crow flies" and includes lengthy, boulder-laden, steep trails, Butts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>When the recovery efforts resume Monday, officials will begin more intensive searching that will include cadaver dogs and metal detectors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We even have an archaeologist that will be coming with the Arkansas State Police," Butts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They will work to determine how far the remains have been distributed and what to look for after so many years have passed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Glasgow, the chief financial officer of CDI Contractors LLC, was last seen leaving his Little Rock home on the morning of Jan. 28, 2008.</td></tr>

<h3>CIA funds found their way into Al Qaeda coffers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But the price was steep - $5 million - and senior security officials were scrambling to come up with the money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They first turned to a secret fund that the CIA bankrolled with monthly cash deliveries to the presidential palace in Kabul, according to several Afghan officials involved in the episode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Afghan government, they said, had already squirreled away about $1 million from that fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Within weeks, that money and $4 million more provided from other countries was handed over to al-Qaida, replenishing its coffers after a relentless CIA campaign of drone strikes in Pakistan had decimated the militant network's upper ranks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"God blessed us with a good amount of money this month," Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, the group's general manager, wrote in a letter to Osama bin Laden in June 2010, noting that the cash would be used for weapons and other operational needs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bin Laden urged caution, fearing the Americans knew about the payment and had laced the cash with radiation or poison, or were tracking it.</td></tr>
