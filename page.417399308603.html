<h3>Blatter Says FIFA Corruption Probe Won't Lead to Him</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Having come through another FIFA election largely unscathed, Sepp Blatter was in a typically defiant mood Saturday when addressing the challenges that still lie ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 79-year-old FIFA president dismissed suggestions that a United States government investigation of corruption in football could lead to his door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Several senior FIFA officials have been arrested already, but Blatter shrugged off the notion that he could be next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Arrested for what? Next question," Blatter said curtly when meeting international media for the first time since American and Swiss federal cases rocked FIFA's home city on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I forgive but I don't forget," Blatter also said at FIFA headquarters, referring to a European-led attempt to oust him after 17 years in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A busy first day of his new four-year presidential term saw the leader of the world's most popular sport scold critics and take acclaim from allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Blatter criticized U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and received a congratulatory telegram from Vladimir Putin, president of 2018 World Cup host Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Gone was the tension which put a tremor in his voice after Swiss police raided FIFA's favorite luxury hotel in Zurich early Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Blatter insisted he had nothing to fear from the U.S. federal case which alleged a $150 million bribe scheme linked to broadcast rights for tournaments in North and South America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Two FIFA vice presidents were among seven men arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I do not see how FIFA could be directly affected by this," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He was equally adamant when responding to questions about whether the probe can't still directly affect him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Was he the "high-ranking FIFA official" mentioned in the Department of Justice indictment who wired $10 million to corrupt North American officials?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The apparent bribes were paid from a FIFA account in exchange for voting for South Africa as the 2010 World Cup host.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Definitely that is not me," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I have no $10 million."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It was clear that, after winning a closer vote than he would have liked Friday, Blatter wanted to come out fighting - first criticizing Lynch in an interview with his local Swiss broadcaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Lynch said Wednesday that FIFA and marketing officials - 14 indicted and four who made guilty pleas - had "corrupted the business of worldwide soccer to serve their interests and to enrich themselves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I was shocked by what she said," Blatter told French-language broadcaster RTS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"As a president I would never make a statement about another organization without knowing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Blatter suggested the U.S. Department of Justice went too far on FIFA's turf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Listen, with all the respect to the judicial system of the U.S. with a new minister of justice," Blatter said, "the Americans, if they have a financial crime that regards American citizens then they must arrest these people there and not in Zurich when we have a congress."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I have especially no concerns about my person," he said about the investigation, which U.S. federal agencies claim is just starting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The seven football officials detained are resisting extradition and face 20 years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Any questioning and plea bargaining could take American authorities deeper into the heart of FIFA.</td></tr>
