<h3>Ebola patient thanks hospital staff</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An Army Reservist who has been discharged from hospital after being successfully treated for Ebola said it was thanks to medical staff that she is alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Corporal Anna Cross, 25, told a press conference at London's Royal Free Hospital that she had been treated by an "absolutely incredible bunch of clinicians".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Thanks to them I'm alive," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Cpl Cross, from Cambridge, also praised the NHS, which she works for, as well as the Army.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cpl Cross is the first person in the world to be treated with the experimental drug MIL 77 after choosing to do so following "careful consideration", the hospital said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She joined the Army Reserves in 2013 as a staff nurse and volunteered to help care for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, arriving there last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She was evacuated back to the UK in an RAF plane on March 12 after becoming the third Briton to test positive for the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cpl Cross said she cried when she found out she was free of the virus and attributed eating strawberries to help her through it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She said it will still take a "long time" before she is fully fit and would "love" to continue volunteering with the military although she suspected she would not be able to return to Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Cpl Cross said she had no idea how she contracted the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An investigation was carried out at the treatment centre but did not find this out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Cpl Cross told the press conference: "I was looked after by the colleagues that I had worked with and that gave me such confidence because they're total professionals and they were really dedicated to getting me home, to getting my health optimised, to get me on the flight, which they did within less than 24 hours of me being diagnosed, and a fantastic RAF team brought me home."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She described the team at the Royal Free as the "best in the world" at treating the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She said that after being diagnosed it "was hard for a few hours and then something in my mind just kicked in as it does in difficult situations and it said 'I have a job to do', which is to get myself back well, and I started to really focus on the people around me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She said this reassured her and she was confident she would get the best possible treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Cpl Cross, who works as an intensive care nurse, said she could not even remember feeling particularly ill but "just felt tired".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She said it was "weird" being treated at the same place she had worked in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I had treated a patient that was in the facility, and then the next day I was sat with them," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"It was nice in a sense because I felt like we were having the same experience and we were both being treated to the same standard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It was odd because I had seen patients who got really sick and had died but he was doing really well, which was encouraging for me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Cpl Cross said all she wanted to do now were "normal things" such as eating food and watching TV and joked that she was grateful for the long career of David Attenborough, whose documentaries she has been watching while in hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She said had lost 10kg (1.5 stone) during the illness but attributed her recovery to her high level of fitness due to be in the military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>She added that her family were "thrilled" at her recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Nurses Pauline Cafferkey and Will Pooley - the only other Britons to have tested positive for the disease - were also treated at the Royal Free and both made full recoveries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Infectious diseases specialist Dr Michael Jacobs said he was "absolutely thrilled" to announce that Cpl Cross was Ebola-free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He said it was impossible to say on the basis of treating one patient whether MIL 77 would work as well with others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"But what I can tell you is that the treatment went very well," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"It caused no side effects that we were able to illicit and we were very happy with its use."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He said it was "close relative" of ZMapp, which was used to treat Mr Pooley, and also an antibody combination given by intravenous infusion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>It was produced by a company in China which "very kindly" provided the drug and there was a "limited supply" left that they could treat future potential patients with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "People that volunteer in Sierra Leone show remarkable courage and it is fantastic to hear Corporal Cross has made a full recovery from Ebola. I am incredibly proud of the staff at the Royal Free Hospital for their tireless work in helping Corporal Cross return home."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies said: "It is wonderful to hear that Corporal Cross has recovered from Ebola. This is thanks to the world class care she received at the Royal Free and I want to thank them for their incredible work. I am grateful for Corporal Cross' bravery and all those who have selflessly helped out with the crisis in Sierra Leone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Minister for the Armed Forces Mark Francois said: "I am delighted that Corporal Cross has made a full recovery and has now been discharged from the Royal Free Hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"I sincerely thank the military medics from 22 Field Hospital who initially treated her in country, the RAF team who got her back to the UK so swiftly and of course, the staff at the Royal Free who treated her so skilfully back to health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Corporal Cross was providing vital support to help combat the spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone, and her 300 other colleagues in country who continue that great effort - we are proud of them all."</td></tr>
