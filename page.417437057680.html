<h3>$100,000 check awaits mystery recycler of rare Apple 1 computer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>$100,000 check awaits mystery recycler of rare Apple 1 computer Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A $100,000 check is waiting for a mystery woman who donated a rare Apple 1 computer to a Silicon Valley recycling firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>CleanBayArea in Milpitas, California, is trying to track down a woman in her 60s who dropped off some electronic goods in April, when she was cleaning out the garage after her husband died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In one of the boxes, buried under worthless keyboards, personal computer pieces and wires, was a 1976 Apple 1, a groundbreaking home computer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak designed and hand-built the computers and sold them for $666.66 each.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Only a few dozen are known still to exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The recycling firm sold the Apple for $200,000 in a private auction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Its policy is to split the proceeds 50-50 with the person who donated the equipment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The body was made out of wood. I've never seen anything like that. My first reaction was it was a fake. Then we started looking at it," said Victor Gichun, vice president of marketing for CleanBayArea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gichun declined to say who bought the Apple 1, only that it was a private collector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He's not sure whether the Apple is still operational.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said he will recognize the woman, who he believes is local, when he sees her and will write her out a check for $100,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The boxes sat in the company's warehouse on a pallet for a couple of weeks because they didn't expect to find anything valuable, Gichun said.</td></tr>
