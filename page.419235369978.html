<h3>'Homeland' season 5 addresses ISIS, Charlie Hebdo, Snowden</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - When "Homeland" returns for its fifth season Oct. 4 at 9 p.m. EDT on Showtime, it will face the threat of Muslim extremist group ISIS and the Charlie Hebdo massacre, its President David Nevins announced Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It deals with ISIS," Nevins told TV Critics as part of an annual summer press tour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I feel like this story is a very fresh story. Its themes, I think, will resonate with people. Charlie Hebdo. (Edward) Snowden. There's interesting elements to this season, and it brings a lot of things together. And as long as they keep it fresh, it's a show that's never the same season after season, and those kinds of shows are the shows that can run."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Season five picks up two years from the finale.</td></tr>
