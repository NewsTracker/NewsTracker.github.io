<h3>New Mexico couple gets back wedding rings lost since 1960s</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) - It's been decades since Ofelia Kirker lost her wedding rings, but she'll be wearing the treasured jewelry for her 64th wedding anniversary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It feels like we're getting married again," said her 83-year-old husband Robert Kirker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's "unbelievable to be wearing them again," said Ofelia Kirker, 82.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They had been gone for so long. It's wonderful to have them back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She believes the rings tumbled out of her pocket in the 1960s while she was living in the Grant County village of Santa Clara, reports the Las Cruces Sun-News (http://bit.ly/1AIw68Q).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They were unearthed in a yard there years ago and have finally made their way back to her thanks to an observant yard worker, one woman's sharp memory and her daughter's persistence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kirker had a habit of taking the matching white gold and diamond rings off and wrapping them in tissues while she cooked, placing the tissues in her pocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I said be more careful with your rings or you'll lose them," said her husband, Robert Kirker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And then she lost them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She remembered having them in her pocket at church and suspected they had fallen near the home of Romana Gutierrez, where the couple always parked before celebrating Sunday Mass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a panic, Kirker went to Gutierrez's house and began searching in the dirt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Mrs. Gutierrez came up to her and said, 'What are you doing, Mrs. Kirker?'" Robert Kirker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She never did, and she never replaced the rings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gutierrez's daughter, Edna Salas, said the rings were unearthed years later when Gutierrez hired someone to clean her yard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>By that time, the Kirkers had left Santa Clara.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Gutierrez didn't know how to reach them, said Salas, so she put the jewelry in a small blue box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Salas found that box in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It puzzled me because I knew they weren't my mom's rings," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"So I got on the phone, and I called my mom and asked her about the rings. She said those wedding rings belong to Ofelia Kirker."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She passed the box on to the Kirkers' daughter-in-law, who worked at a local grocery store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The bewildered daughter-in-law knew nothing about the rings and called the older couple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We were all surprised when we got the call," Robert Kirker said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But he was skeptical that the rings were actually be theirs until the daughter-in-law described them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>So the Kirkers travelled to Santa Clara to reclaim the rings and meet Edna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"It's miracle," Robert Kirker said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"We've had share of our ups and down, but this is uplifting."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The couple lost an infant daughter in a house fire and, later, a granddaughter and great-grandson in a 2012 car crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Salas said her mother, who is now 90, was happy for the Kirkers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"She closed her eyes and just smiled. So was so pleased they were finally turned over to their rightful owner," Salas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"I've got to be real careful with them now," said Kirker, who will be celebrating her 64th wedding anniversary in December.</td></tr>
