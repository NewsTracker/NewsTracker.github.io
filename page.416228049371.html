<h3>What Apple Watch pre-orders tell us about their buyers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Most people ordered the blander colors of the Apple Watch and got the watch in the larger size.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple Watch is appealing to early adopters who are (no surprise) big fans of the Apple brand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple received about 1 million pre-orders for the wearable tech last Friday, according to consumer spending research firm Slice Intelligence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Friday marked the first day the watch was available to order online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple expects to start shipping on April 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>So what can the initial orders tell us about the Apple Watch consumer?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nearly 72 percent of Apple Watch customers bought an Apple product within the past two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Of course, that makes perfect sense considering the watch works best in conjunction with the iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And for many fans it was in for a dime, in for a dollar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Almost 43 percent of those ordering Apple's latest MacBook also bought an Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nearly two-thirds of the pre-orders were for the least expensive model, the aluminum Sport line starting at $349.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Almost one-third of the orders were for the stainless steel Apple Watch, starting at $549.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Edition gold watch series, with its $10,000 price tag, didn't register enough buyers to make a dent in the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Apple has two stores in Orlando and one in Altamonte Springs.</td></tr>
