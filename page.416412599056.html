<h3>Court Sentences Ousted Egypt President to 20 Years in Prison</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this May 8, 2014 file photo, Egypt's ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi sits in a defendant cage in the Police Academy courthouse in Cairo, Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On Tuesday April 21, 2015, an Egyptian criminal court sentenced Morsi to 20 years in prison over the killing of protesters in 2012, the first verdict to be issued against the leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The case stems from violence outside the presidential palace in December 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Egypt's ousted Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, was convicted of using force against protesters and sentenced to 20 years in prison on Tuesday, the first verdict against him since he was removed by the military nearly two years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The case was the latest in a series of mass trials on a range of charges against Morsi and other members of his Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt's government has vowed to crush, branding it a terrorist organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Amnesty International denounced Morsi's trial as a "sham" - as rights groups have called many of the trials over the past two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Brotherhood went from decades as an underground organization to vault to power after Egypt's 2011 popular uprising toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Brotherhood was the biggest winner in subsequent parliament elections, and Morsi - running as its candidate - became Egypt's first freely elected president in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But a year later, millions protested against Morsi's divisive rule, and then-army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi led the military's July 2013 removal of Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Since then, a fierce crackdown has shattered the Brotherhood, killing hundreds of its supporters protesting for Morsi's return and arresting thousands more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The verdict also sparked no immediate street protests, reflecting the crackdown's impact on any show of dissent - either by Islamists or other activists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Most of the Brotherhood's top leadership already have received heavy prison sentences in other trials, as well as hundreds of death sentences laid down for senior figures and lower level supporters over acts of violence carried out during protests against Morsi's ouster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Brotherhood's top leader, Mohammed Badie, has received several death sentences in multiple cases - though they are subject to appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He appeared in court recently in the red jumpsuit worn by Egyptian prisoners on death row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>At the same time, Mubarak and members of his inner circle have largely been acquitted of charges related to the killing of protesters during the uprising against his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Charges against Mubarak over the killings were dropped earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Political science professor Hassan Nafaa said average Egyptians have seen the differences between the trials of Morsi and Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"People are not reassured of the fairness of these trials," Nafaa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The U.S. government also expressed reservations about the Morsi verdict, but State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the Obama administration would withhold judgment for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We are concerned by these sentences. All Egyptians, regardless of political affiliation, are entitled to equal and fair treatment before the law, including the full respect for their rights to due process," Harf said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We will review the basis of the verdict which I understand the Egyptian court will make public soon. I don't think we'll have much more announcements to do before a review of the basis of that verdict."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The government accuses the Brotherhood of fueling violence in the country and has rejected accusations that the judiciary is politicized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Brotherhood denies any involvement in violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But there are fears that in the face of violence a younger generation of Islamists is turning to militancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Egypt's Sinai Peninsula is the scene of a months-old insurgency by militants who have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, and there have been frequent low-level but often deadly bombings targeting police and the military in Cairo.</td></tr>
