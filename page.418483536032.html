<h3>Why Apple Music is worth every cent</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>IF YOU are looking to join a music streaming service, Apple Music is your best option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Here's why.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple music has competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>MANY have scoffed at Apple's decision to offer a music streaming service that charges $11.99 when its closest competitor, Spotify, offers an all-important, advert-supported free option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple Music may have secured a PR victory by landing Taylor Swift (her music remains absent from Spotify), but what you're really getting for that money becomes clear even before you listen to a single song.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The app first asks what genres and artists you like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>By tapping in your preferences, you essentially create a virtual music nerd, ready to recommend you things based on its encyclopaedic knowledge and library of 30 million songs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>You're instantly given dozens of playlists to dip into.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If you tell the app you like Billie Holiday, you'll get curated playlists featuring cuts from Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Washington and Nina Simone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If you say you like Rihanna and dance music, you're given a selection of the Barbadian pop star's finest remixes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>With a cornucopia of music streaming services on offer, how do you choose the one that's right for you?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Here's everything you need to know about Apple Music, Spotify and Google Play Music in two minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The more you listen, the more the service gets to know your tastes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Also sweetening the deal is Beats 1, a radio service programmed by a variety of experts, such as ex-BBC DJ Zane Lowe and hip-hop don Ebro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Beats 1 is another justification for the monthly fee even if it's a more haphazard way of finding new sounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Creating and sharing playlists of your own is an integral part of the service, while song-based radio stations are an even less labour-intensive way of keeping the music you like coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Apple has been derided for arriving late to the streaming game, but by watching what has worked and failed for the competition, being tardy might actually work in its favour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>There's nothing to lose by taking advantage of the service's three-month free trial (something Tidal doesn't offer).</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But be warned that Apple won't tell you when time's up, so it's best to turn off the auto-renewal option, as there's a good chance you may forget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Apple is no doubt banking on exactly that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But the truth is, even after the free sample, you probably won't want to lose your nerdy new friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The interface of the new Apple Music app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>I've got 99 problems and Apple Music is one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>We might not have the song selection of other services, but we are cheap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Oh my Lorde!</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Apple Music is killing it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The good: Still free for people who can put up with ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The bad: No Taylor Swift!</td></tr>
