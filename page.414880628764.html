<h3>Al-Jazeera reporter in Egypt cites employer's 'negligence'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Al-Jazeera journalists Fahmy and Baher Mohammed are free pending their retrial, scheduled for Feb. 23.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A third colleague, Peter Greste, was released two weeks ago and deported to his home country of Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - Al-Jazeera English journalist Mohamed Fahmy, who is out awaiting retrial after more than a year behind bars in Egypt on terrorism-related charges, said his Qatar-funded employer is partially to blame for his grinding ordeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fahmy said it would be "naive" and "misleading" to see the case purely as a crackdown on press freedom, because it was complicated by Al-Jazeera's "negligence" and Qatar's use of the outlet to "wage a media war" against Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I am not losing sight of who put me in prison," he said, referring to the Egyptian prosecutors, who failed to present any evidence related to the terror charges in a trial widely condemned by rights groups and major media outlets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"However, Al-Jazeera's epic negligence has made our situation harder, more difficult, and gave our captor more firepower," Fahmy said in an interview at his family home in a Cairo suburb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It is an infringement on freedom of speech to silence three innocent, recognized journalists. Yet a very important aspect of this case is Qatar abusing its Al-Jazeera Arabic platform in waging a media war against Egypt," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Al-Jazeera spokesmen did not respond to emails seeking comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The broadcaster spearheaded a global media campaign calling for the release of the reporters, insisting they were unjustly punished for doing their job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Egypt and Qatar have had tense relations since 2013, when the Egyptian military ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi amid massive protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Doha is a strong backer of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Cairo accused Al-Jazeera of being a mouthpiece for Morsi's supporters, charges denied by the broadcaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Fahmy maintained that Al-Jazeera English, for which he was bureau chief for just three months before being detained in December 2013, was doing balanced and independent reporting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Al-Jazeera's Arabic affiliates, however, were the only remaining platform for Islamists to criticize the military-backed government after Morsi's ouster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Fahmy said his senior managers failed to provide the English network's staff with enough security, and to explain to the Egyptian government that they were different from the Arabic stations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They should have provided a security umbrella and put the security of their staffers ahead of getting the story, because it was framed as Al-Jazeera and Qatar are challenging the Egyptian government," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He also said Al-Jazeera failed to provide press passes or equipment permits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Al-Jazeera has said that lacking press credentials is an administrative matter that should never have landed the reporters in criminal court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After a purely Egyptian affiliate of the network was ordered closed by a court in September 2013, the network continued to broadcast from its Doha studios, relying on amateur videos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>At least 11 defendants were tried with Fahmy and the others allegedly for providing amateur videos to the network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Late last year, before a retrial was ordered, Al-Jazeera shut down its Egyptian affiliate, in what was seen as part of a thaw in the relations between Cairo and Doha.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But tensions flared again over Egypt's recent airstrikes in Libya, when an Egyptian official accused Qatar of funding terror groups there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Fahmy said the new tiff will likely complicate matters for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Al-Jazeera's lawyer quit during the course of the trial in a highly emotional scene in which he also accused the broadcaster of jeopardizing its staff by choosing to sue the Egyptian government for $150 million for closing its offices and jamming its signal at the height of the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Fahmy is now raising funds for his own defense team, which includes Amal Clooney, who has waived 90 percent of her fees, he said.</td></tr>
