<h3>'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' review: Season 10 is a dud</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>We're entering the 10th season of "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," which for actual entertainment value is like having spent 10 years in Rapid City, S.D., watching the traffic lights change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bruce Jenner, recently divorced from Kardashian Mom Kris Jenner, has given signals he's thinking of transitioning from male to female.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Olympic decathlon champion maybe decides he's been a woman trapped in a man's body for 65 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Seems worth mentioning in Sunday's season premiere episode, you think?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jenner does play a central role in the episode - after first Kourtney and then the others suspect he might be "dating" one of Kris' friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In "KUWTK" world, this is like discovering Mayor DeBlasio had sold City Hall naming rights to ISIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Soon the show is beating this hollow horse to death, as the Jenner and Kardashian sides of the family throw separate "cheer up" parties for Bruce and Kris, complete with gobs of sexual innuendo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Telling footnote: The girls want to invite both sides of the family to Kris's party, but then they like, y'know, like just forget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Like, what-ever, who cares when there are way more important things going on like whether Khloe will let Kim look at her closet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In other business Sunday, because some viewers will be wondering, we do see some judicious glimpses of Kim's nude photo shoot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And of course we get some dirty girl talk.</td></tr>

<h3>Russell Brand doc opens at SXSW ? without Russell Brand</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Russell Brand a no-show for SXSW premiere The documentary follows bad boy British entertainer Russell Brand's turbulent ride from stand-up comic to movie star, addict and activist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>AUSTIN - BRAND: A Second Coming, the new documentary on the turbulent life of British actor/comedian Russell Brand, offers all the elements one would expect from such a work: Brand being hilarious on stage, Brand strung out on drugs, Brand flirting with crowds of eager women, Brand naked on a police van waving a red flag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the most revealing moments in BRAND, which had its world premiere at South by Southwest Film Festival Friday night, are the small snippets when he looks directly at the camera and offers glimpses into his stormy psyche.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The film, by award-winning filmmaker Ondi Timoner, follows Brand from his small-town roots and struggling stand-up comic act to global movie star, through his harrowing descent into hardcore drug and sex addiction, the breakup of his marriage to pop star Katy Perry, and his resurgence through rehab and transcendental meditation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Brand shot to stardom in films such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek and his live concert performance Messiah Complex, before seemingly evacuating the limelight a few years ago for a life as a political activist and professional rabble-rouser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Comedian Russell Brand joins residents and supporters from a housing estate in East London as they demonstrate against U.S. investment company plans to evict 93 families on Dec. 1, 2014, in London, England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>BRAND was SXSW Film Festival's opening night film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Fans and the media lined up early outside the Paramount Theater in downtown Austin alongside a red carpet, hoping to catch a glimpse of cast and crew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But notably missing: Brand himself, who canceled his SXSW appearance just hours before the premiere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In a colorfully-worded, 414-word statement posted on his website, Brand described struggling with the movie project for more than seven years and as many directors before teaming up with Timoner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He apologized to event organizers for bailing out, saying watching the film again would be too "painful."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"My life was hard enough the first time 'round and going through it again was painful and sad," Brand said in the statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I know Ondi is an artist and I'm told the film is good but for me watching it was very uncomfortable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Timoner, a two-time winner of Sundance Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize for documentaries for earlier films Dig!</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>and We Live in Public, said she heard Brand wasn't coming and immediately thought of Get Him to the Greek, where Brand's character, an out-of-control British rock star, struggles to reach a concert in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"This is a painful experience for him to have this film come out," Timoner told USA TODAY before the premiere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Probably, it's a little bit terrifying because it's so personal and so raw. But at the end of the day, I know people are going to love him for this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The film at times depicts Brand, 39, in an unflattering light, showing his self-comparisons to Jesus and using his fame to serially sleep with women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In one particularly difficult scene, a friend's home video footage shows a young Brand squatting in a corner of a room in London smoking drugs from an aluminum square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Shortly after, Brand enters rehab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Brand struggles with his mom's cancer diagnosis and a mostly absent father who bonds with his grown son by taking him to hotel parties with prostitutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But Timoner also peels back Brand's many layers to reveal a thoughtful, complex person in constant pursuit of life's deeper meaning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Brand appears to have an epiphany when he attends a glitzy fashion show in Paris with then-wife Perry, then travels to Kenya and witnesses children foraging through garbage piles alongside feral pigs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"This is hell," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"And we're creating it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The incident launches him onto a path toward activism that leads to his YouTube show The Trews and frequent visits to "Occupy" street protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Throughout the film, Brand's comedic vigor pokes through, whether describing his drugged-out, naked protest atop of a police van on a cold London day or his hilarious barbing with the befuddled on-air staff during a live MSNBC interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The film shows Brand shuttling between concert shows and TV interviews, to visits to addiction clinics to hug clients, and to marathon meditation sessions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"He's an artist of genius proportions," comedian Rosie O'Donnell says in the film, "only with the desire to serve."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Brand never truly answers if he'll return to Hollywood or continue calling for cultural and political revolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Or both.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In one scene, he surveys a group of adjoining buildings in London that he envisions some day turning into a non-profit online studio and cafe run by recovering addicts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Nothing will ever be enough," Brand tells the camera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Ever."</td></tr>
