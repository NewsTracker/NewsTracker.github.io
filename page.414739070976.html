<h3>Help arrives for Kiwis on ice-trapped boat in Antarctica</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Australian-flagged Antarctic Chieftain became trapped around 1,700km from McMurdo Sound after damaging three of the four blades of its propeller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The United States Coast Guard icebreaker CG Polar Star reached the area earlier today and managed to break the ice trapping the vessel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A ROV (remotely operated underwater vehicle) was deployed to assess the damage to the propellers and whether the ship was capable of making way through the ice under its own power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The blades were assessed as too badly damaged for the vessel to be able to use them for propulsion from the ice field," says RCCNZ Search and Rescue Mission Coordinator Conrad Reynecke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The crew on the Polar Star then rigged up tow lines and began to tow the Antarctic Chieftain to open water. They are making slow, but steady progress and are currently approximately 60 nautical miles from clear water in the North," Mr Reynecke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The fishing boat's hull is not damaged, and there has been no spill of oil from the vessel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Meanwhile the New Zealand-flagged fishing boat Janas is also making its way to the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The boat is around 900 km to the north-west and is expected to reach the area on Monday night.</td></tr>
