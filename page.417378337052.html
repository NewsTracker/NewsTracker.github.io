<h3>FIFA Corruption Scandal: More Charges Likely</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sepp Blatter says he is "shocked" at the way the US judiciary has targeted FIFA and slammed a "hate" campaign by Europe's football leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His comments come as a top American investigator said he was "fairly confident" there would be more indictments in the corruption scandal engulfing world football's governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Blatter was re-elected for a fifth term as FIFA president on Friday, two days after 14 people - nine current or former FIFA officials and five business executives - were indicted by the US over alleged bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In an interview with Swiss television, Mr Blatter said he suspected the arrests were an attempt to "interfere with the congress" at which he was elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Blatter, 79, told RTS: "I am not certain, but it doesn't smell good."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He also hit out at comments about FIFA made by US judiciary leaders, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Of course I am shocked. I would never as FIFA president make comments about another organisation without being certain of what has happened," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ms Lynch had said corruption in football was "rampant, systemic and deep-rooted, both abroad and here in the United States".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Blatter also noted that the US was the "number one sponsor" of Jordan, where his challenger for the FIFA presidency Prince Ali bin al Hussein comes from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He also pointed out that the US lost the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, and England, another major critic, lost the 2018 World Cup to Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Swiss bureaucrat also condemned the head of European football's governing body, Michel Platini, who was one of many calling for Mr Blatter's resignation over the scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It is a hate that comes not just from a person at UEFA, it comes from the UEFA organisation that cannot understand that in 1998 I became president," Mr Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Asked whether he would forgive Mr Platini for the resignation calls, Mr Blatter said: "I forgive everyone but I do not forget."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Blatter is due to address FIFA's executive committee on Saturday morning, where he will outline how he plans to do to address the organisation's image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Earlier, Richard Weber, head of the Internal Revenue Service's criminal investigations unit, told the New York Times: "I'm fairly confident that we will have another round of indictments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We strongly believe there are other people and entities involved in criminal acts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Weber would not identify the remaining targets of the investigation, or say whether Mr Blatter was among them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He also dismissed the idea the US government was on a mission to topple the leadership of FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr Weber said: "I don't think there was ever a decision or a declaration that we would go after soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We were going after corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Federal authorities told the newspaper the timing of the indictments had nothing to do with the presidential election and was not an attempt to damage the re-election changes of Mr Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>However, agents thought it was better to wait until FIFA officials gathered in Switzerland for the organisation's congress to make it easier to arrest people from around the world, according to the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>An IRS spokesman confirmed Mr Weber made the remarks and said the case is "open and ongoing".</td></tr>
