<h3>Aust leaders plead for Bali Nine pair</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As Bali Nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan face imminent execution, Australia is urging Indonesia to make sure all judicial processes are cleared of corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The pair could be facing a firing squad as early as Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says it's not too late for a change of heart by Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>New allegations of corruption have been made against the judges who sentenced the pair to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ms Bishop says a judicial commission should be allowed to complete its investigation into the claims, along with action Sukumaran and Chan are taking in the constitutional court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I've asked Foreign Minister (Retno) Marsudi that no action be taken in relation to those executions until these legal processes have been determined," she told ABC radio on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Her parliamentary secretary Steve Ciobo said Australians wanted to know the whole process had been free from the taint of corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott also has made a last-minute plea by writing to Indonesian president Joko Widodo asking him to spare the lives of Sukumaran and Chan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This is not in the best interests of Indonesia, let alone the best interests of the young Australians concerned," he told reporters in France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ms Bishop cautioned that going ahead with the executions could harm Indonesia's international reputation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"When the secretary general of the United Nations wades into the debate, I think that this is a global issue," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek says it appears Mr Widodo is ignoring international calls for clemency and others from his own people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"There are very many Indonesians saying now that it is a very serious issue to proceed with these sentences before the legal processes are complete," she told ABC radio.</td></tr>
