<h3>Ohio judge recommends police officers face charges in Tamir Rice case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tadar Muhammad (right) and Jeremy Brustein (left) demonstrate in support of Tamir Rice outside of Quicken Loans Arena prior to game three of the NBA Finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CLEVELAND A Cleveland judge on Thursday found probable cause that a police officer who shot to death a 12-year-old boy last year should face a murder charge in an opinion that puts pressure on prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine said Cleveland police officer Timothy Loehmann, whose shooting of Tamir Rice was captured on video, should face charges including murder, involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Loehmann's partner, Frank Garmback, should face negligent homicide and dereliction of duty charges, he found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Adrine's opinion does not compel charges or require the officers' arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This court is mindful that despite any conclusions it draws ... its role here is advisory in nature," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rice's death is one of several recent cases that raised questions about police use of force in the United States, particularly against minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The two Cleveland officers involved in the shooting are white, and Rice was black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The ruling came days after eight community leaders filed affidavits requesting action from the court in the death of Rice, who was holding a replica gun when he was shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said in a statement on Thursday that the case will go to a grand jury, as is the policy for all police lethal force incidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a statement regarding Adrine's opinion, Rice's family said: "We are grateful that the wheels of justice are starting to turn."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Adrine was responding to a complaint filed under a little-used 1960 law that allows citizens to seek an arrest and criminal charges directly through the courts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the judge said he could not file charges or issue an arrest warrant in this case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Rice was shot outside a recreation center last November while playing with a airsoft-type replica handgun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Loehmann fired at Rice twice within two seconds of arriving at the scene with Garmback in response to a 911 emergency call about a man with a gun outside the recreation center, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The sixth-grader died the next day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Adrine said that after viewing video of the incident several times, "this court is still thunderstruck at how quickly this event turned deadly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The county sheriff's department completed its investigation of the shooting last week, without revealing any conclusions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Cleveland's police department agreed last month on a plan to minimize racial bias and the use of excessive force after the U.S. Justice Department found a pattern of abuses against civilians by police.</td></tr>
