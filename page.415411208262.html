<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A cameraman on her team became sick with the virus and upon returning to the United States, Snyderman and other members of the NBC team were put on a self-imposed quarantine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She was spotted out in public, violating that quarantine, prompting the state of New Jersey to issue a mandatory quarantine for the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I stepped out of the [operating room] a few years ago, and it is now time for me to return to my roots, so I am stepping down from my position as chief medical editor at NBC News," Snyderman's statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Covering the Ebola epidemic last fall in Liberia, and then becoming part of the story upon my return to the U.S., contributed to my decision that now is the time to return to academic medicine.</td></tr>
