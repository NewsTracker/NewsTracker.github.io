<h3>Jury deliberations to begin in Boston Marathon bombing trial</h3>

<tr><td>2</td><td>Jury deliberations to begin in Boston Marathon bombing trial BOSTON -- A federal jury on Tuesday will begin deliberations on the fate of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Here are the facts in the case against Boston Marathon Bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Closing arguments concluded Monday in the guilt-or-innocence phase of the trial with prosecutors ratcheting up their case that Tsarnaev, 21, is not the "passive, go-along-to-get-along guy" they say the defense made him out to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Three people died and more than 260 were injured in twin blasts April 15, 2013 near the finish line of the marathon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If Tsarnaev is convicted -- and his lawyer has not denied Tsarnaev's involvement -- a hearing would be held to determine if he is executed or is sentenced to life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Prosecutors described Tsarnaev as a true believer in the cause of radical, violent jihad to avenge what he saw as harm by the U.S. against Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The plan was to make this bombing as memorable as it could possibly be," said Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The two sides clashed over the meaning of Tsarnaev's writings in the backyard boat where he was found after a shootout with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The shootout ended when he fled in a stolen Mercedes SUV, running over his injured brother, Tamerlan, 26, who died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty spoke at length about Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's secret life of recorded lectures, magazine articles and music of the violent jihad movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>From that life came the boat writings that reflected Tsarnaev's true motives, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The U.S. government is killing our innocent civilians," Chakravarty read from what was scrawled in the blood-stained boat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"As a Muslim," Tsarnaev had written, "I can't stand see to such evil go unpunished."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Defense attorney Judy Clarke said the writings did not represent Tsarnaev's "message to the world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>If he had been a true jihadi, he would have penned "Death to America!" she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Instead, he wrote what she termed "a 19-year-old's attempt to tell why they did what they did."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"He knew all along it was wrong to take innocent life," Clarke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"But he expressed the very twisted belief ... that his actions would make a difference."</td></tr>
