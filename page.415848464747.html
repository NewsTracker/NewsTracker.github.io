<h3>Bangladesh police say blogger hacked to death in capital</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The killing took place a month after a prominent Bangladeshi-American blogger known for speaking out against religious extremism was hacked to death in Dhaka by unidentified assailants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the latest incident, Washiqur Rahman Babu was declared dead as he was taken to a government hospital shortly after being attacked in Dhaka's Tejgaon area, Dhaka Metropolitan Police official Biplob Kumar Sarker said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Two suspects were captured and three meat cleavers were recovered, Sarker said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The captured suspects were students at separate Islamic schools, and the third suspect fled the scene, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was not immediately known what sort of blogging Babu did, Sarker said, adding that the suspects told police that they targeted him for his anti-Islamic writings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Two of the victim's cousins told reporters at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where Babu's body was being kept, that Babu recently joined a travel agency in Dhaka after finishing his studies, but they were not aware of any blog he had kept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Local media reported that Babu had a Facebook page that contained the line "Iamavijit," meaning he was a follower of Avijit Roy, the Bangladeshi-American blogger who was hacked to death late last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Roy, a Bangladesh-born U.S. citizen, died after he was attacked on Dhaka University campus when he was leaving a book fair with his wife.</td></tr>
