<tr><td>3</td><td>Explosions could also be heard, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kenya's National Police Service said in a written statement that armed attackers forced their way onto the campus by shooting at guards, triggering a "fierce shootout" with police guarding student hostels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, the attackers managed to get into the hostels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The statement, which did not mention a death toll, said police and members of other security agencies were "engaged in an elaborate process of flushing out the gunmen from the hostels."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A policewoman at the scene told the Reuters news agency the gunmen were likely to have taken hostages because many students remain trapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>No group has claimed responsibility for the raid yet, Reuters reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Kenya's northern and eastern regions, which border Somalia, have been most affected by attacks blamed on al Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab Islamic extremists from Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They have vowed retribution against Kenya for sending its troops to Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Kenya took that step in 2011 to fight al-Shabaab following cross-border attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In February, al-Shabaab released an online video in which it appeared to call for attacks on Western malls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The video specifically named the Mall of America in Minnesota, the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, and London's Oxford Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In 2013, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for an attack on an upscale shopping mall in Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>More than 60 people were killed in the four-day siege when attackers stormed the Westgate Mall in the capital, Nairobi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Last month, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for attacks in the county of Mandera on the Somali border in which twelve people died.</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>The militants hijacked a bus and singled out 28 non-Muslims forcing them to lie on the ground before shooting them dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Ten days later, 36 non-Muslim quarry workers were killed by the extremists.</td></tr>
