<h3>Skid Row Shaken as Los Angeles Police Kill Man in Confrontation Caught on Video</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The occasional police car drove by.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the middle of the block, flowers were piled next to a note bidding goodbye to a man who had called this piece of sidewalk his home until Sunday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The man, whom the police have not identified but who was known here as "Africa," was shot to death shortly after noon on Sunday as officers tried to arrest him as a suspect in a robbery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The killing followed a series of episodes involving the deaths of apparently unarmed civilians at the hands of the police across the country that have raised questions about law enforcement tactics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A four-minute video of the fatal encounter here and its aftermath, which was taken by a bystander and uploaded to Facebook, has become a new symbol of what many people see as police abuses directed against minorities and the homeless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Witnesses here said the encounter came as the police, who have been under pressure from business leaders to deal with this searing symbol of the nation's homeless problem just blocks from a resurgent downtown, were trying to get people to take down tents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Many resisted: Los Angeles, though in the midst of a drought, was drenched with a series of intense and bone-chilling rainstorms through Sunday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The cops don't want us here," Ernie Soto, 34, who lay in a blanket near where the shooting took place, said Monday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They tried to make an example out of him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This is Skid Row," said Mr. Soto, who said he had lived on the streets of Los Angeles since losing a job eight years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This is for the homeless. I wish I could have a home, but it didn't work out that way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The police said the shooting took place after the suspect resisted arrest and grabbed for the gun of an officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At a news conference Monday afternoon, the police chief, Charlie Beck, displayed blowups of images from a video, apparently taken by an onlooker, that he said showed the suspect apparently reaching for an officer's gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I have reviewed the video and the audio, and preliminarily you can hear the young officer who is primarily engaged in the confrontation saying, 'He has my gun, he has my gun,' " Chief Beck said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"He said this several times."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It appears to me that the officers acted compassionately up until the time that force was required," Chief Beck added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"These are very difficult situations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Investigators are going to have ample evidence to work from: In addition to video taken by bystanders, two of the police officers were wearing body cameras - part of an effort this city is taking to equip most officers with those devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"At this early stage, we are still very far away from a determination about everything that happened," Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said in a separate news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr. Garcetti was quick to defend the police department, which after a long history of corruption and rough history with minority communities is now widely seen in a positive light by residents here and by police watchdogs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This is one of the most progressive forces anywhere in the world," Mr. Garcetti said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Is this a force that never makes a mistake? Of course not."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A video of the episode starts with the man swinging his arms at four police officers who have him surrounded on a sidewalk lined with tents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>An officer drops his nightstick and begins punching the man, knocking him to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The officer then straddles the man, who continues to struggle as two more officers arrive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In the video, a woman standing nearby picks up the nightstick and appears to aim it at the officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Two officers wrestle her to the ground and place her in handcuffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>While the remaining officers struggle with the suspect, the buzzing of a Taser can be heard; the police said that weapon had proved ineffective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The primary officer repeats the command three times before a shot is fired, followed by four more rounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Two officers can be seen with their weapons drawn as the man lies motionless on the sidewalk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Two officers suffered minor injuries during the encounter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"They didn't have to kill the man," said Jesse Hayes, 39, who lives on the street here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"They are trained in martial arts, weight lifting. Come on man. Police are harassing people every day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Irene Acero, 39, said she had been in church at the time of the shooting and had emerged to find the street in chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"I knew him," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"He was a good guy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>She and Mr. Soto described the man as mentally unstable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Mr. Soto said the man had settled on a piece of sidewalk under a cross painted on a building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"He used to pray to the cross," Mr. Soto said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The shooting came as this city has been struggling to deal with its homeless population, which is spread across the region, but is concentrated on Skid Row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The situation has become increasingly acute as there has been an explosion of downtown development and gentrification, putting pressure on city officials to clean up the street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"There's no other part of the country with that level of concentrated homelessness," said Jerry Jones, the executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Steve Soboroff, the president of the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners, said the abundance of evidence would prove invaluable in the investigation of whether the police were justified in their actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"There's a tendency to try to group this with the incidents in Ferguson and the incidents in New York," he said in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"We are not the same police force, we don't have the same procedure, and these cases were not similar. It's really important for every one of us - the citizenry, law enforcement - not to jump to foregone conclusions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The shooting set off bitter criticism by advocates for the homeless over how the police and deal with people living on the streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"Here's a situation where you have an unarmed homeless man and you have six police officers, by my count, who came to apprehend the suspect," Mr. Jones said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"This is another senseless death of another unarmed black man at the hands of police."</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Bruce Naivi, 37, a homeless man living near where the shooting took place, said he was not surprised by what had happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"I do not feel that the police are here to protect me," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"I feel more like they have a badge to kill."</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2015, on page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Use of Force Is Criticized in Skid Row Shooting.</td></tr>

<h3>Iraq launches operation to retake Tikrit from Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Previous attempts to capture the symbolic city have failed, and hours into Monday's operation, the military said it still hadn't entered Tikrit, indicating a long battle lies ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Retaking it will help Iraqi forces secure a major supply link for any future operation to retake Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city which has been under militant rule since June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>State-run Al-Iraqiya television said that forces were attacking from different directions, backed by artillery and airstrikes by Iraqi fighter jets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It said the militants were dislodged from some areas outside the city, but several hours into the operation, it gave no additional details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tikrit, the provincial capital of Salauhddin province, 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Baghdad, fell to the Islamic State group last summer, along with Mosul and other areas in the country's Sunni heartland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>U.S. military officials have said a coordinated military mission to retake Mosul will likely begin in April or May and involve up to 25,000 Iraqi troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the Americans have cautioned that if the Iraqis aren't ready, the offensive could be delayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The U.S.-led coalition launching airstrikes targeting the Islamic State group was not involved in the Tikrit operation, Iraqi officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Pentagon spokesman, Army Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Steve Warren, said the U.S. was alerted to the offensive before it started Monday but was not asked to provide air power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Right now we are not providing any air power to support the Iraqi operation in the city of Tikrit," Warren told reporters in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We did note the Iraqi government's statements that they are emphasizing minimization of collateral damage, and we are continuing to monitor it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Iraqi forces apparently have the help of Iranian Gen. Ghasem Soleimani, the commander of the elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, who arrived two days ago, the Iranian semi-official Fars news agency reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The powerful general has emerged as the chief tactician in Iraq's fight against the Sunni militants, working on the front lines alongside dozens of advisers from his country's Revolutionary Guard to direct Shiite militiamen and government forces in the smallest details of battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Fars also reported drones were flying over Tikrit, without identifying whether they were Iranian or Iraqi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The military commander of Salahuddin region, Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, told state TV fighting was taking place outside Tikrit mainly on its eastern side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Until this moment we have not entered the city," al-Saadi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"God willing, we will enter, but we need some time as planned. ... God willing, victory will be achieved and Salahuddin will be turned into a grave for all terrorist groups."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tikrit is an important test case for Iraq's Shiite-led government, which is trying to reassert authority over the divided country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Islamic State fighters have a strong presence in the city and are expected to put up fierce resistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Past attempts to retake Tikrit have failed, as Iraq struggles with its armed forces, which collapsed in the wake of the Islamic State group's offensive last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The offensive comes as momentum has begun to shift since Iraqi soldiers, backed by airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition, took back the nearby refinery town of Beiji in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Any operation to take Mosul would require Iraq to seize Tikrit first because of its strategic location for military enforcements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Iraq is bitterly split between minority Sunnis, who were an important base of support for Saddam, and the Shiite majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Since Saddam was toppled in a U.S.-led invasion in 2003, the Sunni minority has felt increasingly marginalized by the Shiite-led government in Baghdad, and in 2006 long-running tensions boiled over into sectarian violence that claimed tens of thousands of lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>While state TV said Shiite and Sunni tribal fighters were cooperating in Monday's offensive, Tikrit is an important Sunni stronghold, and the presence of Shiite forces could prompt a backlash among Sunnis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Iraqi military is heavily dependent on Shiite militias that have been accused of abusing Sunni communities elsewhere in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Hours after the offensive began, the U.N. special envoy in Iraq appealed to warring groups to avoid attacking civilians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Military operations reinforced by international and Iraqi air support must be conducted with the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties, and with full respect for fundamental human rights principles and humanitarian law," Nickolay Mladenov said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Monday afternoon, a gasoline tanker rigged with a bomb exploded as soldiers and Shiite militiamen tried to dismantle it in the village of al-Jalam south of Tikrit, killing seven troops and wounding 15, police and hospital officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Al-Jalam, a farming area that has been a stronghold of Sunni militants, is located outside the Sunni city of Samarra, 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Ahead of the operation, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, a Shiite, called on Sunni tribal fighters to abandon the Islamic State extremist group, offering what he described as "the last chance" and promising them a pardon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"I call upon those who have been misled or committed a mistake to lay down arms and join their people and security forces in order to liberate their cities," al-Abadi said Sunday during a news conference in Samarra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>His comments appeared to be targeting former members of Iraq's outlawed Baath party, loyalists to Saddam, who joined the Islamic State group during its offensive, as well as other Sunnis who were dissatisfied with Baghdad's Shiite-led government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Saddam, whose Sunni-dominated government ruled the country for some two decades, was executed after his ouster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Tikrit frequently saw attacks on U.S. forces during the American occupation of the country.</td></tr>
