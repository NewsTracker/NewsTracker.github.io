<h3>Yahoo closing last China operation in Beijing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Beijing operation's responsibilities will be shifted to other Yahoo Inc. offices, according to a company statement released late Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yahoo didn't specify how many people will lose their jobs in China, but pledged to treat all the workers "with respect and fairness."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The closure will mark Yahoo's exit from China, where the Sunnyvale, California, company has been winding down since turning over its operations to Alibaba Group in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That $1 billion deal gave Yahoo a lucrative stake in Alibaba that is currently worth $33 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Yahoo is preparing to spin off its Alibaba holdings into a separately traded company later this year, removing an asset that deflected attention from the challenges facing Yahoo's own businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Yahoo hired Mayer in July 2012 to engineer a turnaround, but so far she hasn't been able to boost the company's revenue even though advertisers have been shifting more of their spending to the Internet and mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Yahoo's revenue declined by 1 percent to $4.6 billion last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>New York hedge fund Starboard Value, an activist investor that owns a 0.8 percent stake in Yahoo, is among the shareholders who believe Mayer needs to trim expenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In an open letter released earlier this month, Starboard Value Managing Member Jeffrey Smith urged Mayer to cut costs by about $450 million annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Smith is also among the Yahoo shareholders who called upon Mayer to spin off the Alibaba stake to avoid triggering a huge tax bill from sale of the stake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a January conference call, Mayer emphasized that Yahoo's payroll has remained roughly the same size since she arrived, even though the company had inherited more than 1,000 employees through acquisitions completed during her reign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She also pointed out that Yahoo had closed about a dozen offices while phasing out about 75 products during her tenure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We will continue to seek and execute on efficiencies that we find on an ongoing basis as an effort to better align our resources with our strategy and growth opportunities," Mayer pledged.</td></tr>

<h3>Tiger shark chomps on snorkeling man</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said the man was bitten by a 10-12 foot tiger shark while snorkeling with family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The shark was seen again after the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The park was closed and shark warnings were posted along parts of the coast outside the park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The public is being warned to use caution when entering the water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Flyovers were planned for Thursday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If a shark is spotted, the park will remain closed; if not, it will reopen at noon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hawaii is home to approximately 40 species of sharks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The tiger shark, which can reach up to 16-feet in length, has been called "the garbage can of the sea" because of its wide variety of prey, according to the state's shark website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A NOAA fact sheet says the tiger is one of the top sharks involved in unprovoked fatal attacks throughout the world and is the leading attack species in Hawaii.</td></tr>
