<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BAGHDAD, May 21 (Reuters) - Iraqi forces said they thwarted a third attempt by Islamic State to break through their defensive lines east of the city of Ramadi overnight on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Police and pro-government Sunni fighters exchanged mortar and sniper fire with the militants across the new frontline in Husaiba al-Sharqiya, where security forces have dug trenches to prevent the insurgents pushing further east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ramadi fell to the insurgents on Sunday in the most significant setback for Iraqi security forces in nearly a year, calling into question the U.S.-led strategy to "degrade and destroy" the Islamist group.</td></tr>
