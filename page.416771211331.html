<h3>Facebook's Sandberg emerges to speak at husband's memorial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>STANFORD, Calif, May 5 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg re-emerged in public on Tuesday after the accidental death of her husband last week, telling a Silicon Valley memorial service about his effortless compassion and selflessness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Many of the technology world's top executives filled a 1,700-seat auditorium at Stanford University to commemorate David Goldberg, chief executive of SurveyMonkey, who died at age 47 on Friday during a vacation in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He fell off a treadmill and hit his head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The ceremony was a tribute to the low-key executive, whose marriage to Sandberg added to his fame from building a company valued at $2 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Speakers described Goldberg's self-deprecation, modesty and selflessness, and the event, closed to the press, included several nods to his passions: on their way out, guests were handed Minnesota Vikings baseball caps as a reminder of the Minneapolis-born Goldberg's lighthearted nature and love of sports, according to a person who attended the service and declined to be identified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>During the ceremony, Bono sang "One."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Goldberg's brother, Robert Goldberg, who announced the death on Saturday morning on Facebook, and several friends spoke at the private service, the person said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Many guests entered through side and back doors after driving into a cordoned-off area behind the hall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some, such as Hewlett Packard Chief Executive Meg Whitman, walked up the steps and through the main entrance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Whitman declined to speak with reporters after the service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Many began offering personal tributes to Goldberg on social media on Saturday, including Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sandberg, however, remained silent until Tuesday morning, when she responded to a public note by President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"David Goldberg embodied the definition of a real leader - someone who was always looking for ways to empower others," the president wrote in a Facebook message signed B.O., meaning he personally wrote it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We're heartbroken by him leaving us far too soon - but we celebrate a remarkable legacy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>(https://www.facebook.com/WhiteHouse).</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Sandberg in turn took to Facebook, thanking Obama for his friendship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Dave Goldberg admired you for your leadership, passion, and your deep love of sports," she wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She also changed her Facebook cover photo on Tuesday morning to a picture of her dancing with Goldberg at their wedding in 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Goldberg built SurveyMonkey into a poll-taking juggernaut after joining the company in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He previously worked for venture firm Benchmark, after founding Launch Media and selling it to Yahoo Inc in 2001.</td></tr>
