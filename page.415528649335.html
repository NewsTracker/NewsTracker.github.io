<h3>Greece seeking joint Merkel-Hollande talks on bailout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras listens during his meeting with Assistant U.S. Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, in Athens, on Tuesday, March 17, 2015.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece has called for joint talks with leaders of Germany, France and the European Union executive to try and resolve the crisis surrounding the country's bailout negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras proposed meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a senior Greek government official told The Associated Press Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The talks would be held in Brussels on Thursday ahead of an EU leaders' meeting, said the official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity pending official announcements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There was no immediate response to the Greek request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I have now no confirmation of any particular meeting arrangements," EU Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This is now the moment for technical discussions between the experts including Greece, and we need swift progress on implementing the Greek reform commitments."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>European creditor states are in talks with Greece on a list of reforms it should present by the end of April in order to receive the next batch of rescue loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The talks, however, are not progressing quickly and Greece faces a cash crunch in coming weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In Paris, a government official who also asked not to be identified said the French government was waiting to hear from bailout inspectors currently in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Depending on their results, we'll need to see if financing solutions are necessary sooner than at the end of April," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Late Tuesday, Greek officials said they were determined to go ahead with a key piece of draft legislation, despite opposition from the country's creditors who - the officials said - wanted to vet the proposed law before it was presented in parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis said there had been "objections and baseless complaints" over the draft law, which meets a core pledge by the radical left-led government to address what it calls Greece's "humanitarian crisis" by providing free power and food coupons to the country's poorest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>One senior government official invited opposition parties to "resist the blackmail" and back the proposed legislation during a vote in parliament scheduled for Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"If in Europe in 2015 addressing the humanitarian crisis is considered a unilateral action, then what is left of European values?" the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tsipras, who was elected on Jan. 25, is due to meet Merkel in Berlin on Monday and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on April 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On Tuesday, he met in Athens with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The prospect of a Brussels meeting saw Greek borrowing rates ease and shares on the Athens Stock exchange rebound from losses a day earlier, closing up nearly 1 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Attention, however, also turned to Tsipras' outspoken finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, who was quizzed on German television over the weekend on a speech he gave two years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>An online video of his appearance showed Varoufakis making a rude gesture when referring to Germany, a lead creditor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Varoufakis said that the version shown on the program had been doctored and later tweeted a video of the full version of his speech - also showing him raising his middle finger while saying: "My proposal was that Greece should simply announce that it is defaulting - just like Argentina did - within the euro, in January 2010, and stick the finger to Germany and say: Well now you can solve this problem by yourself."</td></tr>
