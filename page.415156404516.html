<h3>Nurse who was first person infected with Ebola in U.S. sues Dallas hospital</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The first person infected with Ebola in the United States, nurse Nina Pham, sued a Texas hospital on Monday, saying it did not do enough to prevent her from contracting the deadly virus and invaded her privacy after she was diagnosed with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the suit against Texas Health Resources (THR) in Dallas County Court, Pham claims the hospital did not initially provide nurses with proper protective equipment or properly train staff on how to treat the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The suit accuses the hospital of negligence and deception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It does not specify an amount in damages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Pham, 26, was one of two nurses at the Dallas hospital who contracted the disease when treating Thomas Duncan, who was admitted in late September and died less than two weeks later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Both nurses recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Duncan contracted the disease in Liberia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Pham became a national symbol of hope in fighting Ebola after she made a recovery and was greeted in the Oval Office by President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The suit claims that the THR's Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital did not initially provide adequate protective gear for medical staff or instructions on how to treat someone with Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It also describes a hospital in chaos, where medical waste that could have carried the virus was left to pile up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The nurses were just using their best guesses and their instincts to protect themselves," the suit said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The hospital did not address the details of Pham's accusations and said in a statement: "As distressing as the lawsuit is to us, we remain optimistic that we can resolve this matter with Nina."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Pham claims the hospital used her as a "public relations pawn" to improve its plummeting image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While it issued news releases saying her condition had improved to "good," it was having end of life conversations with her, Pham alleges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Pham said the hospital did not respect her right to privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In one instance, she was videotaped speaking to a doctor and the video was released to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Pham said both the taping and release happened without her permission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I was hoping that THR would be more open and honest about everything that happened at the hospital, and the things they didn't do that led to me getting infected with Ebola. But that didn't happen and I felt I was left with no choice but to turn to the courts for help," Pham said in a statement.</td></tr>

<h3>Did climate change trigger the war in Syria?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Drought caused by climate change may pushed Syria towards the devastating civil war currently riping the country apart, according to researchers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A new study has found that many parts of the country were hit by a record dry period between 2006 and 2010 which may have propelled the uprising against the Syrian regime in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The drought, which scientists say was likely made worse by climate change, destroyed much of the agriculture in the north of the country, driving farmers into cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The resulting rising urban populations combined with poverty, government mismanagement and other factors combined to trigger the unrest that led to the civil war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The conflict hjas since escalated into a complex war involving extremist Islamic groups including ISIS and forces from other nations including the US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The brutal civil war in Syria has left a trail of destruction so deep on the landscape that it can be seen from space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Researchers at the American Association for the Advancement of Science analyzed high-resolution satellite images of Aleppo taken from August 2012 to May 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They noticed a dramatic increase in the damage to buildings and infrastructure over the 10-month period, with almost all of the destruction concentrated in rebel-controlled or contested areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They also found that the historic 13th century walled ancient city of Aleppo - a UNESCO World Heritage Site - has also suffered extensive damage from the war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Satellite images have also shown how the proliferation of roadblocks and build up of artillery and tanks have increased.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In separate satellite images released by Amnesty International in 2012, there were more than 600 craters caused by artillery fire in the small town of Anadan, four miles from second city Aleppo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>An estimated 200,000 people have now been killed and an estimated nine million Syrians have fled their homes since the outbreak of the war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Dr Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in New York, said: 'We're not saying the drought caused the war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'We're saying that added to all the other stressors, it helped kick things over the threshold into open conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said that the 2006-2010 drought was the worst and longest on record compared to those in the 1950s, 1980s and 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Particularly hard hit was the Fertile Crescent that spans Syria, Turkey and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Since 1900 the area has undergone warming of between 1 degree C and 1.2 degrees C and rainfall in the wet season has fallen by 10 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The researchers said the trend matched that predicted by models of climate change caused by human carbon dioxide emissions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They said that the wind patterns bringing rain from the Mediterranean weakened while higher temperatures caused greater evaporation of moisture from the soils during the summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The drought was so severe that the Euphrates river in the city of Raqqa, eastern Syria receded to the point shown above in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Previous water levels can be seen clearly on the observation tower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>This caused agricultural production to plunge by a third in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Combined with a growing population - from four million in the 1950s to 22 million now - this led to increasing levels of poverty and pressure within the country's urban areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The researchers said that Bashar Hafez al-Assad's regime also encouraged water intensive crops like cotton for export while illegal drilling of irrigation wells rapidly depleted groundwater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In the worst hit north east areas of the country, livestock herds were practically obliterated, cereal prices doubled and nutrition-related diseases among children increased dramatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Shahrzad Mohtadi, a student at the school of international and public affairs at Columbia University who also took part in the research, said that this led to 1.5 million people moving from the countryside to the cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Writing in the journal, the authors said: 'Rapid demographic change encourages instability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It is the first study of its kind to look at how climate change has played a role in a current war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Professor Solomon Hsaing, a public policy researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, said similar climatic changes had triggered the collapse of the Akkadian Empire in the region 4,200 years ago following a drought lasting several years.</td></tr>
