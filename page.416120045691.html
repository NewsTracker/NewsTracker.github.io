<h3>Fraser-Holmes succumbs to swim pressure</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Gutted former world No.1 Thomas Fraser-Holmes admits he couldn't handle the expectation at the national swimming championships in Sydney after a breakthrough 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fraser-Holmes has one last chance to impress in the 400m individual medley final on Friday night - the eight day titles' last evening of action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Fraser-Holmes on Friday clocked four minutes, 23.49 seconds to be fifth fastest for the final - well behind top qualifier Travis Mahoney (4:20.76).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gold Coast's Fraser-Holmes, 23, arrived at the nationals as one of the swimmers to watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He was 200m freestyle world No.1 last year, claiming the Commonwealth Games and Pan Pacs titles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But alarm bells were ringing when Fraser-Holmes remarkably failed to earn a 200m world titles berth after finishing a distant third in the national final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He also came third in the 200m IM final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>All Fraser-Holmes has to show for the titles to date is a 4x200m freestyle relay berth for July's world titles in Kazan, Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Things didn't go how I wanted them on my first day and in swimming it's pretty easy for things to snowball," a shattered Fraser-Holmes said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Maybe the pressure got to me, being No.1 last year and coming back here with that expectation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Fraser-Holmes was still getting his head around missing out on the 200m at the world titles where he was tipped to win gold based on 2014 form.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Besides the 4x200m relay spot, selectors' discretionary powers may yet grant Fraser-Holmes a nod in the 200m IM and 400m IM events at Kazan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I have to accept I am not swimming the 200m at worlds," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Meanwhile, Keryn McMaster (4:44.99) was fastest qualifier for Friday night's women's 400m IM final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mack Horton is tipped to shatter Grant Hackett's 16-year-old 18 age group record in the 1500m freestyle final on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In the other finals on the last night are Cate Campbell (50m freestyle), Sally Hunter (50m breaststroke) and Ben Treffers (50m backstroke).</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Australia's 2015 world titles team - renamed the Dolphins - will be confirmed on Friday night.</td></tr>
