<h3>Eleven handed life sentences over Guinea Ebola worker murders</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CONAKRY (Reuters) - A court in Guinea has sentenced 11 people to life in prison for murdering a team educating locals about the risks of Ebola in a remote part of the West African country last year, a state prosecutor said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bodies of eight people were discovered in September in Womey, a village near the city of Nzerekore around 1,000 km (620 miles) southeast of the capital Conakry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some had been hacked to death with machetes or had their throats slit before their bodies were thrown into latrines, witnesses at the trial in Nzerekore said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There were 26 defendants. Among them, a group consisting of 11 was sentenced to life in prison," said prosecutor William Fernandez, who had requested the death penalty for charges including murder and conspiracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The other 15 defendants were found innocent and released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The victims, who had come under attack by a stone-throwing mob in Womey before their murder, included local administrators, two medical officers, a pastor and three journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Since the Ebola virus first appeared in the forests of Guinea over a year ago, it has killed more than 10,000 people in Guinea and neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia in the worst epidemic of the disease on record.</td></tr>
