<tr><td>4</td><td>The 25-year-old African American died from a severed spine on April 19, a week after he was arrested by Baltimore police and transported by van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Police are investigating how Gray, who was cuffed with his hands behind his back and his legs in irons, was injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The police findings into the death, which has led to days of protests and a fevered Monday night of rioting and looting, were scheduled to be completed by Friday, but were completed early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The state's attorney has the final say on whether to charge any of the six officers with a state crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The officers have been suspended with pay.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>Eric Kowalczyk said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Police have already acknowledged that department policy was breached when Gray was placed in the van but not buckled into a seat belt and when officers failed to get him medical care in a timely fashion.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>The Post quoted from what it said was a Baltimore police document that was included in an application for a search warrant, which is sealed by the court.</td></tr>
