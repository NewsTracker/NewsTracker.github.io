<h3>Egypt court confirms death sentence for Brotherhood chief, 11 others</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Judge Mohamed Nagy Shehata also sentenced to death two Islamists who have fled the country, and handed life terms to 23 detained defendants.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>Among those sentenced to life in prison was Mohamed Soltan, a US-Egyptian citizen who is on hunger strike.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>The sentencings can be appealed before the Court of Cassation, which has overturned dozens of other death sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Shehata, who has sentenced dozens of Islamists to death in other cases, read out a Koranic verse that stipulates amputation and crucifixion for outlaws, before rendering his verdict on Saturday.</td></tr>
