<h3>Parliament inquiry criticizes UK, EU of 'sleepwalking' into Ukraine crisis, misjudging Russia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>IN a report published Friday, the House of Lords' EU Committee said it found a "catastrophic misreading" of mood by Europe ahead of the standoff between Russia and Western countries over Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The committee said Britain "has not been as active or as visible as it could have been" in trying to resolve the crisis, and that foreign ministries in Britain and other European countries were poorly equipped to draw up an "authoritative response."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It also said that for too long the EU had been optimistic about Russia's democratic development, and as a result Europe failed to realize the depth of Russian hostility when the EU opened talks on Ukraine in 2013.</td></tr>
