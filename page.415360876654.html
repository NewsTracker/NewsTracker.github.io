<h3>Sir Richard Branson pleads for lives of Bali nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran and other drug convicts on death row</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sir Richard adds his voice to calls for clemency for Bali 9 members Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sir Richard Branson has written a letter to Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, pleading with him to spare the lives of the Bali nine ringleaders and the other death-row prisoners who are awaiting execution by firing squad for drug offences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Virgin founder, who is a commissioner for the Global Commission on Drug Policy, said he was prepared to "get on a plane tomorrow" to make a last-ditch plea for clemency for Andrew Chan, Myuran Sukumaran and the others who are due to be executed on Nusakambangan island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Plea: Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a letter to Mr Joko, Sir Richard described the death penalty as an "inhumane form of punishment that has been proven time and again to fail as a deterrent of crime".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Countries that still carry out executions for drug offences have not seen any significant shifts in supply and demand. The drug trade remains remarkably unaffected by the threat of capital punishment," the letter reads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Furthermore, the death penalty removes any chance of forgiveness for the remorseful. It is our understanding that several of the defendants, many still in early adulthood when convicted, have expressed enormous regret for their offences and resolved to live better, more purposeful lives."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Seven foreign death row prisoners in Indonesia await execution by firing squad in Nusakambangan prison island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Top row from left, Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, Frenchman Serge Atlaoui and Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Bottom row from left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, Filipina Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, and Nigerian Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The letter, which was signed by Sir Richard and two other members of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Ruth Dreifuss, says their organisation has the highest consideration for Indonesian law and Mr Joko's responsibility to keep his country safe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"However, as advocates of evidence-based drug policy reform, we have studied different national approaches in great depth," the letter continues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We have learnt that treating drugs as a health issue and not as a criminal one, helps lower the number of drug deaths, limits the spread of infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS or hepatitis, reduces drug-related crime and allows people who struggle with addiction to become useful members of society again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Awaiting execution: Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"If you were to find it helpful, we would be happy to come to Indonesia to discuss the issue with you and your administration."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Pressure: Indonesian President Joko Widodo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The letter, posted on the Virgin website, includes a link to a petition calling for an immediate end to executions in Indonesia for those convicted of drug offences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Sir Richard told the ABC that he was willing to "get on a plane today, tomorrow, as are the other commissioners", if it would sway Mr Joko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The letter comes as the Australian government's repeated pleas to halt the prisoners' executions are met with hostility in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>An Indonesian minister, Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno, warned in a television interview this week that Indonesia could release 10,000 asylum seekers to Australia if Canberra continues to antagonise his country over the execution of the Bali nine duo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"If Canberra keeps doing things that displease Indonesia, Jakarta will surely let the illegal immigrants go to Australia," Mr Tedjo said on Metro TV.</td></tr>
