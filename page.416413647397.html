<h3>Greek Anger Over State Cash Grab From Public Entities</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greek local authorities were on the brink of revolt Tuesday against the central government's move to use cash reserves from state agencies - including hospitals and kindergartens - to help the country make ends meet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At an emergency meeting in Athens, angry mayors voted to defy the order to have spare reserves put in a central bank account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They also agreed to stage protests and take "every possible political and legal action" against the radical left-led government over its decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Not a single municipality should deposit even one euro at the Bank of Greece," said Ioannis Lolos, mayor of the northwestern town of Igoumenitsa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Citing an "extremely urgent and unforeseen" need for cash, an emergency government decree Monday rendered funds from state entities - such as the national opera, the national art gallery and even hospitals and kindergartens - available for short-term loans to the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The move, unprecedented in recent Greek history, is the latest sign that the country is running perilously short of cash amid an impasse in bailout talks with its international creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Until it reaches an agreement with its creditors from the 19-country eurozone and the International Monetary Fund, Greece will not get a badly-needed 7.2 billion euros ($7.7 billion) in rescue funds, without which Athens will be unable to meet loan obligations this summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A senior European Union official said Tuesday that reform talks are "where ideally I think we would have wanted to find ourselves two months ago."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Eurozone members had agreed that Greece should finalize its reform plans by the end of this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Their finance ministers, known as the eurogroup, want to assess progress at a meeting in Latvia on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But technical talks aimed at establishing what those reforms are have borne little fruit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The senior official said there has been "a clear pick-up in engagement but we are a significant way from being able to signal that a result is in sight."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The official works closely with the eurogroup but is not allowed to speak publicly about its procedures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis voiced confidence that an agreement will be eventually reached, saying there is "clear convergence" in the negotiations and that "a non-agreement would be disastrous for all of us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"This doesn't mean that there will necessarily be a solution during Friday's eurogroup ... but I think it will be a very important step toward concluding the negotiations," he told reporters in Athens Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Asked about Greece's cash crunch, Varoufakis insisted that he is not in a tearing hurry to receive the frozen rescue loan payment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"This government doesn't set the next installment above everything," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"What we do consider paramount is to obtain an agreement that will truly stabilize the economy, once and for all, and kick off the growth process."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will meet Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany - a major provider of rescue loans and staunch proponent of Greek austerity - on the sidelines of Thursday's EU summit in Brussels on migration, his office said.</td></tr>
