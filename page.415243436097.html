<h3>Emirates forges special relationship with el-Sissi's Egypt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The United Arab Emirates has pumped billions of dollars into Egypt and is lining up investors to try to stabilize its damaged economy, while building military cooperation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In their deepening relationship, an economically exhausted Egypt benefits from the UAE's finances, and the U.S.-allied Emirates gets a heavyweight with extensive manpower on its side in a region deeply unstable with threats of militant violence and Iranian expansion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We are among the vanguards calling for stability in Egypt, whose security represents a cornerstone of Arab world security," Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan told a full house during his speech at a governance conference held in Dubai last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We cannot keep our fingers crossed about achieving stability and development in Egypt."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That conference put the UAE-Egypt relationship front and center among the 80 nations attending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A slick, museum-worthy display outside the vast conference hall spotlighted the countries' close ties, declaring in a logo, "Among its many brotherly neighbors, Egypt holds a special place with the United Arab Emirates."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Egypt's prime minister, Ibrahim Mahlab, had a prime speaking spot, which he used to praise the Emirates' "wise leadership" and the two nations' friendship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Emirates is also a key organizer of an economic development conference aimed at enticing investors to Egypt and reviving its economy, to be held next week in the Sinai resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Egypt the Future investment conference's speakers list presents a who's who of the Emirati corporate elite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Executives from Western blue-chip names like General Electric and Coca Cola will share the stage with UAE-based heads of telecom Etisalat Group, private equity firm Abraaj Capital, and the real estate developer behind the world's tallest skyscraper, Emaar Properties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Executives from the Gulf nation's aviation, banking and energy industries will be there too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Emirati construction giant Arabtec Holding has ambitious plans for a $40 billion project to build 1 million middle-income homes across Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It has said the project will create more than a million jobs in Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Arabtec helped raise Dubai's record-breaking Burj Khalifa skyscraper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Its biggest shareholder is Aabar Investments, which is controlled by the government of the oil-rich Emirati capital, Abu Dhabi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Minister of State Sultan al-Jaber, an Emirati official with one of the few seats on the conference's steering committee, promised the event will be "a first step in the implementation of a larger strategy that will ensure Egypt's economic revival."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Egypt's economy has been gutted by turmoil since the 2011 uprising that ousted autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Foreign investment and tourism revenues dried up, depleting foreign currency reserves and driving up unemployment, and frequent rounds of violence in the country have frustrated attempts to rebuild.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait pumped billions of dollars into Egypt following the military's ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in July 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Like Saudi Arabia and new Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, the Emirates sees Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood as a threat and moved aggressively to stamp out sympathizers of the group in the wake of the Arab Spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It followed Cairo's and Riyadh's lead in branding the group a terrorist organization in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A UAE government report shows that Egypt is by far the biggest single recipient of donor cash from the Emirates, with $4.6 billion distributed just in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Egypt's aid share was 29 times more than that of the next largest recipient, Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In addition to providing direct cash aid, the OPEC member has been building schools, clinics, wheat silos and tens of thousands of homes as part of at least $10 billion earmarked for Egypt since Morsi's ouster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In October 2013 it opened a hospital named after the federation's founder, Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan, in the Manshiyat Nasser slum on the outskirts of Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In contrast, before Morsi's fall, Egypt had been in talks for several years with the International Monetary Fund for a $4.8 billion loan, but the talks never reached a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>For Egypt, the benefit of an enthusiastic, deep-pocketed patron is obvious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But the Emirates stands to gain, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The seven-state federation sees Egypt as central to regional security given its location, the size of its population and its outsize historical and cultural role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>As the Arab world's second biggest economy " after Saudi Arabia " the Emirates has plenty to spend on its defense budget and boasts one of the region's best-equipped militaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>What it doesn't have is Egypt's manpower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The UAE is home to only about 9 million people, fewer than one in five of them citizens with the foreign workers and their families making up the rest " compared to Egypt's 90 million people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Egypt is the No. 1 strategic partner for the UAE outside the Gulf itself. It's partly because they share a very similar vision for the region, and a very similar threat perception," said Jane Kinninmont, a Middle East expert at British think tank Chatham House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Their defense and security establishments really see eye to eye," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Muslim Brotherhood concerns have brought them closer together."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The growing ties were on display in a series of bilateral military exercises last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Photos released following one set of drills showed el-Sissi, clad in fatigues, peering off the deck of a warship, with Emirati Prime Minister Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and Abu Dhabi's powerful crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, at his side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The training may well have paid off when, according to American officials, the two nations teamed up in August to bomb Islamic militants in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Egyptian officials have said Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and UAE were in talks late last year over creating a military pact to face militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Now el-Sissi is looking to formalize the bonds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Last week, in the wake of the beheading in Libya of a group of Egyptian Christians by Islamic State militants, the soldier-turned-politician called for the creation of a joint Arab military force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Two countries, he added, had separately offered to deploy military forces to help Egypt: Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.</td></tr>
