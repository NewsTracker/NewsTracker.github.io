<h3>Edward Snowden's lawyer is working with the United States on his return home</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Russian lawyer for Snowden said on Tuesday the fugitive former U.S. spy agency contractor who leaked details of the government's mass surveillance programs was working with American and German lawyers to return home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His biggest demand it seems is that he be given a fair trial when charged for his offenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>'I won't keep it secret that he... wants to return back home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And we are doing everything possible now to solve this issue,' said his lawyer Anatoly Kucherena while speaking at a news conference about a book he had written on Snowden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Moscow granted Snowden asylum in 2013, and he has been given a three-year residence permit in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This at a time when relations between the two countries are already strained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The United States wants Snowden to stand trial for leaking extensive secrets of electronic surveillance programs by the National Security Agency, but Russia has repeatedly refused to extradite him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He has been charged with theft of government property and two counts of violating the 1917 Espionage Act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And while the government is eager to have Snowden see his day in court, public support for the 31-year-old may be at an all time high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Just last week the documentary Citzenfour, which examined the leaking of these classified documents by Snowden to journalist Glenn Greenwald, and his quest for asylum in the aftermath, took home the Oscar for Best Documentary at the Academy Awards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Snowden's girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, was there to accept the award alongside Greenwald and the film's director, Laura Poitras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He was also interviewed by New York Times media columnist David Carr in the esteemed journalist's last ever public appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In a recent Reddit AMA, Snowden said that through this all his biggest regret is that he did not come forward with these leaks sooner, believing that if he had he might have limited some of the government's abuse of their powers.</td></tr>

<h3>Man convicted in fatal New Delhi gang rape blames victim in new film</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Leslee Udwin's "India's Daughter" features conversations with Mukesh Singh and fellow convicts who raped and tortured a 23-year-old woman on a moving bus in December 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Home Minister Rajnath Singh said the documentary would not be aired in India and accused its makers of violating "permission conditions" by not showing the complete unedited footage to jail officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It was noticed the documentary film depicts the comments of the convict which are highly derogatory and are an affront to the dignity of women," Singh told lawmakers in parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"How was permission given to interview a rapist? It is shocking. I will get this investigated."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Comments released to the media this week showed that in the film, Mukesh blames the victim for the crime and resisting rape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He also says women are more responsible than men for rape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"You can't clap with one hand - it takes two hands," he says in the film, according to a statement by the filmmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"A decent girl won't roam around at nine o'clock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy ... Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things. About 20% of girls are good."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Late on Tuesday, the home minister directed Delhi police to obtain a court order prohibiting the film's release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Police said the ban was imposed as Mukesh's comments created an atmosphere of "fear and tension" and risked fuelling public anger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Udwin, a rape victim herself, said she was "deeply saddened" by the decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I urge (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi to deal with this unceremonious silencing of the film," she wrote in a statement published by Indian channel NDTV, which was to have aired the documentary on March 8, International Women's Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>NDTV also reproduced letters showing Udwin had obtained permission from the home ministry prior to carrying out the interviews, and had the consent of Mukesh in Tihar jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Udwin told reporters on Tuesday she had given jail officials a chance to sit through hours of unedited footage, but they did not do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Officials later approved a pared-down version, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The British filmmaker, who worked on the film for two years and was inspired to make it after watching thousands of people take to the streets across India in protest over the 2012 rape, said it would be released worldwide as planned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>India toughened its anti-rape laws in response to the outcry following the 2012 attack, but a rape is still reported on average every 21 minutes in India, and acid attacks, domestic violence and molestation are common.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mukesh's comments in "India's Daughter" have grabbed headlines in Indian newspapers and sparked outrage on social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Some people have questioned whether the convicts should have been given a forum to express their views.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Wednesday, the issue was debated in parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Four men including Mukesh were sentenced to death for the crime, but their execution was later stayed on appeal by India's Supreme Court.</td></tr>
