<h3>France will resist ban on smacking children despite pressure</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>On Wednesday, the Council of Europe in Strasbourg is due to condemn France's vague laws regarding corporal punishment for children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It's expected to rule that French law on the issue is not "sufficiently clear, binding or precise," Le Monde reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Strasbourg court was forced to take action after a complaint lodged by the British charity Approach, which said that French law violates the European Social Charter, a treaty adopted by the Council of Europe in 1961.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"France has voluntarily signed up to this social charter and made a binding legal commitment to stick to its provisions. If there is a violation found, France has an obligation to put it right, and the European Committee of Social Rights will follow up to make sure steps are taken in the right direction," Andrew Cutting, a spokesperson for the council, told the Local.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Europe's top human rights court wants the smacking of children banned right across the continent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It says that spanking kids is "ineffective, conveys the wrong message, and can cause serious physical and mental harm" and is a "violation of their human rights."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Their campaign, called 'Raise your Hand Against Smacking' aims to ban it in all 47 member states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>So far, 22 have an outright ban with six committed to follow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the French government looks like they will try and stall the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There were several attempts last year by ministers and activists in France to get a change in the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In May, a smacking ban was postponed indefinitely after lawmakers refused to debate the bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The politicians lack courage. They are scared of the protests if they change the law," Olivier Maurel, founder of the anti-corporal punishment organization Oveo, told the Local.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>France does ban violence towards children, but also gives parents the "right to discipline" them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Laurence Rossignol, France's family minister has said she doesn't think legislation on the matter is necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We don't need a law, but we do need to collectively consider the usefulness of corporal punishment in bringing up children. The evolution of a society and its social developments are not suddenly brought about by a change in law," she told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But previously she has said that "children are the only living beings that can be hit, but where nobody will intervene."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She also said that she is in favor of the "promotion of violence-free education" and that it's important to "make parents aware that corporal punishment is not trivial."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But there could be more cynical reasons for her mixed messages on the subject of smacking children, as the government is wary of stirring up public opinion by a controversial change in family law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I do not want to cut the country in two camps, those who are in favor for spanking and those who are against," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>An expert on children and punishment, Gilles Lazimi from the Foundation for Childhood, said that over half French parents and grandparents admit to smacking children under the age of two, while 85 percent said they had smacked children in their care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The French government is acting in the interests of the adults and not of the children. It's scandalous," he told the Local.</td></tr>

<h3>Petraeus OKs guilty plea in data leak to mistress</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>David Petraeus, the former CIA director and top Army general whose affair with his biographer brought down what many considered a bright political future, has agreed to plead guilty to mishandling classified materials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The plea agreement was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Charlotte, North Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Petraeus was charged with one count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, which carries a possible penalty of up to a year in prison, $100,000 fine and five years of probation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Since 2013, Petraeus has held a senior position at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We look forward to working with him as he continues to add value as Chairman of the KKR Global Institute," the private equity firm said in a statement Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The case was filed in Charlotte, the hometown of Paula Broadwell, the general's biographer and former mistress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>According to court documents, Petraeus gave Broadwell binders of classified material from Afghanistan while she was writing her book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The binders were known as "black books" and were seized by the FBI in a search of Petraeus home, according to court documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He also lied about providing them to Broadwell, according to court documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There were eight binders in all, each containing classified information about Petraeus' time as the top general in Afghanistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The material included his daily schedule and notes he took during official briefings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The books were top secret and also included notes about Petraeus' discussions with the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Petraeus retained the black books in his home even after he left the Defense Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Aug. 28, 2011, he delivered them to a private residence in Washington where Broadwell was staying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Petraeus left the books with her so she could use them as source material for the biography on Petraeus that she wrote, which was released in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>1, Petraeus brought the books back to his home in Arlington, Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>When Petraeus resigned from the CIA, he signed a security exit form indicating he had no classified material in his possession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>However, he still had the black books in his home at that time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On April 5, 2013, the FBI searched his home and seized the black books from an unlocked desk drawer in a first-floor study.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>When interviewed by the FBI in 2012, Petraeus said he never provided classified information to his biographer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Prosecutors say that was false, and that Petraeus lied to federal investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Petraeus' lawyers David Kendall and Robert Barnett in Washington declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>CORRECTION: This updates an earlier version by Reuters to correct that Petraeus has agreed to plead guilty but has not actually done so.</td></tr>
