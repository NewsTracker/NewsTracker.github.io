<h3>Ukraine marks 29 years since Chernobyl disaster</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The explosion of reactor number four on April 26, 1986, spewed poisonous radiation over large parts of Europe, particularly Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>SLAVUTYCH (Ukraine): Ukrainians have marked 29 years since the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, placing wreaths and candles near the plant where work to lay a new seal over the reactor site has been delayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At 1:23 am (local time), the exact time of the explosion, hundreds of people placed flowers and candles in the dark yesterday, at the foot of a monument in Slavutych, a town 50 kilometres from the plant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Slavutych was built to rehouse Chernobyl workers who had lived near the plant and were forced to move further away after the disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the site of the plant itself, around 100 kilometres from Kiev, Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko laid a wreath at a monument to the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The human toll of the disaster is still disputed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>United Nations experts officially recognised 31 deaths among plant workers and firefighters directly linked to the blast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But environmental group Greenpeace has suggested there would be around 100,000 additional cancer deaths caused by the disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Soviet authorities of the time dispatched hundreds of thousands of people to put out the fire and clean the site, without proper protection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They hastily laid over the reactor site a concrete cover dubbed "the sarcophagus", which is now cracking and must be replaced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in statement: "We stand in solidarity with the millions who have been traumatised by lingering fears about their health and livelihoods".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The UN Action Plan on Chernobyl will come to an end on December 31 and so UN officials have initiated a series of consultations "to define the vision for post-2016 international cooperation", it added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ban called for "a forward-looking strategy designed to further help the recovery of the affected areas and to work together for greater nuclear safety worldwide."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Poroshenko yesterday inspected ongoing work on a new 20,000-tonne steel cover - a project estimated to cost more than two billion euros ($2.2 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It is financed by international donations managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The structure will contain technology that will act beneath the cover to decontaminate the area once the steel layer is in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Officials say the new cover will last for 100 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ukrainians have marked 29 years since the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, placing wreaths and candles near the plant where work to lay a new seal over the reactor site has been delayed.</td></tr>
