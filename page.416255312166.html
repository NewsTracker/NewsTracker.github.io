<h3>Hillary Clinton's father's tombstone toppled</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The toppled headstone of Hugh Rodham was discovered Monday and has since been put back up, the station says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It is in the Washburn Street Cemetery, Scranton's Times-Tribune reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Investigators are treating the incident as suspicious, especially since it came just after Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy for president, WYOU says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Scranton Police Chief Carl Graziano told the newspaper it appears to be a case of vandalism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I'm not sure how else it would have fallen over," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Caretaker Paul McGloin remarked to the Times-Tribune, "I hope this had nothing to do with politics, because that's just wrong."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Graziano told WYOU a man was taken from the cemetery Monday for a mental health evaluation, but authorities can't directly link him to the overturned headstone.</td></tr>
