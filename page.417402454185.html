<h3>Woman tosses Apple computer that turns out to be worth $200K</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A recycling center in the Silicon Valley is looking for a woman who dropped off an old Apple computer that turned out to be a collectible item worth $200,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The computer was inside boxes of electronics that she had cleaned out from her garage after her husband died, said Victor Gichun, the vice president of Clean Bay Area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She didn't want a tax receipt or leave her contact information, and it wasn't until a few weeks later that workers opened the boxes to discover an Apple I computer inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The San Jose Mercury News reports (http://bayareane.ws/1QiwrkE) it was one of only about 200 first-generation desktop computers assembled by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ron Wayne in 1976.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We really couldn't believe our eyes. We thought it was fake," Gichun told KNTV-TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The recycling firm sold the Apple I for $200,000 to a private collection, and because the company gives 50 percent of items sold back to the original owner, Gichun said he wants to split the proceeds with the mystery donor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said he remembers what she looks like and is asking her to come back to claim her $100,000 check.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"To prove who she is," Gichun said, "I just need to look at her."</td></tr>
