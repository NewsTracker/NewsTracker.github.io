<h3>Tunisian authorities hunt accomplices of gunman</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Investigators are searching for one or more accomplices in an attack on a luxury hotel in a Tunisian beach resort that killed at least 38 people, some of them sunbathers on the beach, an official said today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The father and three roommates of the attacker were detained and being questioned in the capital, Tunis, Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The attacker has been identified as Seifeddine Rezgui, a 24-year-old graduate of Tunisia's Kairouan University where he had been living with the other students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We are sure that others helped, but did not participate," Aroui said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"They participated indirectly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A security official close to the investigation confirmed news reports indicating that a swimmer had found the attacker's cellphone in the Mediterranean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The phone showed the attacker spoke with his father just before his assault, the official said on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Authorities believe the suspected accomplices provided the Kalashnikov assault rifle to Rezgui and helped him get to the scene, Aroui said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ballistic tests showed the bullets came from that single weapon, and the attacker was carrying four cartridges of ammunition - all were found by investigators, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Shortly after the shooting spree, Aroui had initially said that two people were involved in the attack before backtracking on that assertion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>To some, the long duration of the assault - reportedly lasting nearly 30 minutes - and the high casualty count might indicate that more than one gunman was involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The attacker methodically moved from the beach to the hotel's swimming pool, reception and other areas in a massacre that stands as Tunisia's worst terror attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The death toll surpassed the 22 people killed in March at The National Bardo Museum outside Tunis - again mostly tourists in a country known for its beaches and rich history.</td></tr>
