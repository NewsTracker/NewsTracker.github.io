<h3>UEFA: Block on Russia-Ukraine draw could be lifted for Euros</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>UEFA executive committee member Frantisek Laurinec of Slovakia told The Associated Press on Sunday he believes the two countries could play "in a neutral field like in France."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After Russia annexed the Crimea region from Ukraine last March, UEFA decided in July to separate their national and clubs teams in all continental competition draws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A ceasefire negotiated last month has calmed conflict in eastern Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Euro 2016 tournament groups are drawn Dec. 12 in Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Russia and Ukraine are both currently third in their qualifying groups after playing four of 10 matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The top two in each group qualifies and third place earns at least a playoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"If both teams would be qualified, I don't see any problem to play in the same group," Laurinec said on the sidelines of a UEFA executive committee meeting attended by Russian and Ukrainian delegates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The UEFA draw ruling has had most effect in the Europa League, with two clubs from Ukraine and one from Russia reaching the quarterfinals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Dynamo Kiev or Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk could yet advance to play Zenit St. Petersburg in the final on May 27 in Warsaw, Poland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>UEFA has stepped in to help administer and rebuild football in Crimea and resolve tense relations between the Russian and Ukrainian football federations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After last season ended, two Ukrainian Premier League clubs in Crimea were shut down and three new teams created to play in Russian leagues and cup competitions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Ukraine federation protested and suggested Russia's hosting of the 2018 World Cup should be threatened by FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>UEFA eventually banned Crimean clubs from playing in the Russian league system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Laurinec was appointed by UEFA in December to oversee a transition to creating a Crimean regional league and funding youth development.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It is not an easy task. We visited the Crimea. The infrastructure is very poor, financing is very problematic," Laurinec said Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"But we will do everything to support this idea because you must have also the senior competitions. Otherwise the motivation of young people to play football is very low."</td></tr>
