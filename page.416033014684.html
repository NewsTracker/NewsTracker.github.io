<h3>Kenya attack victims had big plans for life</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But Bryson Mwakuleghwa, a 21-year-old student at Garissa University College in Kenya, never had the chance to make his dreams happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mwakuleghwa was among 148 people who were killed in an attack by Islamic militants Thursday on the college in Garissa, near the border with Somalia, where the al-Shabab extremist group is based.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On Monday, relatives of the dead converged on a funeral parlor in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, for the grim task of identifying the dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some grieved quietly, while others emerged from viewing bodies of lost family members in physical distress, wailing as Red Cross officials escorted and even carried them to tents for counseling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Several mourners interviewed by The Associated Press outside the Chiromo Funeral Parlour of the University of Nairobi spoke wistfully of those they lost, sometimes using the same words - humble, devout, studious and a role model - to describe youths who were trying hard to forge a career, leaving home and traveling many hours by bus to Garissa to take advantage of the education opportunities there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I knew Bryson as a young man who grew up in the church" and performed in its choir, said his guardian, Ginton Mwachofi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The young man's death hit hard in Taita-Taveta, the coastal county where he grew up, Mwachofi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It was a big blow for the people of Taita-Taveta because we don't have enough people studying in university," said the guardian, who also coached the youth in soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They can't believe that Bryson is no more."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mwakuleghwa, who was studying education, was a stoic who rarely revealed whether he was happy or sad, hungry or thirsty, Mwachofi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Four gunmen died in Thursday's attack after security forces entered the campus to stop the slaughter of the students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Survivors said the gunmen targeted Christians and said they would spare Muslims and women, though there were numerous accounts of indiscriminate shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Virginia Simiyu, who was 24 years old when she died in the attack, was a long-distance runner on her high school team, a leader of a Christian group at the Garissa college and was "born to be nice," said her aunt, Phyllis Wabuke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Simiyu, a student of "human resource management," was also a role model to her three younger siblings and promised her mother that she would help lift the family out of poverty once she got a job, Wabuke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"'Mama, I'll build you a house,'" Wabuke quoted Simiyu as telling her mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Now Simiyu's mother is "broken down" with grief and "is not in a state of mind that would recognize anything now," Wabuke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The mother is sometimes tied down with ropes to control her hysteria and is being counseled by professional helpers, she said.</td></tr>
