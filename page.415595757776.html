<h3>New law will open access to adoptees' birth certificates</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Individuals adopted between January 1, 1964, and September 18, 1996, began requesting the information Friday from the Ohio Department of Health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The new law is expected to give about 400,000 people access to records which had been largely blocked without a court order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dozens of people braved cold temperatures and rain to line up outside the state vital statistics bureau first thing Friday to apply in person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Results come in about a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I have been waiting for so long to find out my history, who I originated from," said Dorothy Johnson, 48, a Youngstown police officer, as she shuffled along in line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She's hoping to learn the identity of her mother, who she's been told was 13 when she had Johnson in 1966.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Concerned that adoption records were open to anyone, lawmakers put them off limits in 1964, including to adult adoptees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Following lobbying from adoptees and their advocates, lawmakers made the records public again in 1996.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>People adopted in all other years already had access to the records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the law was not made retroactive for those caught between the two laws because of pressure from groups, including abortion opponents who feared it would discourage people considering adoption, said Betsie Norris, executive director and founder of Adoption Network Cleveland, and an adoptee who led the fight to change the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The law that took effect Friday finally opens the records for those 1964-1996 adoptees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It also gives birth parents the ability to say whether they want to be contacted, and allows birth parents to update their medical information through the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's about adoptees having the civil right to information that all other Americans can have about themselves," Norris said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It's a social justice issue."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ohio is the ninth state to make all its records available to adoptees, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Under the law, birth parents who placed a child for adoption between 1964 and 1996 had a one-year period to request that their names be redacted from the birth-certificate information that would be released to the adult adoptee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Adoptee Sarah Bear says her priority is getting information about her family's medical history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Her children, a 19-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son, only have half that history now, said Bear of Westerville in suburban Columbus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She planned to be at the state Department of Vital Statistics first thing Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Beyond the medical information, she's curious about her heritage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Bear, 37, grew up in Lima and is close to her adopted family, which supports her efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"My adopted family is very German, so my way of thinking is along those lines, but it would be nice to know what is in my blood," said Bear, 37, an instructional designer at Ohio State.</td></tr>

<h3>Relations with US strained as Netanyahu seizes power</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Benjamin Netanyahu won Israel, but at what cost?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The racist dog-whistle of his election-day Facebook video post warning right-wing voters of a high Arab turnout at the ballot box was ugly, but it had none of the diplomatic weight of his open denunciation of a two-state solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>His already fractious relationship with the United States, Israel's most important ally, was further threatened by his promise that a Palestinian state would never happen if he was re-elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu touches the Western Wall in Jerusalem, after winning the general election on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Trailing in the polls in the dying days of the election, his threats over Israel's borders and Arab voters drew a last-minute surge of support to his right-wing Likud party and he is now in talks with other right-wing party leaders over the formation of a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The diplomatic fallout was swift.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Already the US is hinting that it might support a United Nations Security Council resolution that recognises Palestine along pre-1967 borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Until now it has repeatedly refused to endorse the resolution and Israel has always been opposed to it, insisting that only negotiations can bring about a lasting peace and agreed borders, but a US official has told The New York Times that Washington is "in a reality where the Israeli government no longer supports direct negotiations. Therefore we clearly have to factor that into our decisions".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with his son, Yair, in Jerusalem on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Despite maintaining a public position of support for a two-state solution, Mr Netanyahu had consistently proven he was committed to eroding any possibility of a peace deal by continuing with his program of settlement expansion, considered illegal under international law, in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In 2009, Mr Netanyahu made what was considered a game-changing speech at Bar-Ilan University in which he committed to the idea of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Facing the prospect of defeat after three terms in government, he disavowed that commitment earlier this week and by the time vote counting had ended, his Likud party had won 30 seats and was almost guaranteed to form a governing coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Political leaders in Britain were less than impressed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg described Mr Netanyahu's comments as "extremely worrying".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Copies of ballot papers and campaign posters for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party abandoned after the nation's elections on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It cannot be more alarming - to have [Mr Netanyahu] do something which no leading Israeli politician has ever done - to rule out the prospect of a two-state solution," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Summing up the week in Israeli politics, Haaretz columnist Gideon Levy said: "They voted for the man who admitted to having duped half the world during his Bar-Ilan speech. Now he has torn off his mask and disavowed those words once and for all. Israel said `yes' to the man who said `no' to a Palestinian state."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I don't think the Europeans were falling off their chairs in shock that Netanyahu might not be as committed to a two-state solution as his 2009 Bar-Ilan speech suggested he was," says Daniel Levy, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A Palestinian woman reads about the Israeli election result in Gaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"No one has been taking seriously the idea that you will get a two-state solution under Netanyahu, but if you can maintain the pretence, if the Palestinians are willing to maintain it, if the US and the EU are willing to maintain it, then it can be business as usual."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Much will depend on how the Palestinian side reacts to his inflammatory statements, Levy says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Netanyahu can "walk this back" and explain it away as something that was said in the heat of an election campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Already it seems the Israeli prime minister is trying to do just that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In an interview with MSNBC television channel on Thursday, he said: "I don't want a one-state solution. I want a sustainable, peaceful two-state solution, but for that circumstances have to change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to deliver a speech after winning the election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"We need the conditions of recognition of a Jewish state and real security in order to have a realistic two-state solution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Despite their distaste at his statements disavowing a two-state solution, "the Europeans are not chomping at the bit to sanction Israel", Levy says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"But Netanyahu is pressing down on the accelerator on this issue . . . in the short term the fallout will be less dramatic than some expect, but it will play out over time and by then it will almost certainly be too late to salvage the idea of two states."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A key element is the weakness in the Palestinian leadership, Levy says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"The Palestinians could remain divided, they could muddle along in this situation for years, but . . . the other game changer could be that Israel might try to pre-emptively shake up the Palestinian leadership."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The tactics Mr Netanyahu used to get elected - coming out against a Palestinian state - will have far-reaching consequences on Israel's standing in the international community, warns Daniel Seidemann, political commentator and an expert on Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"There are people who only recently have heard the opposite from him - US Secretary of State John Kerry, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, for example - and I believe that tactics that Netanyahu used to get re-elected will haunt us for a long time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Netanyahu plays on Israeli fears and anxieties the way the virtuoso plays on a Stradivarius," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>For Palestinians, Mr Netanyahu's statements are simply a confirmation of what has been the reality for many years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Israel has continued with its aggressive program of settlement construction, while insisting it has no partner in the peace talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said a two-state solution was impossible with a new government led by Mr Netanyahu, but said he was willing to negotiate with any government that accepted two states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"The results of the Israeli elections are the natural outcome of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies throughout his previous tenures of generating fear, hostility and distrust, as well as shifting the whole terrain of political discourse to the racist extreme," says Palestine Liberation Organisation executive committee member Hanan Ashrawi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"By destroying the chances of peace . . . Netanyahu is liable to plunge the whole region into more extremism and violence. Israel, under such a regime, not only continues to be a rogue state, but is also contributing to its own isolation and delegitimisation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Palestinian officials say the PLO is committed to taking its case to the International Criminal Court over Israel's alleged war crimes in last year's Gaza war, in which Israel says it did all it could to avoid civilian casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>More than 2100 Palestinians were killed, with the UN estimating between 65 and 70 per cent were civilians, while 66 Israeli soldiers and seven civilians were killed.</td></tr>
