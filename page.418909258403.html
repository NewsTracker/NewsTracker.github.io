<h3>Yahoo's strange new chat app combines text and silent video</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Yahoo's Livetext app combines traditional text messages with a silent video feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yahoo is quite late to the world of mobile messaging, but you've got to give the company some credit: The new chat service it finally debuted on Wednesday sure is different from the rest of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The app, Livetext, combines traditional text messages with a silent video feed between the two people chatting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>You read that right - video, but no sound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Yahoo says it wants Livetext to be used for quick sessions just like regular texting, but with the emotions conveyed by seeing a person's face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Eliminating audio means you can use it anywhere - in a meeting, on a noisy street, during class, on a train.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's a new way to communicate: casual text on top of video," Arjun Sethi, a senior director of product management at Yahoo and head of the Livetext project, said in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As Facebook, Google, Tencent and WhatsApp introduced mobile chat apps in recent years and gained hundreds of millions of users, Yahoo floundered in its attempts to update its Yahoo Messenger service, a web service designed a generation ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Last year, Yahoo essentially gave up and stopped updating Messenger's mobile apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Livetext is something different, based on technology developed by MessageMe, a start-up co-founded by Sethi that was acquired by Yahoo last fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It combines elements of video chats with the disappearing nature of Snapchat messages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The key thing for us was to make this as simple as possible," said Adam Cahan, Yahoo's senior vice president of video, design and emerging products, in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As Yahoo developed the product, engineers tested it at Ohio State University and the University of California at Santa Barbara, and also offered it to groups of high school students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the last few weeks, the company began offering the app publicly in mobile app stores in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Ireland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The company was impressed with the results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"When somebody first tries it, there is a bit of a moment of 'Aha! I didn't expect that,'" Cahan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Cahan said the choice to exclude sound, as odd as it appears, was deliberate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I can barely ever use a video chat experience," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I feel like I need to make an appointment with someone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Silent video, on the other hand, can be used in almost any situation where text chats are possible, with the added bonus of conveying a person's emotions and a sense of place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Sethi said the company found that video also made chats more memorable by associating them with a person's face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Video isn't saved on the phone or by Yahoo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>And unlike competing products such as Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, the texts disappear once the chat session is ended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The app will be released in iOS and Android app stores on Thursday in the United States, Britain, Canada, Germany and France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Yahoo has not yet detailed plans to bring it to Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Sethi acknowledged that users have many messaging apps to choose from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Is this a new form of communication? Have we hit the opportunity well?" he said.</td></tr>
