<h3>Karl Lagerfeld and Beyonce show off their exclusive custom Apple Watches</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple is continuing its publicity assault for the Apple Watch, which finally hits shelves this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But while various celebrities - including Katy Perry and Pharrel Williams - have already got their hands on the sought-after accessory (and have been duly Instagramming pics of it), a special few, or rather a special two, have bagged themselves a very exclusive version, so exclusive that even the richest non-celeb can't buy it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Both Beyonce and Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld have been given an Apple Watch with an 18-carat gold link bracelet - a design that is not available for us mere mortals to purchase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The closest we can get to the design is a version with a silver stainless steel link bracelet or a black stainless steel link bracelet, which start from 819 and 899 respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Karl Lagerfeld's custom-made Apple Watch with gold strap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"1st apple watch specially made for Karl!! Amazing!!! Thanks #apple!!!!!! [sic]" posted Lagerfeld's bodyguard, Sebastien Jondeau, alongside a photo of the coveted item (above).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Meanwhile Beyonce used her own website to flaunt an image of her wearing the gold timepiece at Coachella this past weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Macrumours.com estimate that the custom gold design is worth around $25,000 (about 17,000).</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That figure takes into account the cost of the Apple Watch Edition, which is available with a just a gold-framed face and clasp from 8,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Beyonce showed off her custom Apple Watch at Coachella.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As to why the singer and designer are the chosen two, Apple won't comment, saying only "all Apple Watches available to our customers are on our website" when approached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But the move is a savvy one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Beyonce is world famous and much-copied when it comes to her fashion, accessory and beauty choices, while Karl Lagerfeld is arguably fashion's biggest influencer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>As well as Chanel, he heads up Fendi and his own eponymous brand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Karl Lagerfeld and Anna Wintour attended the Apple Watch preview, pictured here with Apple's Jony Ive and Marc Newson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The 81 year-old is also a keen Apple fan - he has 20 iPads and 300 iPods at the most recent count.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He's also been key in helping Apple to bring the watch to a fashion audience - he took Anna Wintour along to the watch's preview at Paris concept store Collette during last September's Paris Fashion Week, ensuring it got tons of fashion-led publicity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>So, is Apple succeeding in its attempts to woo the fashion crowd?</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Well, let's just say we've got our eye on the 42mm 18-Carat Yellow Gold Case with Midnight Blue Classic Buckle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Shame about the 12,000 price tag.</td></tr>
