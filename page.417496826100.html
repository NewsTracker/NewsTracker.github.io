<h3>Suspect in Ferguson police shooting pleads not guilty</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CLAYTON, Missouri (AP) " A man accused of shooting two St. Louis-area police officers in March during a protest in Ferguson pleaded not guilty Wednesday to seven charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jeffrey L. Williams, 20, was arraigned on two counts of first-degree assault, three counts of armed criminal action and two weapons charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>No new court date was immediately set during the brief hearing, which Williams attended but did not speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prosecutors say Williams shot and injured a St. Louis County officer and an officer from suburban Webster Groves on March 12 during an early-morning rally after the Ferguson police chief, Tom Jackson, resigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Both officers survived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ferguson has been the site of frequent protests since Aug. 9, when white Ferguson officer Darren Wilson fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The shooting led to a national "Black Lives Matter" movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prosecutors say Williams told investigators he fired a gun but was aiming at someone else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, again asserted Wednesday that his client was not the shooter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I think it's impossible for him to be driving up a hill as alleged, and shooting back at the same time," Christmas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He also noted that Williams is left-handed, and the driver's side window of his car didn't roll down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Beyond that, "He's no marksman or anything," Christmas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Williams was indicted by a grand jury in May and is jailed on $300,000 cash bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Christmas said Williams was kept in solitary confinement " for his own protection, Christmas was told " until a couple of weeks ago, when he was moved into the general population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"He's very depressed and I'm very concerned about him," Christmas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Protests escalated in March after the release of two U.S. Department of Justice reports, one of which cleared Wilson of criminal wrongdoing, echoing a decision in November by a St. Louis County grand jury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The other found significant problems in the Ferguson police department, including racial profiling and a profit-driven municipal court system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Jackson, Ferguson's city manager and the municipal court judge all resigned within days of the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Both officers were monitoring a protest on the verge of breaking up outside the police station when shots rang out suddenly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Webster Groves officer was shot in the face; authorities have said he is expected to make a full recovery, but he has not yet returned to work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The St. Louis County officer was shot in the shoulder and is back on duty, though he isn't expected to resume full duties until August.</td></tr>
