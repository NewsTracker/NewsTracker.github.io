<h3>Observers, new council members optimistic in Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - A surge of voters helped alter the racial makeup of the Ferguson City Council, and observers said Wednesday that the change creates a new energy in a community trying to find its way after months of turmoil following the fatal shooting of Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>More than 29 percent of Ferguson voters - double the percentage from the April 2014 election - went to the polls Tuesday and elected three new City Council members, including two blacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That means half of the six-member council will now be African-American.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The lone black incumbent councilman was not up for re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The mayor is white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The percentage of elected blacks still falls short of the St. Louis suburb's racial makeup - two-thirds of Ferguson's 21,000 residents are black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Still, to residents and observers, it's a new start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I think (voters) understood very clearly that the eyes of the world were watching, and the vote was really the only way to bring substantive change," said community activist John Gaskin, a member of the national NAACP Board of Directors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It was the first municipal election in Ferguson since Brown, an unarmed, black 18-year-old, was killed by a white police officer, Darren Wilson last August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The shooting led to sometimes violent protests and spawned a national "Black Lives Matter" movement calling for changes in how police deal with minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But the Justice Department last month released a scathing report citing racial bias and profiling in the Ferguson Police Department and a profit-driven municipal court system that frequently targets black residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Several city officials resigned following the review, including the city manager, police chief and municipal judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The new City Council will sign off on the replacements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It will work with the Justice Department to ensure that problems are corrected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>New council members say they're up to the task.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Our community - we've been through a lot," said Wesley Bell, a 40-year-old black man elected in the 3rd Ward, which includes the Canfield Green apartment complex, where Brown was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"This community came together in record numbers to make sure our voices were heard. When you have a community engaged, the sky is the limit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Turnout was aided by a strong push from volunteers, both local and national.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Labor unions, activist groups and Working Family Party, a leading voice of the left that helped elect New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio last year, went door to door and worked phone banks urging people to vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"When we talked to voters about the opportunity we have to end a broken and racially biased justice system, people felt like there was really something worth going out to vote for," activist Reginald Rounds said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Saint Louis University political science professor Ken Warren said the turnout was particularly impressive because he had previously sensed a defeatist attitude among many black residents in Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"They thought, 'We can't win. It's a good old boy system, " Warren said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Now, they have organized with the help of outsiders, and they ended up electing two blacks to the City Council."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Warren believes the change could fuel renewed political activism among blacks who live in Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Voters head to the polls in a municipal election Tuesday, April 7, 2015, in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Newly elected 2nd Ward Councilman Brian Fletcher, 55, who is white, agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"The fact that we have a council that has three African-Americans - it's just wonderful, a new beginning for the city," said Fletcher, a former two-term mayor in Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Ella Jones, a 60-year-old black woman, defeated three other candidates - one black and two white - in the 1st Ward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Resident Hudson Ward encouraged the new council to seize its opportunity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"All the protest and all the looting and everything, let that be a wake-up call," Ward said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Change, to me, is giving our kids the opportunity to grow up in a peaceful community where everyone gets along."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Associated Press reporter Alex Sanz contributed to this report from Ferguson.</td></tr>
