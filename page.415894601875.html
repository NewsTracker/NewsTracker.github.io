<h3>Ricciardo aiming for 'at least' one F1 win</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He came into the new Formula One season hoping to better last year's three wins and have a genuine shot at the championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But two races in and Daniel Ricciardo concedes he's had to keep a lid on his expectations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Red Bull Racing, powered by Renault, have struggled to keep up with pacesetters Mercedes and Ferrari, who've shared the spoils in the opening rounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ricciardo finished last month's Australian Grand Prix in sixth, more than a lap behind the winner, and 10th on Sunday in Malaysia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At this point last year, the Australian had a disqualification and retirement next to his name but went on to score five podiums and three victories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I think coming into the season, (I was) obviously hoping to get some more wins and try and fight for a title," he told Laureus.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"After two races, I've got to be a bit more reserved on that now. But ... I think we can still target a victory at least.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's probably not going to come in China, but it is a long season and I feel we can definitely get there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His achievements in 2014 have earned him a Breakthrough of the Year nomination at the Laureus World Sports Awards, to be held in Shanghai after the Chinese Grand Prix on April 15.</td></tr>
