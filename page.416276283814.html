<h3>Rights group: Ukraine's disabled children condemned to life in grim institutions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Disability Rights International said in a report published Thursday that Ukraine is expanding its orphanages and children's homes, going against a global trend toward helping the disabled to integrate into society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The group said it found over the course of a three-year investigation that children in institutions in Ukraine are exposed to physical and sexual violence and live in danger of being trafficked for sex, labor and pornography.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>DRI president Laurie Ahern said children with disabilities are the often the worst-abused and the majority languish in institutions their whole lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Estimates for the number of Ukrainian children in care vary from 82,000 to 200,000.</td></tr>
