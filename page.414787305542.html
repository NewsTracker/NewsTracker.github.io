<h3>More Hep A cases from berry contamination</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Eight people have now contracted the virus after eating frozen mixed berries, including three diagnosed in Victoria, two in NSW, and the three Queensland cases reported on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A ninth person, also from Queensland, has tested positive to the virus but the state's health department says it's unclear if they consumed the suspect berries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries 1kg packs and Patties' 300g and 500g packs of Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries have been recalled nationwide, as a precautionary measure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Senior director of Queensland Health's communicable diseases unit, Dr Sonya Bennett says it's inevitable more cases will emerge given that the product is sold at the major supermarkets across the nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We do expect to see more cases and I think that will happen throughout the country," she said on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Frozen berries grown in Chile, packaged in China, and distributed by Victorian based company Patties Foods have been linked to the infections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Poor hygiene in a Chinese factory is likely the cause of contamination, University of Melbourne's microbiology expert Said Ajlouni says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"If there is a sick employee in the company who went to the toilet, came back without appropriate washing of hands, he could have transferred the virus easily to the produce," Dr Ajlouni told AAP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"One single employee could cause the problem, because these viruses can be spread very easily."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said it was possible, but less likely, that water or soil caused the contamination because viruses lay dormant until they reach a human or animal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Hepatitis A is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus come in contact with hands, water or food and then enter a person's mouth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Farmers are calling for an overhaul of labelling laws to prevent such outbreaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Victorian Farmers Federation president Peter Tuohey said Australian food producers had to meet strict growing, handling and quality assurance standards often not in place in countries behind imported foods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Our view would be to buy Australian grown and you're going to going to eat a safer, better quality product than imported," Mr Tuohey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"But quite often these imported products are packaged in a way that makes them look Australian made."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>People who have eaten the suspect berries are being advised to look out for symptoms such as fever, chills, tiredness, abdominal pain, nausea and jaundice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The virus has an average incubation period of 28 days but can range from 15 to 50 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Most people recover from it, however people with chronic liver issues are at risk of death.</td></tr>

<h3>CIA bought Iraqi chemical weapons say US officials</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The CIA, working with United States troops during the occupation of Iraq, repeatedly purchased nerve-agent rockets from a secretive Iraqi seller, part of a previously undisclosed effort to ensure that old chemical weapons remaining in Iraq did not fall into the hands of terrorists or militant groups, according to current and former US officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The extraordinary arms purchase plan, known as Operation Avarice, began in 2005 and continued into 2006, and the US military deemed it a non-proliferation success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It led the US to acquire and destroy at least 400 Borak rockets, one of the internationally condemned chemical weapons that Saddam Hussein's Baathist government manufactured in the 1980s but that were not accounted for by UN inspections mandated after the 1991 Persian Gulf war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The effort was run out of the CIA station in Baghdad in collaboration with the Army's 203rd Military Intelligence Battalion and teams of chemical-defence and explosive ordnance disposal troops, officials and veterans of the units said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Many rockets were in poor condition and some were empty or held a liquid, the officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But others contained the nerve agent sarin, which analysis showed to be purer than the intelligence community had expected given the age of the stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A New York Times investigation published in October found that the military had recovered thousands of old chemical warheads and shells in Iraq and that Americans and Iraqis had been wounded by them, but the government kept much of this information secret.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>These munitions were remnants of an Iraqi special weapons program that was abandoned long before the 2003 invasion and that turned up sporadically during the US occupation in buried caches, as part of improvised bombs or on black markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The potency of sarin samples from the purchases, as well as tightly held assessments about risks the munitions posed, buttresses veterans' claims that during the war the military did not share important intelligence about battlefield perils with those at risk or maintain an adequate medical system for treating victims of chemical exposure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The purchases were made from a sole Iraqi source, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The amount of money that the US paid for the rockets is not publicly known, and neither are the affiliations of the seller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Most of the officials and veterans who spoke about the program did so anonymously because, they said, the details remain classified.</td></tr>
