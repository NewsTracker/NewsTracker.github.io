<h3>Reluctant Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras fights to pass reforms in Greek parliament</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hard sell ... Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras pauses ahead of a parliamentary meeting of Syriza party MPs in Athens on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Athens: The Greek parliament passed sweeping austerity measures demanded by lenders to open talks on a new multibillion-euro bailout package to keep Greece in the euro, but dozens of hardliners in the ruling Syriza party deserted Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The package was approved with 229 votes in the 300-seat chamber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>There were 64 votes against and six abstentions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But Mr Tsipras required the support of pro-European opposition parties to push the measure through, leaving a question over the future of his government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Tsipras said there was no alternative to the package, which he acknowledged would cause hardship, but he stood by the decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I am the last person to shirk this responsibility," he told parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tough day at the office ... Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece's finance minister, pauses while attending a parliamentary meeting in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis acknowledged the vote laid bare a split in Syriza, but he said the government's priority was to secure the bailout, suggesting that there would be no immediate move towards new elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In exchange for funding worth up to 86billion ($127billion), Greece has accepted reforms including significant pension adjustments, increases to value added taxes, an overhaul of its collective bargaining system, measures to liberalise its economy and tight limits on public spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It has also agreed to sequester 50billion of public assets in a special privatisation fund to act as collateral on the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Anti-Euro protesters march through the streets during an anti-austerity rally in Athens, as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras battled to win lawmakers' approval on Wednesday for a bailout deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The measures were branded "social genocide" by the firebrand speaker of parliament Zoe Constantopoulou.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Among the 38 Syriza rebels was former Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who was sacked by Mr Tsipras last week and who denounced the bailout deal as "a new Versailles Treaty" - the agreement that demanded crippling reparations from Germany after its World War I defeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis and Deputy Labour Minister Dimitris Stratoulis also voted against the package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Amid speculation that both ministers could lose their jobs in a reshuffle, possibly as early as Thursday, Mr Lafazanis said he remained loyal to the government but was ready to offer his resignation, joining Deputy Finance Minister Nadia Valavani, who stepped down earlier on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Members of the Communist-affiliated PAME labor union shout slogans during an anti-austerity rally in Athens, Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We support Syriza in government and we support the Prime Minister. We don't support the bailout," he said after the vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Elected in January on an anti-austerity platform, Mr Tsipras made an about-turn following gruelling all-night negotiations in Brussels on Monday, giving in to lenders' demands for immediate reforms to prevent a chaotic exit from the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Speaking in parliament before the vote, Mr Tsipras made clear he was supporting the package against his will.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Riot police try to avoid petrol bombs during clashes with anti-austerity protesters in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I acknowledge the fiscal measures are harsh, that they won't benefit the Greek economy, but I'm forced to accept them," he said as he made a final appeal for support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>With Greek parliamentary approval secured, the way has been cleared for other national parliaments to approve the start of bailout talks and for the release of funding to allow Greek banks to re-open, more than two weeks after capital controls were imposed to prevent them from collapsing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Eurozone finance ministers are due to hold a conference call on Thursday morning to discuss the vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>French Prime Minister Manuel Valls delivers a speech about the situation in Greece before a non-binding vote at the National Assembly in Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>With Greece facing an urgent deadline on July 20, when a 3.5billion payment to the European Central Bank is due, EU officials raced to agree a bridge financing accord that would prevent Athens defaulting on the loan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Despite strong objections from Britain and the Czech Republic - EU countries that do not use the euro - a 7billion loan is expected to be extended to Greece from the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), an EU-wide fund not intended for eurozone funding needs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Doubts have surfaced about how long the bailout deal could hold together, with one senior EU official saying it had a "20, maybe 30 per cent chance of success".</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Greek economy has lost more than a quarter of its output and more than one in four of its workforce is unemployed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>It is unclear how it can sustain the burden of one of the most far-reaching austerity programs ever imposed on a eurozone country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A study by the International Monetary Fund issued on Tuesday called for much more debt relief than Greece's eurozone creditors, particularly Germany, have been prepared to accept so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But Germany insists on having the IMF in the negotiations to help keep Greece in line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It may countenance extending repayment periods for Greek debt but has said it will not accept a writedown, with the finance ministry insisting it could not accept "a debt haircut via the back door".</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The European Commission published its own assessment of Greece's debt burden on Wednesday that also offered the prospect of debt relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>While ruling out any write-offs, the Commission said debt reprofiling was possible, as long as Greece implemented the reforms to which it has agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Washington has stepped up pressure for a deal between the eurozone and NATO member Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is making a short-notice trip to Frankfurt, Berlin and Paris this week to press for a quick agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>With banks shut and the threat of a calamitous exit from the currency bloc hovering over the country if it cannot conclude a deal, many Greeks see the package as the lesser of two evils.</td></tr>
