<h3>Mary J. Blige shines at unofficial SXSW show</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Blige is no dancer, but the performer moved energetically at the show, even imitating Michael Jackson's dance moves during her funky hit, "Just Fine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She moved like a pro, though there was water dripping from the covered ceiling on the venue's rooftop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She managed to maneuver in heels and an ab-revealing crop top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Go Mary. Go Mary," the crowd, who attended a seated dinner prior to the performance, yelled loudly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Blige's husband, Kendu Isaacs, filmed her performance with his phone while "Orange Is the New Black" actress Danielle Brooks, music manager Kevin Liles and track and field Olympian Sanya Richards-Ross - along with her NFL husband Aaron Ross - sang and danced along.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Where the 'My Life' fans at?" the 44-year-old Blige asked, referring to her classic 1994 sophomore album.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She followed with songs from that album, including "Be Happy" and "You Bring Me Joy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She also performed other hits from the past, including "Real Love" and "You Remind Me" from her debut album, 1992's "What's the 411?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Before singing her latest song, "Doubt," Blige offered her usual words of encouragement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Where are all those amazingly strong, good women that nobody can't keep down out there? ... I mean, make some noise!" she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The voice of doubt is going to be conquered by you all the time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Blige asked the audience to stand up for her rendition of U2's "One," which she covered a decade ago, and they danced happily when she closed with her pop hit, "Family Affair."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>D'Angelo and Nick Jonas are some of the other top acts at events unrelated to the festival.</td></tr>

<h3>Dayton rallies for 56-55 win over Boise State on home court (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kendall Pollard scored 17 points on Wednesday night, and Dayton - cheered on by the deafening home crowd - went on a closing run for a 56-55 win over Boise State in the First Four.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Flyers (26-8) will play sixth-seeded Providence on Friday in Columbus, Ohio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And they recognized that their 80-mile trip to the middle of the state had a lot to do with the place they were leaving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''They were electrifying,'' senior guard Jordan Sibert said of the crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was the first time since 1987 that a school has played an NCAA Tournament game on its home court, an anomaly resulting from Dayton hosting the opening games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Flyers went 16-0 at home during the regular season and have won 22 straight at UD Arena, seventh-longest active streak in Division I.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Flyers trailed by as many as 12 points in the first half and by seven with 3:43 to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Encouraged by the crowd of 12,592 - the largest for a First Four game - Dayton closed with a 10-2 run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''It's a great feeling to be in the tournament still,'' Sibert said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Derrick Marks' leaning 3-pointer at the buzzer was far off the mark, finishing it off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Marks had 23 points on 10-of-21 shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Broncos had already snapped San Diego State's 29-game home-court streak this season, and came up just short of another big road win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Broncos missed seven of their last eight shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''They hit a few shots down the stretch that were back-breakers,'' Boise State coach Leon Rice said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Sibert's two free throws tied it at 53-53 with 1:02 left, and his long 3-pointer gave the Flyers a 56-55 lead with 34 seconds to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>After Montigo Alford missed a driving bank shot, Pollard got the rebound, was fouled and missed both free throws with 14 seconds left, giving the Broncos a final shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Marks leaned into Kyle Davis to draw contact on the final attempt, which missed everything.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''I made a move and I missed the shot,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Marks, the Mountain West Player of the Year, was coming off one of his worst shooting games during a 71-66 overtime loss to Wyoming in the conference tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He kept the Broncos ahead most of the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Marks had a 3-pointer and a pair of driving layups during a 14-0 run that put Boise State ahead 29-17 late in the first half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>With Sibert on the bench with three fouls, the Flyers couldn't generate points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The senior guard returned for the second half, and Dayton made seven of its first eight shots to take the lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Scoochie Smith's back-to-back 3s put the Flyers up 37-34.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Broncos responded with a 13-1 run led by Marks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Also, Sibert picked up his fourth foul during the spurt, allowing Boise State to stay ahead until the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Dayton is 18-17 overall, including 1-1 at UD Arena.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Flyers also lost a tournament game to Villanova at UD Arena in 1985.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Boise State is 0-7 all-time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Broncos also were sent to the First Four in 2013 and lost to La Salle 80-71.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Dayton's Dyshawn Pierre had his red shorts fall down as he grabbed a rebound in the second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Pierre grabbed the ball with one hand and his shorts with the other, quickly pulling them back up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''Crazy play,'' Dayton coach Archie Miller said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Dayton: The Flyers wore something other than their white jerseys at home for the first time since 2010, when they added a black jersey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Technically, they were the visitors on their home court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Boise State: During the season, the Broncos made an average 8.8 3-pointers per game, which ranked 16th in Division I. They went only 6 of 20 against the Flyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Dayton: The Flyers will play sixth-seeded Providence on Friday in Columbus, Ohio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Boise State: The Broncos lose Marks and senior Igor Hadziomerovic.</td></tr>
