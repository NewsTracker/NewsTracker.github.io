<h3>Boston gets more snow, inches closer to record</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Boston is about two inches from setting an all-time season snowfall mark, which current record is 107.6 inches from the Winter of 1995-1996.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Many Bostonians are wishing to break the record, to at least have something to boast about in an otherwise challenging season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Waiter Melvin Angel shovels snow outside the restaurant he works at in the Chinatown neighborhood of Boston, Wednesday, March 4, 2015.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>BOSTON (AP) - Talk about gluttons for punishment: Bostonians buried beneath more than feet of snow suddenly are clamoring for a little more so they can boast of a new record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The city is just a smidgeon over 2 inches away from setting an all-time snowfall mark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>So far this winter, it's gotten 105.5 inches, according to National Weather Service measurements taken at Logan International Airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The record is 107.6 inches recorded during the 1995-96 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Records date to 1872.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Having endured weeks of misery, residents like Erin O'Brien insist they deserve bragging rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Otherwise, some wonder, what was the point of it all?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I want the record. We earned the record," said O'Brien, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>More snow was expected Thursday, but the weather service was predicting accumulation of an inch or less in Boston, making it questionable that a record was within the grasp of Bostonians' mittened hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Elusive is a good word," National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Simpson said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We're no longer in that superactive pattern. We quiet down after (Thursday) so there are no guarantees."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Many took to social media, urging the city to send up snowy vibes and get the record for the entire season, which is measured from July 1 through June 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Have folks already given up? We've got more than a month of snow potential. We'll take the crown. Don't stop believin'," public relations executive Mike Spinney said on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Not everyone, naturally, is on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After digging out repeatedly from back-to-back snowstorms that have crippled public transportation and cost the city millions in cleanup, some don't want to see one more snowflake fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I really don't care if we don't beat the record for snowiest winter," said Amy Ouellette, a marketing associate in Salem, north of Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I just want it over and I want spring and sun to melt it all."</td></tr>
