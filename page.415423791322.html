<h3>Swedish Prosecutors Offer to Question Julian Assange in London</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prosecutors had previously refused to travel to London, where Assange has spent almost three years inside the Ecuadorean embassy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lead prosecutor Marianne Ny explained the change in position by saying some of the crimes the 43-year-old Australian is accused of will reach their statute of limitations in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"My view has always been that to perform an interview with him at the Ecuadorean embassy in London would lower the quality of the interview, and that he would need to be present in Sweden in any case should there be a trial in the future," Ny said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Now that time is of the essence, I have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies in the investigation and likewise take the risk that the interview does not move the case forward," Ny said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She said she had made a request to Assange's legal team on Friday to interview him in London and to have a DNA sample taken with a swab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She said permission was also being sought from Ecuadorean authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said the Swedish decision was "a victory for Julian," but criticized the delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I think it's absolutely outrageous that it took the Swedish prosecutor 4 1/2 years to come to this conclusion after maintaining that she couldn't come to London because it would be illegal to do so," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Obviously that was a bogus argument."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One of Assange's defense lawyers, Per Samuelson, welcomed the move and said Assange would likely accept the offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said he had spoken to Assange early Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This is something we've demanded for over four years," Samuelson told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Julian Assange wants to be interviewed so he can be exonerated."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Friday's move comes after Assange appealed his detention order to Sweden's Supreme Court, which earlier this week asked Sweden's prosecutor-general to issue an opinion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Samuelson said the prosecutor-general had probably ordered Ny to move the case forward by traveling to London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Karin Rosander, spokeswoman for the Swedish Prosecution authority, declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Assange has not been formally indicted, but is wanted for questioning over allegations of sexual misconduct and rape involving two women he met in Sweden in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He denies the allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Assange has been at the Ecuadorean embassy since June 19, 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He has said he has no intention of going to Sweden because he has no guarantees he wouldn't subsequently be sent to the U.S., where an investigation into WikiLeaks' dissemination of hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents remains live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Hrafnsson said the Swedish offer did not mean Assange would be able to walk out of the embassy anytime soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We have to worry about the ongoing criminal investigation in the United States," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Ny has dismissed claims of any U.S. involvement in the Swedish investigation.</td></tr>

<h3>American who contracted Ebola in Africa arrives at hospital in Maryland for treatment</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- An American health care worker who contracted Ebola while volunteering in a Sierra Leone treatment unit is in serious condition after arriving at the National Institutes of Health's hospital near Washington, officials said Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Meanwhile, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was checking on people in Sierra Leone, including other Americans, who had contact with the health care worker and may have been exposed to the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>One of those people was traveling Friday on a chartered airplane to the Atlanta area to be near Emory University Hospital, where several patients have been treated for the disease, according to a CDC statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That person has shown no symptoms, is not diagnosed with Ebola and is expected to "voluntarily self-isolate" for a 21-day incubation period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The NIH patient was flown in isolation from Sierra Leone on a chartered plane and admitted at 4:44 a.m., NIH officials said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The patient's name, age and gender were not released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The person is a clinician working with Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit organization, according to a statement on the group's website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Partners in Health declined to release more information, citing a need for privacy for the patient and his or her relatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The group has been treating patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone since November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The patient is the 11th person with Ebola to be treated in the U.S. and the second admitted to the NIH Clinical Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Like Emory, NIH has one of the few specialized isolation units nationwide set up to treat Ebola patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Previously, an American nurse was treated there after she contracted Ebola while caring for a patient in a Dallas hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The nurse, Nina Pham, survived and is Ebola-free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>None of the volunteers in Sierra Leone who had contact with the NIH patient have tested positive for Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The CDC and the U.S. State Department have developed contingency plans for flying home other Americans in that group, who would also be expected to isolate themselves for 21 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The World Health Organization estimated Thursday that the virus has killed more than 10,000 people, mostly in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The current outbreak is the largest ever for the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>While deaths have slowed dramatically in recent months, the virus appears stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
