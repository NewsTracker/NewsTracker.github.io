<h3>New generation leads revival of shape-note singing tradition</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The crowded room echoes with lilting voices raised in a simple, timeless song.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>There are no instruments, no audience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Just a chorus of four-part harmonies sung from a book that's as thick as a Bible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Each Tuesday, dozens of people - young women with nose rings and neon-colored hair, graying baby boomers, hipsters in beards and plaid shirts - come to this room in the University Baptist Church in Minneapolis to take part in one of the oldest forms of American music, known as shape-note singing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There's something very different about this," said Joel Menk, 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Everybody's just singing for each other and this communal experience of singing together. The focus is about putting your heart into it and singing it loud - really belting it out."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>This a cappella style of singing dates to the country parishes of England early in the 18th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Colonialists brought the tradition with them to the New World, where the music quickly spread from churches and schoolrooms across New England to the rural enclaves of the American South.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the tradition, which had its heyday before the Civil War, declined swiftly as small towns dwindled, church attendance slipped and Americans gravitated toward more modern forms of music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Now a new generation of younger singers is helping to fuel a renaissance of the centuries-old singing style in Minnesota and around the nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"In many ways it feels like the vision I had 10 years ago is finally coming into fruition," said Kim Bahmer, 33, who started the Tuesday night "singings" at the church in Dinkytown when she was a music student at the University of Minnesota.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I noticed there weren't any folks my age singing in the local community, and it was intimidating to sing with people so much older than me," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At first, only a handful of fellow U students showed up to Bahmer's singings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Then, "a few years back, this wave of young folks seemed to be pouring through the doors," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"And it continues."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>All ages of singers now flock to the group, and other groups meet on Sundays at various locations around the Twin Cities area and in Duluth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The music is mostly sacred, but it includes some secular folk hymns, odes and poems - all covering the age-old subjects of sin, doubt, fear, death, judgment and salvation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Melodies sometimes come from traditional ballads and dance tunes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But the raw harmonies and ancient customs have proven to be a powerful draw for Gen Xers and millennials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I walked into a room and my life changed," said Alec Jenkins-White, 28, of St. Paul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I was just transfixed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Growing up, Jenkins-White sang along with Johnny Cash records and took a liking to a scratchy recording of a tune that he found out later was a shape-note song.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Several years ago, he showed up at a national shape-note convention at the Union Depot in St. Paul, and ended up singing until the sun came up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I liked the idea of singing in a community with my friends, but I didn't have a good venue for that," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I wasn't a member of a church where that usually happens. I found shape-note singing, and it was the full package."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>That sense of community hooked 28-year-old J.R. Hardman, as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>She discovered shape-note singing about four years ago, hoping to impress a guy who invited her to a gathering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I just got sucked in," said Hardman, who grew up in Woodbury but now lives in Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"The first time, I was singing all night long. And it was almost all young people. I had no idea what was going on, but it didn't seem that hard because people were so excited to show you what to do."</td></tr>

<h3>Aid workers say 8 people confirmed dead in Vanuatu cyclone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Packing winds of 270 kilometers (168 miles) per hour, Cyclone Pam tore through Vanuatu early Saturday, leaving a trail of destruction and unconfirmed reports of dozens of deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Chloe Morrison, a World Vision emergency communications officer in Port Vila, said officials from Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office confirmed to her agency that at least eight people died in and around the capital, Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Officials have yet to assess the damage in many of the hard-hit outer islands because communications and power remain cut, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Morrison said she had heard reports of entire villages being destroyed in more remote areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"People are really upset and it's really hard, just because for the last couple of years, we haven't received a really big cyclone like this one," said Isso Nihmei, Vanuatu coordinator for the environmental and crisis response group 350.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Most people right now, they are really homeless."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He came upon one of the storm's victims on Saturday, while surveying the damage along the coastline with other relief workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The group spotted a man lying on the ground, not breathing, and rushed him to the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>By the time they arrived, however, he was dead, Nihmei said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Structural damage across Port Vila was extensive, Nihmei said, with the majority of homes severely damaged or destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some residents began cleaning up what was left of their wrecked houses and checking on family members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Relief workers, meanwhile, were trying to get temporary shelters to victims as fast as possible, Nihmei said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We're still not having communications with the other provinces," Nihmei said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We're just running around trying to get information around Port Vila; with the other islands it's really hard to get anything."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A westward change of course put populated areas directly in the path of Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said there were unconfirmed reports of an additional 44 deaths in Vanuatu's northeastern islands after Pam moved off its expected track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Residents awoke to much calmer weather Sunday after many hunkered down in emergency shelters for a second straight night, Morrison said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Many people who have ventured out from 23 emergency shelters around Port Vila have found their homes damaged or blown away altogether.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Teetering trees and downed power lines have made parts of the capital hazardous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Morrison said communications have been so problematic that her aid group hasn't yet been able to account for many of its own 76 staff members on the islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>For anybody who wasn't in a secure shelter during the cyclone "it would have been a very, very tough time for them," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 spread over 65 islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>About 47,000 people live in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>UNICEF estimated that 54,000 children were among those affected by the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the impact and scope of the disaster caused by the cyclone wasn't yet clear, but he feared the damage and destruction could be widespread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"We hope the loss of life will be minimal," Ban said Saturday at the World Conference on Disaster Risk and Reduction in Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The U.N. said it was preparing to deploy emergency rapid response units.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, who was attending the conference, told participants, "I do not really know what impact the cyclone has had on Vanuatu."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"I am speaking to you today with a heart that is so heavy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"I stand to appeal on behalf of the government and the people to give a helping hand in this disaster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Morrison said the first priority was to ensure people had adequate food, drinking water and shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Beyond that, she said, there would need to be a long and concerted rebuilding effort in the months ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>New Zealand pledged 1 million New Zealand dollars ($734,000) to help with relief efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>On Sunday, Australia pledged 5 million Australian dollars ($3.8 million) in aid, and sent in a relief team with supplies including water and temporary shelters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The small island nation, located about a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii, has repeatedly warned it is already suffering devastating effects from climate change with the island's coastal areas being washed away, forcing resettlement to higher ground and smaller yields on traditional crops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Scientists say it's impossible to attribute single weather events like Cyclone Pam to climate change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The cyclone has already caused damage to other Pacific islands, including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Authorities in New Zealand are preparing for Cyclone Pam, which is forecast to pass north of the country on Sunday and Monday.</td></tr>
