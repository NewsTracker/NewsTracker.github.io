<h3>Stocks fall as Greek debt talks remain difficult</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) " A deal giving Greece more time to repay its debts swung the U.S. stock market higher Friday and drove the stock market to a record high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>While expected, the deal between the struggling country and its European creditors left investors relieved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Any failure to reach an accord could have sent tremors through markets at a time when Europe is trying to revive its regional economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's good this didn't go down to the wire to get resolved," said Paul Christopher, head of international strategy at Wells Fargo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Stocks started off the day solidly lower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 107 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But as rumors and news came out that Greece and its creditors were close to a deal, the market climbed ever-so-steadily higher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The euro also gained against the dollar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Dow finished up 154.67 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,140.44.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 12.85 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,110.30 and the Nasdaq composite rose 31.27 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,955.97.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Dow closed at a record high, surpassing its record close on Dec. 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The S&P 500 also closed at record high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Nasdaq, which has yet to reclaim its record high from the dot-com era, in now within 93 points of that March 2000 peak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In Brussels, the deal reached between the European Union and Greece's recently elected government would extend the country's repayment plan by four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That is shorter than the six months originally requested by Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In return, Greece has committed to not pursue any "unilateral" measures that might affect the country's budget targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Greece has committed to provide a list of reforms based on its current bailout program for assessment by Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The deal is a shift from only a day ago, where it seemed like Greece and its creditors were still struggling to reach a basic agreement for the Mediterranean country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Without the agreement, Greece would have only about a week left before it would default on its obligations and cause it to drop the euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Greece's economy is small, but the potential disruption Greece could have to the global financial system potentially could be huge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In a worst-case scenario, Greece abandoning the euro could embolden political parties in other debt-ridden countries to seek to leave the euro as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"A Greek exit is not good for anyone, including the Greeks," said Christopher of Wells Fargo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"If Greece leaves, everyone else could leave and you're left with nothing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In energy markets, the price of oil fell Friday after a closely-watched count of drilling rigs declined less than expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>That could mean crude supplies will remain ample.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Benchmark U.S. crude fell 82 cents to close at $50.34 a barrel in New York on the last day of trading for the March contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, rose one cent to close at $60.22 in London.</td></tr>
