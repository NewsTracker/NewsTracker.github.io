<tr><td>82</td><td>"We are always praying for everyone in Aurora. We wish that July 20, 2012, never happened."</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>Still, while they don't deny James Holmes was behind the carnage, the parents said they didn't think he should have been put on trial, much less be convicted and possibly face the death penalty, given his mental state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>"(James Holmes) is not a monster. He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness," his parents wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>"We believe that the death penalty is morally wrong, especially when the condemned is mentally ill."</td></tr>
