<h3>Russell Brand cancels SXSW appearance at the last minute</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The SXSW Film Festival begins Friday night with the premiere of "BRAND: A Second Coming," a documentary about the actor that details his transformation from a junkie to a worldwide celebrity to an outspoken activist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But Brand, who says he's spent seven years working on this project with just as many directors, decided one day before the premiere that he would not be attending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It is just difficult for Russell because it's a very personal film and he is vulnerable in it," director Ondi Timoner tells the Daily News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Reliving his life on screen is just not a pleasant experience for someone who has lived such a tumultuous life, and is now in a very different place, and so actively engaged in the present tense."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Brand, 39, made the announcement that he would not be attending the premiere on his personal blog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"You'd think a narcissist would like nothing more than talking about themselves and their 'rags to riches,' 'hard luck' story," Brand wrote on his blog Thursday, "but actually, it felt like, to me, my life was hard enough the first time round and going through it again was painful and sad."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the doc's many different developments over the years, Brand had complete creative control and was even the director at one point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But, he explains in his blog, as he became "disillusioned and disconnected from fame," he lost interest in the project, eventually handing the reins over to Timoner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Timoner won the Sundance Grand Jury Prize in 2004 and 2009 for her documentaries "Dig!" and "We Live in Public," respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Brand says that, having seen the final version of "BRAND: A Second Coming," he found it "oddly intrusive and melancholy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This film apparently proved too personal for the British rabblerouser, however Timoner thinks fans will feel differently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The News reached out to Brand for comment, but did not hear back by deadline.</td></tr>
