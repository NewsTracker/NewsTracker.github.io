<h3>Red-tailed hawk gets trapped in SUV grille</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Andy Somerville from Texas was driving home when he saw a flash in front of him and felt a bump on the front of his vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, he assumed he'd hit something and it had bounced off and didn't think anything more of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the next morning on further inspection, he discovered that a red-tailed hawk had got lodged in his bumper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Miraculously, the animal was still alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Somerville immediately called the Wildlife Center of Texas who came out to rescue the animal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Photographs of the trapped hawk show it hanging out of the grill by its wings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Somerville said the bird's body was the engine compartment and he was just 'freaking out' when he found it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said he could imagine anything surviving the collision as he was doing about 70mph at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Just over a week later, vets say the hawk is on the road to recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He didn't sustain any broken bones and has slight bruising from where he was hanging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Red-tailed hawks can live up to 21 years in the wild with a maximum wing span of around 1.4 meters.</td></tr>
