<h3>Rapid-detection Ebola test could be game-changer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A new rapid-detection test that diagnoses Ebola within minutes could improve treatment of the deadly virus and help health care workers contain outbreaks, researchers say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Harvard Medical School researchers found the rapid diagnostic test as sensitive as traditional lab tests that can take days to produce results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The findings suggest this diagnostic tool could be a potential game-changer in the fight against Ebola, the researchers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In the West African countries hardest hit by Ebola -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- more than 11,000 people have died from the virus since late 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Although experts say the worst is over, some new cases continue to surface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In order to contain Ebola, it's critical for doctors to quickly differentiate between patients who are infected with the virus and patients with other illnesses that cause similar symptoms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Conventional lab tests require drawing blood and disposing unsafe needles and syringes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The blood must be transported to a lab, potentially exposing more people to the Ebola virus along the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Results of these tests may not available for several days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While patients await these tests results, they are confined to "holding" areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This means people who don't actually have Ebola may be exposed to it, the researchers pointed out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Simplifying the process and speeding up diagnosis could have a major impact," study senior author Nira Pollock, associate medical director of the Infectious Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory at Boston Children's Hospital, said in a Harvard news release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For the study, she and her colleagues put a promising rapid-detection test developed by Colorado-based Corgenix to use during the outbreak in Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Local health workers were trained to perform the test, known as ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>At two treatment centers in Sierra Leone, 106 people suspected of having Ebola underwent both rapid-detection and conventional testing in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>With the rapid-detection method, a finger-prick blood sample is applied to a treated strip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>If the sample is positive for Ebola, a colored line appears on the strip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The safety lancet has a spring-loaded mechanism that prevents health care workers from accidentally sticking themselves, according to the news release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The rapid-detection test accurately diagnosed all confirmed cases of Ebola, the study published June 25 in The Lancet found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The rapid test also had a specificity of 92 percent, which means it resulted in few false-positive results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Missed cases of Ebola involved patients with very low levels of the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The study authors noted these cases were only detected using an alternative lab test that is not widely available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>They concluded that more research is needed to determine how rapid diagnostic tests would work for patients in the very early stages of the illness.</td></tr>
