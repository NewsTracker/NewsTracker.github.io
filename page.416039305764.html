<h3>Huge, illicit bust of Snowden erected in New York</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK - A group of anonymous artists erected a 4-foot-tall bronze statue of Edward Snowden, the former U.S. spy agency contractor famous for leaking classified information, in a New York City park overnight, officials said on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The large molded bust of Snowden, depicted wearing a collared shirt and his signature glasses, was placed atop a stone pillar that is part of an existing monument at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, photos posted to social media showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The name "Snowden" spelled out in bronze letters appeared to be attached to an adjacent shorter pedestal on top of which sits a bronze bald eagle spreading its wings, a statue that has long made its home in the park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The idea for the statue was conceived by two New York guerilla artists who worked with a West Coast sculptor to create the finished piece, reported Animal New York, a local news and culture blog, which was invited to witness the late-night installation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The artists, whose names were not disclosed, said they sympathized with Snowden, the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor who leaked details of massive U.S. intelligence-gathering programs and remains in hiding in Russia, and intended to pay tribute to him with the installation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Our goal is to bring a renewed vitality to the space and prompt even more visitors to ponder the sacrifices made for their freedoms," they said in a statement published by the blog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>By late afternoon on Monday, park officials removed the illegal statue, which park workers had covered with a blue tarp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Park spokeswoman Maeri Ferguson said park officials were deciding what to do with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ferguson did not say whether park property had been damaged.</td></tr>
