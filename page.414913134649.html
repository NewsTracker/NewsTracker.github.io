<h3>Ukraine fighting rages despite efforts to revive truce</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Artillery was still raining down near Debaltseve, a strategic railway hub, on Thursday, and the Ukrainian military said its troops had come under fire elsewhere from rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Western nations have refused to give up on a peace deal negotiated last week even though rebels disavowed it to seize Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Thousands of besieged Ukrainian troops pulled out of the town on Wednesday in one of the worst defeats for the Kiev government of a 10-month war that has killed more than 5,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Pro-Russian separatists have broken the ceasefire more than 250 times since it went into effect earlier this week, a US official said on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The United States condemns continuing attacks by Russia-backed separatists in and around Debaltseve, Mariupol and other locations in eastern Ukraine which violate the ceasefire and flout the Minsk agreements," Jen Psaki, State Department spokesperson, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Psaki repeated US calls on Russia and the separatists "to stop their attacks immediately, withdraw heavy weapons, halt the flow of fighters and equipment from Russia into Ukraine".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She also urged that OSCE monitors be allowed into the areas under rebel control to verify whether the ceasefire was holding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In Artemivsk, a government-held town north of Debaltseve where Ukrainian troops arrived after evacuating the besieged town, soldiers spoke of their flight under gunfire as they withdrew on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At least 13 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and dozens more went missing in the fighting in Debaltseve since the ceasefire earlier this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Local military officials said rebels had launched mortar attacks on government-held positions further south, near the coastal city of Mariupol, and were building up forces there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Right now there are mortar attacks on Shyrokine," a local military spokesperson said by phone, referring to a village about 30km east of Mariupol, along the coast of the Sea of Azov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There is no attempt to seize our positions up to now. The rebels are bringing up reserves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mariupol, a port of 500,000 people, is the biggest government-held city in the two rebellious provinces, and Kiev's biggest fear is that rebels will try to capture it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Western countries say Russia is behind the rebel advance, having deployed thousands of troops with advanced weaponry into eastern Ukraine to fight on the separatists' behalf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Russia denies it is behind the fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It sponsored a UN Security Council resolution calling for all sides to stop firing but never criticised the rebels for advancing on Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>President Vladimir Putin told Ukraine hours before the town fell that it should allow its troops there to surrender.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The rebels have said Debaltseve is the only place where the ceasefire does not apply, and have suggested they now intend to implement the truce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They have announced that they are pulling back some heavy weapons, which is required under the peace deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The deal was agreed at all night talks last week in the Belarus capital Minsk, with the leaders of France and Germany mediating between Putin and Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The US was not around the negotiating table for the talks with Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine which hammered out the peace deal.</td></tr>

<h3>Man who won heroism medal for thwarting a bank robbery now charged of with holding up a bank himself - and stealing $15,000</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mark Rothwell, a 49-year-old Englishman, is accused of barging into a community bank in Portland, Oregon, with a 9mm handgun drawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Police say he shouted at the tellers to hand over everything they had, then made off in a pickup truck with a bag stuffed with notes totaling $15,703.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Officers tracked down his white Toyota Tacoma and found the cash stashed inside, along with the gun, according to an arrest affidavit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Sniffer dogs then led police Rothwell, who apparently confessed to the robbery on the spot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He reportedly told officers: 'It's me you want... I just robbed the bank'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It is a dramatic reversal for Rothwell, who was awarded a Civilian Medal for Heroism in 2010 for tackling a man to the ground as he tried to rob a Chase Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He knocked a gun - later revealed to be fake - out of the man's hand, then pinned him to the ground while officers arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, Rothwell allegedly surpassed that would-be criminal by taking a real 9mm Baretta firearm into the Albina Community Bank and making off with the cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Police are yet to suggest a motive for Rothwell, who was born in London but moved to the United States more than a decade ago and now runs a home renovation business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>According to The Oregonian, bank employees as well as surveillance footage confirmed that Rothwell was the man involved in the robbery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bank tellers were reportedly able to recognize him because he did not fully cover his face, and had a recognizably European accent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Giving an account of his earlier crime-fighting, in a 2010 interview Rothwell said he sprang into action after hearing the would-be robber threaten the teller, who reminded him of his daughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'It's just one of those things - someone points a gun at a girl just a couple of years older than my own daughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Rothwell, a father of two, told the Oregonian at the time that he had been a policeman himself, and had served in the military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>At the time of the first robbery, he said police at first mistook him for the suspect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On Friday his public defender lawyer, Ruben Iniguez, declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Rothwell is due to be arraigned on March 12.</td></tr>
