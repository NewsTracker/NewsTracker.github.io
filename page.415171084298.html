<h3>Russia bids farewell to slain Putin critic Boris Nemtsov</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Moscow: Russia's beleaguered opposition queued with flowers in the frost to pay their respects to slain liberal politician Boris Nemtsov, many voicing the fear that with him they were burying the last hopes of democracy in their long-suffering country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Behind a police barricade, thousands stood in a line that snaked all the way from Moscow's Kursky railway station to the memorial centre for Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, where Nemtsov's body lay for public viewing in an open coffin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A Russian woman holds orchids at the front of a line for the funeral of Boris Nemtsov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I had to come," said Arina Borodina, who works for Echo of Moscow radio, where Nemtsov gave his last interview hours before being shot dead within view of the Kremlin last Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"For me, his death is first and foremost a matter of personal pain. But it is also the crash of all our hopes. Boris was a man of his word and a broad soul. He was a real Russian, in the true, not the chauvinistic sense."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mikhail Gokhman, a free-thinking journalist who is no longer able to find work in the state-dominated media, had also known Nemtsov personally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Boris was not like other politician," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He would drop everything to engage with and try to convince those who disagreed with him. He worked tirelessly to heal rifts in the opposition. He never lost hope.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"But sadly now in Russia, with every passing day, we have less and less hope. Some 50,000 people came out on Sunday to protest the murder but what is that compared with the reaction to the Charlie Hebdo killings, when all of Paris were on the streets?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Men place candles as they arrive at a farewell ceremony to slain opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in Moscow on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Maria Belova, a psychologist carrying tulips for Nemtsov, put the apparent indifference of the general Russian population down to fear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The NKVD or KGB (Soviet terms for the secret police) have never left us," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"People live like slaves in a feudal society. There's no alternative media; no internet in the provinces. Most people depend on the state for their jobs. Of course they are afraid. Only a few of us are not brainwashed, and our only hope now is world opinion."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Like others in the queue, Ms Belova said she would have voted for Nemtsov had there been free elections, giving the lie to the oft-repeated view that there is simply no alternative to President Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She was young too, giving the lie to the notion that Nemtsov was a "yesterday's man" from the 1990s, whom only the middle-aged remembered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nemtsov was a "golden boy" when the late President Boris Yeltsin promoted him from a regional governorship to the job of deputy prime minister and he was tipped as a possible heir to the sick and ageing Kremlin leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Instead that role went to former KGB agent Vladimir Putin, who set about sidelining and removing all opposition to his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>People line up to pay their last respects at the coffin of Boris Nemtsov inside the Sakharov centre in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But Nemtsov refused to go quietly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Briefly jailed in 2011 for protesting against the second conviction and further imprisonment of oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Nemtsov regularly led rallies in defence of constitutional freedoms and human rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He famously criticised overspending on the 2014 Sochi Olympics, saying that Russia's roads could have been paved with caviar for the $65-billion cost of the Games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It was believed he was preparing to release a report on Russian military involvement in the war in Ukraine, which may have cost him his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In his last interview to Echo of Moscow, he recalled the absurdity of being arrested for carrying a Russian tricolour on national Flag Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>That flag, he said, represented the freedom that Russians had seized for themselves when Boris Yeltsin had jumped on a tank to resist the hardline coup in 1991.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Nemtsov said he never recognised President Putin's reintroduction of the melody of the old Soviet national anthem and all that implied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>People gather to pay their last respects at the coffin of Boris Nemtsov during the farewell ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>While investigators, headed by Alexander Bastrykin, who once made death threats to a journalist, now seek Nemtsov's killers, mourners at the funeral were in no doubt that the professional hit was carried out by the security services or rogue elements emboldened by state propaganda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I never felt safe here," said Vasily Andrushenko, who runs an internet business, "but now another line has been crossed and we see our rulers are ready to go beyond the 'civilised' methods they used with Navalny (Alexei, the opposition blogger currently in jail)."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The death of Nemtsov is the end of hope," said teacher Irina Shebanova. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He was clean and honest, the exact opposite of those in power today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Now all we can do is sit quietly at home, and shut our mouths, and be grateful we are still alive.</td></tr>

<h3>Prince William focuses on football and film on China trip</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The prince planned to spend Wednesday in Xishuangbanna in Yunnan province, a tropical region bordering Myanmar and Laos that has been the focus of government efforts to stop poaching.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was scheduled to travel to a village and hear people describe how they are adapting to living in close proximity to wild elephants, visit a nature reserve and meet injured elephants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>William, who regularly speaks out against wildlife trafficking, was expected to bring up the plight of African elephants, tens of thousands of which have been slaughtered in recent years to meet a surging appetite for ivory in Asia, primarily China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Last week, China banned ivory imports for one year in the hope that would help reduce the demand for African tusks and protect wild elephants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There is still no ban on ivory trade within the country, and conservationists say legal sales provide cover for a thriving black market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>William told President Xi Jinping on Monday that he hopes China can become a world leader in the field of wildlife conservation, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>During their meeting, Xi explained China's policies and work protecting elephants and other wild animals and told the prince that he hopes to strengthen international cooperation in this field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>William arrived in China on Sunday after a four-day trip to Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In Beijing, he met Chinese political leaders as well as young people from disadvantaged backgrounds - another issue close to his heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He crossed over into the business world in Shanghai and met entrepreneurs while launching a festival to promote British creativity and innovation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He also attended the China premiere of British-French film "Paddington."</td></tr>
