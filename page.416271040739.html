<h3>New Mexico governor talks drought with water managers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Martinez spoke to a room full of water managers gathered for a meeting hosted by the New Mexico Rural Water Association.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The association's members have been looking for ways to make the most of the drought-stricken state's limited fresh water supplies while grappling with aging wells and pipelines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>New Mexico has an estimated need of $1 billion when it comes to water infrastructure, according to state officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The water crisis we face is real, and it is serious," Martinez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"And as I've said before, we cannot control the duration or intensity of the drought, but we can control how we respond to it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In 2013, when New Mexico led the nation with the worst and most widespread drought conditions, the state identified nearly 300 drinking-water systems that were considered vulnerable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Many of them depended on a single source of water and had no backup plan if conditions worsened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Lawmakers answered in 2014 with nearly $90 million in state funding for public works projects related to water and wastewater improvements as well as the restoration of watersheds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Martinez said that money has been spent wisely and that she's committed to fighting for more funding for projects that are ready to be constructed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Republican governor acknowledged that new capital outlay funds for water projects failed to pass the Legislature this year because of political gridlock, but other bills were approved to open more avenues for financing water improvements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One measure makes smaller municipal water associations eligible for the first time for loans from the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It also extends the loan-payback period to 30 years so monthly payments will be lower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Another bill frees up $32 million through the New Mexico Finance Authority for flood prevention and watershed restoration work that's approved by the state Water Trust Board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>New Mexico has made progress in helping small utilities, state Environment Secretary Ryan Flynn said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>After getting a snapshot of the needs around the state, he said the agency is working to match funding with ready projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>New Mexico has been through four straight years of severe drought and the last decade has seen more dry years than wet ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>However, the last two monsoon seasons have helped and forecasts call for above-normal chances for precipitation this spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Extreme drought also dropped off New Mexico's map in March - the first time that's happened in four years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But Flynn said water managers can't turn their attention from conservation or innovation because of one or two wet years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Drought is going to be a persistent issue that we need to deal with," he said, mentioning climate change and the fluctuations in snowpack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We're not going to be able to grow as a state if we don't continue to try to innovate and develop new sources of water."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Empty glass pitchers line a table following a drinking water contest hosted by the New Mexico Rural Water Association in Albuquerque N.M., Wednesday, April 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Gov. Susana Martinez told association members during a luncheon Wednesday that more investment in water infrastructure will ensure economic development is possible in New Mexico.</td></tr>
