<h3>CRTC 'wholesale code' change important for smaller cable companies</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Most of the media attention following Thursday's CRTC announcement focused on new "pick-and-pay" channel options and basic packages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, some groups say the little-discussed proposal for a new wholesale code of conduct is key to make sure those changes work by reforming the way smaller cable companies can compete with vertically integrated giants..</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Cable companies generally create their own channels or use the "wholesale" system of paying companies that offer channels a set amount of money per subscriber per month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While the CRTC currently has a guide for wholesale agreements, the system leaves room for potential problems, because so-called vertically integrated companies own the channels and also control how they're distributed, without enough oversight, some say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The changes announced Thursday would give smaller companies more protection by taking away the ability of vertically integrated companies to unreasonably demand minimum levels of viewers or revenue from smaller distributors in order to carry popular channels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That dynamic can affect how channels are packaged and priced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"In our view it's probably the most critical part of the decision," said Chris Edwards, vice-president of corporate and regulatory affairs with the Canadian Cable Systems Alliance, a group representing more than 100 independent cable companies servicing more than 700,000 customers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"These are the very things that potentially stand in the way of the CRTC being able to deliver customers choice and flexibility, as long as those sorts of provisions are allowed to stand," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Public Interest Advocacy Centre, which lobbies for the interests of consumers and which participated in the CRTC's "Let's Talk TV" series of consultations, said Thursday's announcement brings the CRTC's powers from a patchwork set of codes and guidelines to a widespread, mandatory regulation, giving it more power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The centre's legal counsel Alisia Lau said this oversight is key to making sure prices stay fair under the new model.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I think the [CRTC] seems to be more concerned [about] mandating pick-and-pay, but because of what happens at the wholesale negotiation level the individual price for each channel would be so high that it would be impractical for consumers," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"[The changes are] hoping to prevent that unfair, anti-competitive behaviour."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Otherwise, Edwards, said smaller companies could be squeezed out, meaning less choice for consumers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"There is a huge imbalance of power between our members and the people they're buying their product from," he said in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Part of this whole thing, and the commission has made this as a finding of fact, is that vertically integrated companies have both the incentive and the ability to act anti-competitively and essentially to make life difficult for competitors who compete with them, like our members. it's down at the level of the contract where that happens, all the sort of packaging terms and the pricing terms."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Edwards said the CRTC would also have new powers to look at every wholesale agreement reached between companies offering channels and cable companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"That's a very important part of this decision for us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The CRTC is still taking feedback on these proposed regulations until May 4 by an online form, by mail or by fax, with the goal of having them finalized in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>CBC News emailed Rogers, Bell, Corus and Shaw for comment on the proposed wholesale code.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Corus and Rogers did not answer, a spokesperson from Bell refused to comment and a Shaw spokesperson referred back to Thursday's statement from CEO Brad Shaw which said the company supports the CRTC decision, which gives opportunities despite its challenges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Interview: Harold Crooks The price we pay when companies dodge taxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Checkup Panel Prescription drug use in Canada Who Killed Leah Anderson?</td></tr>

<h3>Georgians hit by fallout from trouble in Russia, Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 64-year-old woman spends much of her meager pension of 150 lari ($68) a month on medicine and has long lived off selling cheap jewelry at a flea market to tourists, mainly from Russia and Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Now, the number of visitors is shrinking due to the economic crisis in those countries and people like her in this former Soviet republic are feeling the pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"There were some signs of life in January, when suddenly some tourists from Russia, Ukraine and Poland appeared, but since then it's been a complete catastrophe," said Matiashvili.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some days she makes five lari from tourists, sometimes only one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Georgia, a mountainous nation in the South Caucasus, relies heavily on wine exports and on tourists attracted to the mountains and beaches that for decades made the country a favored holiday destination for the Soviet elites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While tourists might ordinarily be enticed as Georgia's currency sinks, making travel cheaper, many of those who visit Georgia come from countries facing their own economic problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Georgia's currency, the lari, has lost more than 20 percent of its value against the dollar since August - but Ukraine's hryvnia currency has lost about 60 percent against the dollar and the Russian ruble roughly 50 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Due to the economic tensions, tens of thousands took part in an opposition-led protest Saturday in the capital, Tbilisi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The demonstration was peaceful, despite the bitter political divide between the government team formed by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream party and supporters of former President Mikhail Saakashvili, whose party has been in opposition since losing the 2012 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Those at the protest spoke bitterly of their dashed economic hopes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"In the last elections, I voted for Georgian Dream; their promises were very pretty. But now it's become clear that they've fulfilled almost nothing," said demonstrator Tina Khomeriki, a 35-year-old teacher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The government, led by Ivanishvili ally Irakli Garibashvili, insists the crisis has been talked up by political opponents and sensationalist media and is not the result of policy failings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I think that really an artificial hysteria has been created, especially by the media," Prime Minister Garibashvili said last month in a notably pugnacious response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We have to calm, normalize and stabilize the situation. I want to say that we're doing everything to correct the situation as quickly as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>While it has been 24 years since Georgia voted for independence from the Soviet Union, the country retains close business links to Russia and Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As the war in eastern Ukraine, international sanctions against Russia and the sinking price of oil price worldwide have ravaged the economies of those two countries, Georgia has become collateral damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>While the falling lari has made many imports more expensive, it has fallen by less than the Russian ruble over the last year, making exports to that key market more difficult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>One affected industry is Georgian wine, long renowned in neighboring countries, and which has started to attract the attention of European and American connoisseurs in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Despite producers branching out, Russia and Ukraine remain the top two wine export markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In January and February this year, exports to Russia were down 85 percent and those to Ukraine fell by two-thirds.</td></tr>
