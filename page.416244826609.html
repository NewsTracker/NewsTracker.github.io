<h3>Harvey wins in return to Citi Field; Mets beat Phillies 6-5 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Daniel Murphy homered over the right-center fence that was brought in 3 to 11 feet this season at Citi Field, and the Mets beat their NL East rivals for the 19th time in the last 25 meetings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But it wasn't all good news for New York: David Wright and Michael Cuddyer left the game with injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chase Utley homered twice for Philadelphia and hit an RBI single after entering 2 for 22 (.091).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He also was hit in the back by a 95 mph fastball from Harvey with first base open - prompting plate umpire Alfonso Marquez to warn both benches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Harvey (2-0) was no doubt retaliating after Phillies starter David Buchanan (0-2) plunked Wilmer Flores and Cuddyer in the second, both on the left hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Cuddyer, who had an RBI single, exited with a bruise and X-rays were negative, the Mets said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Wright pulled his right hamstring while stealing second in the eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>With the Mets out of position players on the bench, that left backup catcher Anthony Recker playing third base for the first time in his professional career in the ninth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>New York manager Terry Collins was gone by the fifth, ejected by Marquez for arguing a catcher's interference call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Harvey struck out nine in six shutout innings last week at Washington, his first outing since Tommy John surgery in October 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Finally back on the Citi Field mound where he started the All-Star Game that year, the right-hander whiffed eight and walked none in six innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He gave up three runs and five hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Jeurys Familia allowed Jeff Francoeur's solo homer in the ninth before earning his third save.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Travis d'Arnaud had an RBI single for the Mets in the fifth after Duda's second double.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Philadelphia manager Ryne Sandberg lost a replay challenge on the play at the plate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Harvey gave up solo homers to Utley and Cody Asche - and even a leadoff double to Buchanan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That came in the fifth, when Collins was ejected for arguing a catcher's interference call that loaded the bases with two outs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Harvey escaped by retiring Carlos Ruiz on a popup, Philadelphia's latest failure with runners in scoring position this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Phillies entered 8 for 47 (.170) in those situations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Earlier in the inning, Freddy Galvis fouled out on a bunt attempt with a runner at third and one out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Utley had an RBI single in the third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>General manager Sandy Alderson all but acknowledged the Mets avoided throwing Harvey on Monday in the hopes of drawing more fans for their second home date, which often attracts a thin crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Attendance was 39,489, a jump from 29,146 last year for the second home game against Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mets: Right-handed relievers Vic Black (shoulder tendinitis) and Bobby Parnell (elbow surgery) began their rehab assignments with Class A St. Lucie, each throwing one inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>They'll both need to pitch on back-to-back days - maybe twice - before coming off the disabled list, Collins said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>... LHP Jerry Blevins was unavailable out of the bullpen after pitching the previous two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Phillies: RHP Jerome Williams starts the series finale Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Williams allowed one run over six innings Friday in a no-decision against Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He beat the Mets 7-2 at Citi Field last August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Mets: LHP Jonathon Niese is 8-6 with a 3.00 ERA in 19 starts vs. Philadelphia, his most wins against any team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>New York has won his last five starts against the Phillies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Niese went five innings in his first outing of the season at Atlanta, a no-decision.</td></tr>
