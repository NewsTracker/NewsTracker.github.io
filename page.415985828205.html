<h3>Va. woman arrested for 'Facebook thugging' after gun selfie</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kristin Holmes, 26, was arrested for harassment by computer after she got into an online dispute, she told NBC12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Holmes said she posted the picture of her pointing the gun at the camera because someone had mistaken her for another woman and started arguing with her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It wasn't a threat," Holmes, of Chesterfield, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I thought it was a funny picture, and then I realized later it was a little bit intimidating. So I took it down."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Before she did, someone reported the picture to Henrico police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Holmes now faces up to a year in prison and a $2,500 fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Holmes was arrested under a Virginia law, passed in 2000, that criminalizes obscene or threatening language online or in public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kevin Carroll, president of the Virginia Fraternal Order of Police, said he wasn't sure how common similar arrests are but said they usually result from arguments that get too personal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It's not a matter of free speech," he told the Daily News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Free speech doesn't say you have the right to insult somebody else or threaten them in any form."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Facebook thugging" is not a term used by police, Carroll said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The phrase is often used online to describe feuds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It made headlines in 2012 when Towanda Kellam, the Massachusetts mother of a 15-year-old boy who was fatally stabbed by rivals, blamed the death on "Facebook thugging."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Holmes is not the first person to be arrested for holding a gun in a Facebook post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Police around the country have started using similar posts to catch felons who are not allowed to be around firearms, the Associated Press reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They also help police link gang members to crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Even if posts aren't used to nab alleged criminals, they are often used against them at trial, experts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Be careful what you put up on the internet," Holmes warned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Facebook thugging is a crime."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Eric Campbell walked into the manager's office in the visiting clubhouse at Globe Life Park and the Mets manager told him to close the door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A California man killed himself at Universal Studios next to a "Despicable Me" Friday as scared guests watched, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A massive, chair-hurling brawl broke out Friday night at the grand opening of a Fat Tuesday inside the Resorts World Casino in Queens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Former longtime Cuban president Fidel Castro has appeared in public for the first time in more than a year, official media reported.</td></tr>
