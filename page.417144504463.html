<h3>Oldest Known Stone Tools Discovered in Kenya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Researchers who stumbled upon stone tools in Kenya in 2011 revealed in a new paper that they are now considered the oldest ones ever found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The discovery in West Turkana-after researchers apparently took a wrong turn-was chronicled in the journal Nature by co-authors Jason Lewis and Sonia Harmand of Stone Brook University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The paper explains that the tools are about 3.3 million years old, or 700,000 years older than ones that researchers had previously discovered, making them some half-a-million years older before the known emergence of modern humans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It just rewrites the book on a lot of things that we thought were true," Chris Lepre, a geologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and Rutgers University who dated the tools, told the Guardian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Alison Brooks, an anthropology professor at George Washington University who examined some of the tools, told the Associated Press, "It really absolutely moves the beginnings of human technology back into a much more distant past, and a much different kind of ancestor than we've been thinking of."</td></tr>
