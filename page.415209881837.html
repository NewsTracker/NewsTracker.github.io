<h3>Rising Anti-Semitism Challenges Sweden's Proud And Tolerant Self-Image</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>There was no mention of an anti-Semitic motive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Now, the discourse has come full circle, with a full-throttle discussion in media about the magnitude and roots of anti-Semitism in Sweden, which prides itself as a beacon of tolerance and open doors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Sweden has awoken from its fairy tale dream" of being a racism-free society, said Willy Silberstein, president of the Swedish Committee Against Antisemitism, SKMA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Swedes see their country as a refuge from the world's conflicts and oppression; they've accepted large numbers of refugees from Somalia, Iraq and now Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>About 15 percent of the population was born abroad, and in just a few decades the homogeneous land of blondes has turned into a multiculturally vibrant society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the attacks in Paris triggered a debate that flooded op-ed pages with a crash course in the history and origins of anti-Semitism in Europe and the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The defining moment was when a TV reporter, who is not Jewish, put on a yarmulke and a hidden camera and walked around Muslim neighborhoods in Malmo, Sweden's third-largest city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Viewers of the popular show Uppdrag Granskning were shocked to see the reporter being insulted and threatened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It was a wake-up call for many Jews, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I was born in Sweden. But there are places I can't access, wearing my Star of David necklace or a kippah," said Silberstein, whose organization has tried to alert the authorities to anti-Semitism in Malmo for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>According to a 2013 European Union survey, Swedish Jews were already more afraid of wearing Jewish symbols, like a skullcap or Star of David, than Jews in Belgium, Germany, France, Hungary, Italy, Latvia and the United Kingdom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After the TV program, the debate on the editorial pages intensified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The government allocated $25 million to an educational effort against anti-Semitism and racism, and Prime Minister Stefan Lofven spoke at Stockholm's Great Synagogue to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia sat in the front row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Soon after, an attack on a Copenhagen cafe, where a freedom of speech event was being held, and on a nearby synagogue brought the fear even closer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The first target was Lars Vilks, a Swedish artist best known for his provocative depictions of Islam's Prophet Muhammad; a Jewish security guard was killed outside the synagogue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Security outside Jewish institutions and schools in Sweden was ramped up, with police carrying machine guns, scenes that were at odds with Sweden's self-image as a safe and open society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The kids are not allowed to go outside at recess, because of security concerns. The school is like a bunker," said Petra Kahn Nord, whose three kids attend a Jewish day school in Stockholm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Her oldest son's spring break camp was canceled because of security concerns, and now she's mulling a move to the U.S. or Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Parents at the school are looking at the website of the U.S. Embassy and checking out work opportunities in America now. Many don't feel safe in Sweden."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Swedish Security Service estimates that almost 300 Swedish citizens are fighting with the Islamic State group in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Sweden has no legal framework to stop them from leaving and then returning to the country; security officials can only ask the 130 known Swedish fighters to let them know when they are leaving Sweden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>New legislation is expected to regulate such travel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Swedes also are struggling in their approach to immigrants from the Muslim world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Resentment is growing, evidenced by the nationalistic anti-immigration party, the Sweden Democrats, winning 13 percent of the votes in last fall's elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Muslims who are openly hostile to Jews are a minority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But Islamic studies scholar Eli Gondor notes that many immigrants - especially those from the Arab world - experienced decades of anti-Israel propaganda back home, much of it rooted in anti-Semitic notions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"But these are not Swedish values," said Siavosh Derakhti, founder of the group Young Muslims Against Anti-Semitism and Xenophobia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"And if they want to live in Sweden, they have to adapt. They call me a racist for saying this. That's the problem in Sweden. People are afraid to set limits, afraid of being called racists."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Anti-Semitic stereotypes are not limited to immigrants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>When Swedish Public Radio recently interviewed the Israeli ambassador to Sweden, Isaac Bachman, the reporter repeatedly asked him: "Are Jews responsible for the rise in anti-Semitism?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Bachman finally answered that the reporter's question was like blaming a rape victim for being assaulted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"It felt like such a betrayal to ask that question when a Jewish synagogue guard had just been murdered in Copenhagen," said Negar Josephi, a Swedish Public Radio freelance contributor who wrote an op-ed in protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Swedish Public Radio apologized, saying the host was stressed out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Right. As if someone would suddenly say the N-word on air, because they are stressed out," said Josephi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Josephi believes there is a deep lack of knowledge of Jewish history and Middle East geopolitics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"Many Swedes can't tell Jews and Israelis apart," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>After the Copenhagen attacks, a Swedish TV reporter, describing the memorial at the Danish synagogue, saw an Israeli flag and called it "the Jewish flag."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>As the debate takes on political overtones, with some leftists saying the problem is mainly Islamophobia and claiming that the political right only focuses on anti-Semitism, Derakhti, the young Muslim activist fighting against discrimination toward any minorities, said Muslims and Jews need to stick together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"It should not be a competition about which minority is the most discriminated," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"We have to help each other."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Derakhti joined a human "ring of peace" around a Stockholm synagogue, standing hand-in-hand with others in a statement against anti-Semitism, modeled on a similar event in Oslo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Addressing the crowd in the cold winter twilight, Lofven, the prime minister, told the crowd that it's up to Swedes to decide what kind of society they want.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"We cannot allow hate to take hold of society," he said.</td></tr>
