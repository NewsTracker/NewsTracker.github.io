<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Is Louis Tomlinson going to be a dad?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ONE DIRECTION bandmate Louis Tomlinson is reportedly expecting a baby with Briana Jungwirth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The pop singer and the Los Angeles-based stylist, both 23, are said to be expecting a child next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Louis is happy and very excited about becoming a dad and he thinks Briana will be an amazing mother," a mutual friend of the couple told People magazine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It was a surprise at first, but he and Briana are very, very close friends and this has brought them even closer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Louis and Briana care about each other very much and have spent a lot of time together privately over the last few months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They are both really happy and although they aren't in a relationship, their friendship is extremely strong and they are both really excited about the baby. It's early days and Briana and the baby's health are the most important things right now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The inside source added: "Briana is a really lovely girl; she's absolutely not interested in Louis' fame. She's very private and most of the time they spend together is out of the public eye, just hanging out with their friends."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The couple have only been together for a matter of months after Louis split from his long-term girlfriend Eleanor Calder in March earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Express.co.uk has contacted Louis' representatives for comment.</td></tr>
