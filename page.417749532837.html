<h3>Faeroe Islands stun Greece again to claim 2nd qualifying win</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Faeroe Islands claimed a second surprise victory over 2004 European champion Greece in qualifying for the 2016 tournament on Saturday as Group F pacesetters Romania and Northern Ireland drew 0-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece, the world's 25th-best team according to FIFA, remained last in the group after being beaten 2-1 by the 102nd-ranked Faeroe Islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece's soccer slump comes as the country's government comes under intense pressure from creditors amid bankruptcy fears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Faeroes - with a population of around 50,000 compared with Greece's 11 million - have never even qualified for a major tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hallur Hansson and Brandur Olsen, who play for clubs in Denmark, scored for the Faeroes, and Greece's comeback was limited to Sokratis Papastathopoulos' late header.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greece's 1-0 loss at home to the Faeroes in November led to coach Claudio Ranieri being replaced by Sergio Markarian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Faeroes climbed above Finland into fourth place in the six-team group, five points behind Hungary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Zoltan Stieber gave Hungary a 1-0 victory over Finland to close the gap on second-place Northern Ireland to two points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Northern Irish, who have featured at three World Cups, are seeking their first qualification for the Euros and remain a point behind leader Romania.</td></tr>
