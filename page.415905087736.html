<h3>Nemtsov Suspects Tells Court He Was Pressured to Confess</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Five people have been detained in connection with Nemtsov's shooting on Feb. 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Zaur Dadaev was the only one who, according to a judge and investigators, confessed to the killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Russian news agencies on Wednesday quoted Dadaev as telling the court that he had been abducted, beaten and pressured to confess to the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I was kidnapped by unknown men on March 5," he said in comments carried by the Interfax news agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I don't know where I was being kept, but the formal arrest at the Investigative Committee did not happen until March 7."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dadaev said that before he was arrested he was "told what to say and how to say it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At a court hearing in March, Dadaev didn't admit guilt in the courtroom and later retracted his confession given to investigators while a human rights activist who visited Dadaev in jail last month talked about signs of torture on Dadaev's body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dadaev's lawyer, Ivan Gerasimov, said after the hearing that his client didn't even know who Nemtsov was before he was arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>All five suspects are from Chechnya in the North Caucasus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Their origin raises a potentially sensitive issue, given the significant animosity for Caucasus groups among ethnic Russians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dadaev had been an officer in the Chechen police troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nemtsov's killing just outside the Kremlin's walls shocked Russia's already beleaguered opposition supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Many of Nemtsov's allies and colleagues are skeptical about the Chechen theory, arguing that Nemtsov's death in a tightly secured area near the Kremlin wouldn't have been possible without official involvement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Moscow City Court on Wednesday extended the arrest for Dadaev for another month.</td></tr>
