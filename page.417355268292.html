<h3>FIFA President Blatter asks to be re-elected despite crisis</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA President Sepp Blatter speaks at the opening ceremony of the FIFA congress in Zuerich, Switzerland, Thursday, May 28, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The FIFA congress with the president's election is scheduled for Friday, May 29, 2015 in Zurich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sepp Blatter will seek another term as FIFA president later Friday after asking soccer leaders to entrust him with guiding the governing body's recovery from a corruption crisis - again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We have been hit and I personally have been slapped," Blatter said at his 2011 re-election, which was overshadowed by a bribery scandal within FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I don't want that ever again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Four years on, FIFA's reputation has been bruised by the deepest scandal in its 111-year history, and Blatter's leadership is coming under question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The 209 FIFA member nations will decide Friday whether to stick with the 79-year-old Blatter or end his 17-year rule by backing Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The vote comes two days after Swiss police arrested seven soccer officials, including two FIFA vice presidents, as part of corruption investigations in the United States and Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It has been a dramatic build up to the election, which European delegates wanted to delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It is necessary to begin to restore trust in our organization," Blatter told the opening session of the FIFA congress Thursday, a day after the police raids in Zurich dominated headlines around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Let this be the turning point. More needs to be done to make sure everyone in football behaves responsibly and ethically."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>UEFA President Michel Platini believes that requires the departure of Blatter, warning that a boycott of the World Cup by European nations could be considered if there wasn't a change of president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I feel pain in my stomach," Platini said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"As someone who has worked with FIFA for many years, I am absolutely sickened."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Having opted against challenging Blatter himself, Platini is among the leading supporters of Prince Ali and believes at least 45 European votes will go to the Jordanian royal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But a Blatter victory seems more likely - given the broad extent of his power base - barring a fresh development in the twin-pronged investigations by Swiss and American authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A two-thirds majority would be enough to win the secret vote, or a simple majority in a second round of voting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Just forcing the ballot to a second round could represent a victory of sorts for Blatter's critics, denying the incumbent president an emphatic mandate in his next term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But while pressure seems to be mounting on Blatter globally, he has proven to be a survivor of scandals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Blatter's presidency seemed set to end after four years when, in the build-up to the 2002 vote, he was accused of financial mismanagement by members of FIFA's ruling executive committee and a criminal complaint was filed with Swiss prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Blatter still beat Issa Hayatou - now a FIFA vice president - to retain the presidency and the criminal complaint came to nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>FIFA is clearly in the sights of law enforcement agencies again, although Blatter has not been accused of wrongdoing in the criminal investigations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A U.S. Justice Department probe accused 14 international soccer officials or sports marketing executives of bribery, racketeering, fraud and money-laundering over two decades in connection with marketing rights worth hundreds of millions of dollars awarded for tournaments in North and South America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Seven officials - including two FIFA vice presidents and members of the finance committee - remained in custody in Zurich on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In addition, Swiss officials are investigating the FIFA votes that resulted in the World Cup tournaments being awarded to Russia in 2018 and to Qatar in 2022.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Both decisions were overshadowed by allegations of wrongdoing and have cast a constant shadow on Blatter's fourth term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Item 17 on the 19-point FIFA Congress agenda will determine whether Blatter runs FIFA for another four, likely volatile years.</td></tr>
