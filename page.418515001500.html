<h3>Apple Pay launches in the UK</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple Pay, the contactless payment solution built into the electronics giant's iPhone 6, has launched in the UK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The system means iPhone users can "tap-and-pay" with their phone for the first time, and many have been doing so for the first time this morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The launch marks the first time the software will be available outside the US, and will be on offer to anyone with an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It will enable users to tap their phone on contactless payment points to complete transactions - just like a contactless credit card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There were some complaints from users on social media this morning as it emerged that HSBC and first direct were among banks that were not part of the initial roll-out, meaning some consumers cannot yet take advantage of the service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Barclays - despite not featuring as a partner previously - confirmed that both it and Barclaycard would be joining Apple Pay "in the future".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The system will also work with the Apple Watch, and the iPhone 5 or newer model it is paired with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Users of Apple Pay can now hold their phone close to a contactless reader while keeping a finger on the Touch ID fingerprint scanner in order to authorise a payment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Those with the latest iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3 will also be able to use Apple Pay within apps to make purchases online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A host of major UK brands and banks have signed up to support Apple Pay at launch, including Boots, Waitrose and the Post Office, with retailers including Pret a Manger already announcing that the traditional 20 contactless transaction limit will not apply.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While Apple announced a host of partner retailers, anywhere that accepts contactless payment will accept Apple Pay, including the London transport network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple has also said that privacy and security is a key part of Pay, with the iPhone maker explaining that when a credit or debit card is added, the actual card numbers are not stored on the device, or Apple's servers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Instead, each transaction is completed with a "one-time unique, dynamic security code".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Rival Google is set to launch its own mobile payment solution, Android Pay, later this year, while Barclaycard - as well as joining Apple Pay - has already launched the bPay system, where users can choose between either a wristband, key fob or intelligent sticker for their phone that contains contactless technology and can be linked with any bank account and card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Contactless payment continues to grow rapidly in popularity, with more than 2 billion spent via the system in 2014, according to the UK Cards Association.</td></tr>
