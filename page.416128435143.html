<tr><td>5</td><td>SHENZHEN/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Lining the glass display cases of Shenzhen's giant tech malls, knock-off versions of Apple Inc's smartwatch were on sale at many stalls, with some Chinese consumers eager to snap them up for a fraction of the cost of the original.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It came on sale in mid-March and has been constantly out of stock," said one imitation Apple Watch seller who declined to give his name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"On average we sell around 40 a day. Some customers just came and bought five or more at a time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The mimic Watches, built on Google Inc's operating system, don't need a separate smartphone to work, said one merchant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At her store, one was retailing for 360 yuan ($58) - around one eighth of the cost of Apple's cheaper Watch models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Friday, Apple, the world's most valuable technology company, started previewing the Apple Watch, its first new gadget line since former CEO Steve Jobs died in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Customers in China and elsewhere will be able to buy it from April 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In Hong Kong, the official Apple Store preview of the Watch was quiet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>No lines stretched down the street as they normally do for Apple product launches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A handful of people waited at the door, outnumbered by Apple staff whose cheers lasted a handful of seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Most of the shoppers from mainland China, who commonly cross the border to pick up the latest Apple must-have, were there for other gadgets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I'm here to buy an iPad," said a shopper from the southwestern city of Chongqing, who gave her surname as Jian and said she didn't know the previews launched that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I will take a look at the Watch later ... none of my friends have talked about the Watch back home."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But the technology bazaars in the southern Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen were chaotic on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Merchants hawked their goods to Chinese and foreign shoppers, showing off different smartwatches' various colors and models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Some weren't impressed with the imitation Apple Watches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I really want to buy the original one," said Vikram Jan, an Indian businessman from New Delhi shopping in Shenzhen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The fake one is really bad."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Though the knock-offs have their admirers, some merchants are doubtful about the impact on genuine Apple Watch sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"You know some want the real thing and some just want to go for the cheaper option," said the woman selling knock-off watches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"There are all kinds of customers and people who want the cheaper one would still buy our product."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Consumers flock to Apple stores to get the first close-up look at the smartwatch.</td></tr>
