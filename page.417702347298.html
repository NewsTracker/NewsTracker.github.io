<h3>'A Bit Irrational': Holmes' Ex Asked Him to See Therapist</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this image made from a video, Gargi Datta, a former girlfriend of Colorado theater shooter James Holmes, is questioned by District Attorney George Brauchcer, during a trail for Holmes, Wednesday, June 10, 2015, in Centennial, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CENTENNIAL, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>- Months before James Holmes opened fire in a Colorado movie theater, his ex-girlfriend said she urged him talk to his therapist after he mentioned having thoughts about killing people, thoughts that to her "seemed very philosophical" and not a concrete threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gargi Datta also testified Thursday that during their relationship, Holmes showed no interest in guns, including when they visited an outdoor store that sold weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She did not know about his meticulous plans for the July 20, 2012, attack or the arsenal he assembled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Datta and Holmes were graduate students at the University of Colorado when they began dating during their first semester in the fall of 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>By February 2012, she did not want anything more than a casual relationship, and the two remained "friends with benefits" until Holmes told her in early April he could not continue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They stopped talking after that, and Datta no longer saw Holmes and outside the classroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>District Attorney George Brauchler has said Holmes' breakup with Datta was a catalyst to the shooting during a midnight premiere of a Batman movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Datta was Holmes' first romantic relationship, and he had told her he loved her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She told him she cared about him only as a friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in the attack that killed 12 people and injured 70.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Prosecutors contend Holmes was sane, and they are seeking the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In March 2012, Datta said, Holmes sent her an electronic message about wanting to "do evil" and killing people to increase his self-worth, or human capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She was concerned, so she showed a friend, and they both asked him to talk to his therapist about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He assured them that he was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Initially I was just thinking he was messing with me, that he was joking," said Datta, who pressed Holmes further about his philosophy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It didn't make sense to me and it seemed a bit irrational."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In court, Datta never looked directly at Holmes and repeatedly referred to him as "the defendant" rather than his name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Holmes swayed in his chair as she spoke but had no other visible reaction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In contrast, defense attorney Tamara Brady showed a photo of Datta and Holmes, both smiling, on a hike they took together, and pointed out that Holmes had baked chicken and made shrimp for a candlelit Valentine's Day dinner for her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Brady also displayed four side-by-side images of how Holmes looked when he was arrested after the 2012 theater shooting - with wide-eyes and a shock of orange hair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Brady asked if she had ever seen Holmes look like that before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>She said no.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Datta took the stand before a crime scene investigator showed jurors a 45-minute silent video of the inside of the theater, with bodies sprawled throughout aisles and wedged between rows of seats amid pools of blood, spent ammunition and spilled popcorn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Holmes stared ahead and watched, again showing no emotion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Earlier in the day, more victims testified about their experiences in the theater, including Farrah Soudani, who described bullets tearing through her abdomen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>She recalled trying to hold her intestines inside her before paramedics carried her out of the theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Another survivor, Julia Vojtsek, told of wiggling out from underneath her boyfriend's lifeless body after he dove on top of her to protect her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Also Thursday, the judge said he would consider a defense request to dismiss a juror after her brother-in-law was shot three times during an armed robbery Wednesday in Denver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The juror told the judge her brother-in-law is expected to recover and that the incident will not affect her service on the jury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The defense asked that she be removed because other jurors had seen her crying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Earlier this week, three jurors were dismissed amid concerns they had seen news reports about the case.</td></tr>
