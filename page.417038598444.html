<h3>Egypt court bans popular, hard-core 'ultra' soccer fan clubs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - An Egyptian court on Saturday banned the country's hard-core soccer fan clubs, known as "ultras," over terrorism accusations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The ultras took part in protests during and after the 2011 uprising, and frequently clash with police in and around stadiums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The ruling by the Court of Urgent Matters in Cairo appeared to be the latest effort by the judiciary to prevent demonstrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>During the 2011 uprising that forced out President Hosni Mubarak, ultras often provided muscle, directed demonstrators and led chants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They are considered one of the most organized movements in Egypt after the Muslim Brotherhood, which the government outlawed as a terrorist organization following the 2013 military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"They see themselves as a buffer, a channel that offers frustrated, despairing hopeless youth a chance to vent pent-up anger, frustration, and protest peacefully, rather than leaving them with the option of either apathy or violence," said James M. Dorsey, a senior fellow at the S.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rajaratnam School of International Studies who closely follows the ultras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He called the ruling a "dangerous gamble" for the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The case was filed by Mortada Mansour, the head of the Zamalek Football Club, one of Egypt's most popular teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mansour has long been at odds with his team's ultras organization, known as the White Knights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Last month, 11 fans were sentenced to death in a retrial of over 70 defendants accused in a 2012 soccer riot that left 74 people dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>An initial verdict in 2013 set off violent protests by fans in Cairo, who torched a police club and the soccer federation's headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Since the 2012 stadium violence, authorities have sharply limited attendance at matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Egyptian soccer clubs are hurting," Dorsey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They've either not been playing for the last four years, or a good part of the past four years, or they've been doing it in empty stadia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Authorities said at least 19 people were killed in February when police fired tear gas into a crowd of fans waiting in a fenced, narrow corridor trying to enter a match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Many of the dead suffocated or were crushed.</td></tr>
