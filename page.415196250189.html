<h3>Turkish Airlines plane skids off runway in Kathmandu, Nepal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kathmandu: A Turkish Airlines plane carrying 224 passengers had to be evacuated after it missed the runway on landing at Kathmandu airport on Wednesday and skidded onto nearby grassland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Aviation officials said no one on board was injured, although one witness described how terrified passengers leapt from their seats as the cabin filled with smoke after the plane skidded to a halt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Airport spokesman Purna Prasad Chudal said the pilot overshot the runway during an initial attempt to land, before making a second try that sent the plane skidding off the tarmac.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Passengers walk away from a Turkish Airlines plane after it skidded off the runway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"As the plane approached, it somehow missed the runway and ended up in the grassland area," said the airport's general manager Birendra Prasad Shrestha.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"All 224 passengers have been evacuated, no injuries, everyone is safe," Shrestha said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chudal said the runway had been closed for international flights as technicians worked to remove the damaged Airbus A330.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A passenger slides down the escape slide from the Turkish Airlines plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Photographs on social media showed the jet with its nose to the ground, with local newspaper reports saying its landing gear appeared to have collapsed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dikesh Malhotra, who was returning from a business trip, said the impact of the landing caused bags to fall on terrified passengers, who clutched their seats, anxiously waiting for the plane to stop moving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We could feel the tyres skid... I could see an air hostess from my seat, she had tears in her eyes," Malhotra, 28, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>When the plane stopped, smoke filled the cabin, making it difficult to breathe, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Chudal said officials would launch an investigation into the crash and question the pilot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The plane had permission to land and while conditions were foggy earlier, visibility was ok," Chudal said.</td></tr>
