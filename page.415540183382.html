<h3>1 migrant killed, 1 wounded in attack on train in Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - One Honduran youth was shot to death and another migrant was wounded when assailants attacked Central American migrants riding a freight train in the central Mexico state of Puebla.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The shootings in Puebla may indicate gangs are following Central American migrants in their changing routes through Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Migrants had frequently rode trains and been attacked by gangs in the southern and Gulf coast states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Tabasco and Veracruz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But raids by immigration agents on the trains in Chiapas and Oaxaca have led many migrants to catch freight trains farther north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The thieves and extortionists have apparently followed them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Puebla state prosecutor's office said Tuesday the attackers apparently boarded the train around Tierra Blanca, Veracruz, before the line turns inland and heads toward the center of Mexico.</td></tr>
