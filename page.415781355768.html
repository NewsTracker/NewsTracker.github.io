<h3>Greek minister: government ready for 'rupture' in aid talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's government is prepared for a "rupture" with creditors in its bailout talks and is being deliberately vague about its intentions as a negotiating tactic, a cabinet minister said Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Separately, a government official said Greece has made clear during negotiations with the eurozone and International Monetary Fund that the country "will not continue servicing its public debt through its own means, if the creditors don't proceed directly with the disbursement of (bailout) installments delayed since 2014."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The official spoke only on condition of anonymity in line with government rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece has been unable to borrow on international markets since 2010 due to high borrowing rates that reflect a lack of investor confidence in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It has relied since then on funds from a 240 billion euro ($260 billion) bailout from other eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But its creditors are refusing to release the last installment, worth more than 7 billion euros, unless the government produces an acceptable list of reforms aiming to restore the country's tattered economy - by Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And the country faces a credit crunch, with estimates it will run out of cash sometime in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It is hard to know whether the government's claim that it cannot continue servicing its debt without more bailout funds is a threat or just a statement of fact," said Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Either way, the German response will be the same as always: implement reforms and you will get bailout funding, otherwise forget it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>European economic powerhouse Germany is Greece's largest single creditor, and has been the most vocal critic of the southern country's handling of its financial crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>With a severe credit crunch looming, "the only option for Greece to get money relatively quickly is to propose serious reforms on Monday and begin implementing them immediately," said Greene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If negotiations don't go well, however, the government is prepared for a "rupture" with its partners, said Alternate Minister for International Economic Relations Euclid Tsakalotos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Speaking on private Star TV, Tsakalotos said the government would not be negotiating properly if it didn't envisage a rupture, although he would not be drawn on what that might entail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The Greek people have understood that we support the working people, we support the people who lost many things in the previous situation, and that we are ready, if things don't go well, for a rupture," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Without envisaging even the possibility of a clash, he argued, Greece's creditors would just force the country to impose the harsh austerity measures Tsakalotos' radical left government was elected in January to abolish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The minister said the government was intentionally being vague about its intentions with its partners as a negotiating tactic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We create ambiguity with our partners about our intentions, deliberately, because they must know that we are ready for a rupture," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Otherwise you don't negotiate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A government official said the reform list was to be discussed in Brussels by representatives of the creditors, dubbed the "Brussels Group," on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The reforms are expected to generate 3 billion euros in revenue in 2015, the official said, adding that the measures do not include cuts in salaries or pensions, and would not push the economy into recession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>No details on the exact reforms were made public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>People walk past the Bank of Greece headquarters, in central Athens, on Friday, March 27, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Greek bank deposits dropped by more than 7.5 billion euros ($8.2 billion) in February, ramping up pressure on the country's teetering financial system as its government scrambles to reach a deal with creditors within days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A man walks past the Athens Academy with the 19th century statue of the ancient goddess Athena, on Friday, March 27, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A woman smokes as the 19th century statue of the ancient goddess Athena, is reflected on a building, on Friday, March 27, 2015.</td></tr>
