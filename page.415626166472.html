<h3>Vanuatu residents begin to rebuild after Cyclone Pam</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>EFATE -- The roof from what was once the home of principal Melizabeth Uhi and her staff is now folded over branches high in the trees that border her school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She's now living with two other staff members in the only classroom that's still habitable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And she's running low on the rice she had before Cyclone Pam tore through Vanuatu a week ago, upending her life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Uhi is moving forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She's helped organize a community cleanup of the Manua Centre School grounds on the main island of Efate on Monday, and is determined that her 314 students will return to school as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A week after the cyclone tore through the South Pacific archipelago with winds of 270 kilometres per hour, people are focused on the task of rebuilding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The signs of progress are everywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The road that rings the main island is now accessible to all vehicles following temporary repairs to bridges, and the cell network that's vital to keeping people connected is gradually being restored on Efate and some other islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On the sides of roads, crews have been repairing electricity lines and residents cutting tree trunks into fire-sized slices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The task remains enormous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Many of the outlying islands still don't have any way to communicate with the outside world, while tourism, vital to the economy, has taken a huge hit, with many operators fielding call after call to cancel bookings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Throughout Vanuatu, many people remain worried about the most basic necessities: water, shelter and food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Around 65,000 people across Vanuatu are in need of temporary emergency shelter, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which raised the death toll from the cyclone to 16 on Saturday, after confirming three more casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Vanuatu and other small island nations face unique challenges in recovery due to their remote location and scattered populations, said Osnat Lubrani, the United Nations' Humanitarian Coordinator for Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Delivering services even when there isn't a crisis is hard and expensive, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"So certainly in a time of disaster, that makes things very difficult," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"On the positive side, I think people are extremely resilient."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Lubrani said the total price tag for the rebuild is still unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Neighbours New Zealand and Australia quickly committed millions of dollars toward the relief effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>There's also been millions more committed by other countries, including France, the U.S., the United Arab Emirates and South Korea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Relief agencies are also moving enormous resources into the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But for people like Uhi, the school principal, the response can't come quick enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>She's been given some tents by World Vision, but needs much more help, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mothers have been coming by every day to ask when their children can return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"There's a little bit of heartbreak," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I really want the children to be able to go back to school."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The government has cancelled all classes across the nation until March 30, although there's no guarantee the Manua school will be ready to open then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>For many people, small improvements are noticeable each day, whether in their living situation or their health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>At the main hospital in Port Vila, the capital, George Palap has been watching the progress of his 1-year-old nephew, Moses Sam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The family was on Tanna island when the cyclone struck in the early morning of March 14 and tore apart their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>They ran for some nearby caves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Palap's sister Sampat, who was holding her infant, stumbled in the ferocious winds, he said, and the boy's head smacked into the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The family made it to the caves, but Moses's wound was serious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Palap said his head swelled to twice its normal size and became infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The Red Cross arrived by helicopter and took the boy to Tanna's airport, where he was flown to Port Vila, his uncle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The swelling has now gone down and Moses is doing much better, Palap said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>There doesn't appear to be any permanent damage and the family hopes he can leave the hospital next week, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>For others, the cyclone has delivered an opportunity to make changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Lisau Manses was hanging laundry inside her house Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The interior looked relatively normal -- books on the shelves and crockery stacked in a cabinet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Missing entirely, however, was the roof, allowing the sun to shine in and dry her clothes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Manses said she and her husband didn't think they would try to rebuild their coastal home, with its particular exposure to extreme weather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Instead, they are considering building a new home farther inland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Village chief Philip Kasamu poses on a smashed hut destroyed by Cyclone Pam on Tanna Island, Vanuatu on Thursday, March 19, 2015.</td></tr>

<h3>157 Pounds Lost: Erica Drops Half Her Body Weight in a Year</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>After: 165 lbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>What was the turning point that prompted you to lose weight?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>My son, who was around 2 at the time, asked me to play on the floor with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>I was sitting on the couch and the mere thought of getting up, laying down on the floor, and having to pick up the toys was so exhausting that I told him no.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That was terrifying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>I went to weigh myself and saw 322 pounds on the scale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>My heart sank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>When did you start trying to lose weight?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>I have been heavy since middle school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>I had always tried to lose weight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>However, once I got off the scale that day, I felt a switch turn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The next day I was full-blown ready to lose the weight!</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I actually lost my first 122 pounds in the first 13 months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I&#x2019;ve learned to be patient about the rest of the weight loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>I&#x2019;ve toned and built muscle the remainder of my journey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I&#x2019;m still going!</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>How did you get started?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>I just did it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Since I had always been trying to lose weight, I remembered how exhausting and overwhelming it was trying to find the perfect diet plan or weight loss trick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>This time, I stuck with the basics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Less calories in, more calories out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>I downloaded the MyFitnessPal app on my phone and started there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>What was your biggest challenge?</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>I am a binge eater &#x2013; I still am.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>I have moments that are triggers for me; they make me want to eat everything in the kitchen, including the cabinets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>I have eaten a box of pop tarts, cereal, and a whole package of cookies in one binge before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Were there times you wanted to quit or give up?</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>How did you stay motivated?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>I think if you don&#x2019;t have those moments your journey isn&#x2019;t honest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>I have those moments monthly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>I tracked and shared all of my weight loss on Instagram, which helped keep me motivated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But once, I found a website where people talk about famous bloggers &#x2013; the things they said about me and my family, how I talk, and how I dress were so hurtful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>I wanted to stop sharing my story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>I felt like if these people were that hurtful, it wasn&#x2019;t worth it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>But I snapped out of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>If you reached a weight loss plateau, how did you break out of the rut?</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>You always have to switch up your workout routines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>You don&#x2019;t want your body ever getting used to something.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>What&#x2019;s your current exercise routine?</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>I like to make my workouts fun by keeping them simple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>I don&#x2019;t have a routine, and I think that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve been successful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>My workouts can be anything from 15 sets of HIIT to 60 minutes of cardio to 90 minutes of a leg workout and some ab exercises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>I do make sure I sweat and spend at least 60 minutes in the gym.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>I&#x2019;m addicted to sweat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Once I see those driblets rolling, I almost challenge myself to be a pool by the time I&#x2019;m done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>What&#x2019;s your daily diet look like?</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>I am a creature of habit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Breakfast is always five egg whites and a wheat English muffin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Two hours later, it&#x2019;s a non-fat yogurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Lunch is typically 4 ounces of a lean meat, 1/2 cup of a carb, and lots of veggies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>My mid-afternoon snack is a lean meat and some veggies, sugar-free Jello, or 100-calorie popcorn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>I don&#x2019;t deprive myself; I just practice moderation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Dinner is typically the same as lunch, and I have a protein shake after my workouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>How has losing weight changed your life?</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Simple: It&#x2019;s now officially my life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Before, I let the weight define me and my boundaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Now, I don&#x2019;t.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>I make the rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>I&#x2019;ve been lucky enough to be able to help people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Some even say I inspire them, which still blows my mind to this day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>The fact that I can go to sleep happy with who I am and know that someone saw my transformation pictures and was inspired &#x2013; that&#x2019;s enough for me!</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Related: Which Costs More: Gaining Weight or Losing It?</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Do you have any advice for those trying to lose weight?</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Yes!</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Stop making losing weight or being healthy such a chore!</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>We are moms, wives, daughters &#x2013; we have enough chores in these roles.</td></tr>
