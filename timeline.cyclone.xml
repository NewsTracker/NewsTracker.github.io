    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A tropical low over the Solomon Islands may develop into another cyclone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tropical depression over the Solomon Islands is being watched closely by meteorologists and climate experts alike in case the deep low pressure system forms into a second rare early season cyclone for the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jess Carey, a spokesman from the Bureau of Meteorology's Queensland office, said there was only about a one in five chance that the low over the islands would develop into a cyclone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conditions were not yet conducive for the low to form into a cyclone-strength storm but they might be "enhanced" over the weekend or early next week, Mr Carey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should it enter Australia's zone, the storm would be the first clear August cyclone in the satellite era in that region.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
