    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Nott, a professor at James Cook University and expert on cyclone history, said there has "been a lot of discussion over the last five to 10 years" about the need to extend the cyclone severity rating beyond the current maximum of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the New Zealand's MetService, satellites indicate Cyclone Pam reached mean wind speeds of 270 km/h, with gusts even higher as it passed over the Pacific island nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the differences between category-3 and -4 cyclones, a category-6 cyclone would signal mean wind speeds of about 240 km/h or stronger, with a central pressure of less than 915 hPa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Cyclone Pam, Professor Nott said the worst of the storm missed Port Vila, with islands to the south, such as Erromango, likely to have received a direct hit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
