<h3>Another psychiatrist says Holmes sane during theater attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>File - In this April 27, 2015 file photo taken from video, Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes, far left, sits with his defense team during his trial at the Arapahoe County Justice Center, in Centennial, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Homes trial Judge Carlos Samour rejected defense attorneys' second request for a mistrial Wednesday, June 3, 2015, over video shown in court of a psychiatrist's interview with Holmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Another state-appointed psychiatrist testified Monday that Colorado theater shooter James Holmes was mentally ill at the time of the deadly attack but still knew it was wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dr. Jeffrey Metzner, the first psychiatrist to interview Holmes after the shooting, told jurors Holmes was depressed but sane when he opened fire in the theater in 2012, killing 12 people and injuring 70 at the suburban theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and his attorneys say he suffers schizophrenia and couldn't tell right from wrong during the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Someone could have a chronic mental illness and they're not psychotic all the time," Metzner told jurors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"His planning of the shooting was well thought out, and it was thought out in a manner to delay getting caught."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>- Holmes told Metzner he listened to loud, driving music through headphones during the attack so he would not feel any connection to his victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It was his psychological attempt to divorce himself from considering the morality," Metzner explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>- Holmes said he wrote his feelings in a notebook and sent it to a therapist in advance so mental health professionals could understand people like him and keep them from committing similar crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's another important component in my opinion about he had the capacity to tell right from wrong," Metzner testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Metzner said Holmes was psychotic, with symptoms that included his delusion that killing other people would increase his self-worth and help him recover from depression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But people with delusions can still tell right from wrong, the psychiatrist said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After Metzner interviewed Holmes, Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. ordered a second mental evaluation, agreeing with prosecutors that Metzner's examination was incomplete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The other court-appointed psychiatrist, William Reid, testified last week that he, too, found Holmes mentally ill but legally sane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Holmes told Metzner and Reid that he still had homicidal urges more than a year after the shootings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In a hearing outside jurors' presence, Samour agreed with defense attorneys that jurors should not hear about Holmes' "continuing, chronic, homicidal thoughts" because it might improperly influence their judgment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Samour noted, however, that the statements could come up during any sentencing phase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Reid previously testified that Holmes still believes that killing people will increase his self-worth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Defendant James Holmes appears in a video presented to a darkened courtroom in Centennial, Colo., Thursday, June 4, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Holmes, also seated at defense table below screen, spoke in the video to a psychiatrist who evaluated him for the trial on charges that he killed 12 people and wounded 70 others during the midnight premiere of a Batman film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>FILE - In this July 23, 2012, file photo, James Holmes, who is charged with killing 12 moviegoers and wounding 70 more in a shooting spree in a crowded theatre in Aurora, Colo., in July 2012, sits in Arapahoe County District Court in Centennial, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In a videotape played for jurors in Holmes' murder trial Tuesday, June 2, 2015, Holmes said that he might not have carried out the attack if his previous psychiatrist, Dr. Lynne Fenton, hadn't prescribed him a drug that reduced his anxiety and fear, but said he might have done it later in life.</td></tr>
