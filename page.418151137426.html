<h3>Serena Williams' Wimbledon starts slow; Venus wins 6-0, 6-0 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON (AP) -- As has become customary for Serena Williams of late, she got off to a rocky start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In her first-round match at Wimbledon on Monday, Williams dropped three of the first four games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She slipped and nearly did the splits, tumbling to the turf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She was warned for using foul language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And, as has also become customary for Williams, she wound up with a victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>1-seeded Williams extended her pursuit of a fourth consecutive major title and her bid for a calendar-year Grand Slam, too, by taking 11 of the last 13 games to beat 113th-ranked qualifier Margarita Gasparyan 6-4, 6-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Williams has won her past 22 Grand Slam matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''There are a lot of expectations on her shoulders at the moment,'' said Williams' coach, Patrick Mouratoglou.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''It took her maybe six games to get going.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At 3-all, she started to relax and play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gasparyan came in 0-3 in tour-level matches and was making her Wimbledon main-draw debut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''When I (saw) her before match,'' Gasparyan said, ''I thought, 'Oh, my God.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Yet the 20-year-old Russian played unafraid at the outset, and her one-handed backhand withstood Williams' power for about a half-hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Then, Gasparyan explained, Williams began playing ''unbelievable,'' taking five straight games and 22 of 29 points in one stretch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was, otherwise, a mostly routine Day 1 for the biggest names on the schedule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Defending champion Novak Djokovic - and the player he lost to in the French Open final this month, No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>4 Stan Wawrinka - won in straight sets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>So did 2004 Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova and two other major title winners and former No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>1-ranked women, Victoria Azarenka and Ana Ivanovic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Williams improved to 33-1 in 2015, competing for the first time since winning her 20th Grand Slam singles trophy at the French Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>En route to that title, Williams lost the opening set in four matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>There, Mouratoglou said, ''she had to dig deep to find a way to get her real level,'' in part because Williams was dealing with an illness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>On Monday, the cause for the poor beginning was twofold, he said: Williams hadn't played on grass since she was at the All England Club a year ago, and she felt some nerves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''Of course she's nervous, because she cares.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>She wants to do well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>She wants to win, and she wants it really bad,'' Mouratoglou said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>If, a fortnight from now, the 33-year-old Williams were to win Wimbledon for a sixth time, she would be the oldest women's major champion in the Open era of professional tennis, which began in 1968.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>She also would complete a self-styled ''Serena Slam'' of four major titles in a row, something she pulled off in 2002-03.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''It's definitely historic, I guess.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But it's also six matches away,'' Williams said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>And she would head to the U.S. Open with a chance to become the first player since Steffi Graf in 1988 to win all four majors in a single season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''It's a pretty good chance,'' Williams' older sister, Venus, said about the prospect of a true Grand Slam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>''Hasn't been done that often.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>It was the first so-called ''double bagel'' at the All England Club in six years - No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>14 Andrea Petkovic added another later against Shelby Rogers of the U.S. - and first for the elder Williams on a grass court since her first match on the surface, back in 1997.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>''I don't remember that match,'' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>If she and her sister can each win twice more this week, they would face each other Monday in the fourth round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>That would be their first Grand Slam meeting since Serena won the 2009 Wimbledon final, and their earliest matchup at a major in a decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>When Serena was asked about that possibility, she said she didn't know there could be an all-Williams match in the round of 16.</td></tr>
