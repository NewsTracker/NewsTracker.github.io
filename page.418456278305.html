<h3>Hillary Clinton to outline economic policy vision Monday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Since announcing her campaign in April, the former New York senator and U.S. Secretary of State has revealed little about her economic vision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Monday, during a speech at the New School in New York City, Clinton will finally unveil details, the New York Times reported Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Clinton is expected to criticize the stagnation of middle class earnings for 15 years and slam GOP-led "trickle down" policies that she believes have only benefited the wealthy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Times report said campaign aides offered a preview of Clinton's speech, but didn't want to be named because they hadn't been authorized to disclose the information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The measure of our economic success should be how much incomes rise for middle-class households, not an arbitrary growth figure," an aide said in a report by Time magazine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One campaign aide said Clinton believes that closing the income gap is the "defining economic challenge of our time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>According to the aides, Clinton will present a number of proposals -- including paid family medical leave and an increase in the federal minimum wage, which has stood at $7.25 per hour since 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Some analysts believe Clinton will also draw, at least to some degree, from her husband's time in the White House -- during which annual median incomes rose from less than $49,000 in 1993 to $56,000 in 1999, adjusted for inflation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clinton's economic team is comprised of several campaign aides and former White House advisers Gene Sperling and Alan S. Blinder.</td></tr>
