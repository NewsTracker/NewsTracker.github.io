<h3>Greece's Varoufakis courts controversy anew with taping remark</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, May 21 (Reuters) - Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis has raised a fresh furore by telling a newspaper that he taped a confidential meeting of euro zone finance ministers, drawing criticism that he was undermining Greece's efforts to secure aid from lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Since assuming his post in January, the outspoken Varoufakis has often found himself in the midst of controversy over his brash style and sharp-tongued barbs against creditors at a time when Greece needs their help to avert bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He was finally sidelined from sensitive negotiations with EU and IMF lenders after returning last month from a meeting of Eurogroup finance ministers in Riga, where he was rebuked for a lecturing tone and for refusing to show up at a state dinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In an interview with the New York Times magazine, Varoufakis denied his peers lashed out at him or called him names in Riga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The magazine wrote that Varoufakis said he taped the meeting but could not release the tape due to confidentiality rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Eurogroup rules do not explicitly prohibit participants from recording talks as long as the contents are kept confidential, suggesting Varoufakis had not broken any rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the disclosure prompted howls of disbelief from Greek media and the opposition, who accused him of undercutting Greece's efforts to build alliances by recording his peers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Mr Varoufakis has surpassed the limits of political frivolousness and irresponsibility," the centre-left PASOK party said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Centrist To Potami party leader Stavros Theodorakis said: "What Greece has won was through alliances. Greece will not win anything by recording counterparts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Greek newspapers piled on the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An Eleftheros Typos columnist wrote: "We all should care that the country's finance minister at a most crucial moment states without shame that he secretly recorded all dialogues and discussions at the last Eurogroup in Riga, which was his Waterloo."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Asked by a PASOK lawmaker in parliament about the recording, Varoufakis did not deny or confirm he had taped the meeting but said: "My respect for the confidentiality of the talks with my partners, my peers, with the institutions, is exemplary and I believe it has been noted and understood by everyone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Hounded by journalists as he entered the finance ministry, Varoufakis brushed off a question on whether the recording was video or audio with: "Fairy tales, fairy tales, fairy tales!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After adopting a lower profile in the days after the Riga meeting, Varoufakis has recently returned to a familiar routine of frequent appearances in the media and lecture circuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Last week, he raised eyebrows by saying his proposal for a debt swap to smooth Greek debt payments fills European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi's "soul with fear".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A senior Greek ruling party lawmaker said on Wednesday that Athens could not make a payment to the International Monetary Fund due on June 5 unless foreign lenders disbursed more aid, the latest warning from Athens that it is on the verge of default.</td></tr>
