<h3>Hillary Clinton won't take a position on Keystone pipeline</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NASHUA, N.H. (AP) - Hillary Clinton says she will not take a position on the Keystone XL pipeline until she becomes president, citing her work on the issue as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Clinton told voters in New Hampshire on Tuesday that she will not "second-guess" President Barack Obama's pending decision on the pipeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She said that would not be the "right thing to do" because the government's review of the project started during her tenure at the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Environmental organizations have spent years urging regulators to deny approval for the pipeline to ship oil from Canada's tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Responding to a question about whether she would say "yes" or "no" to the pipeline, Clinton said: "If it's undecided when I become president, I will answer your question."</td></tr>
