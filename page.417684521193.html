<h3>European Games organizers insist 2019 viable</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) " Organizers of the European Games insist the 2019 event will go ahead as planned despite the Netherlands pulling out as host nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>European Olympic Committees head Patrick Hickey said it was "purely coincidental" that the Netherlands had withdrawn Wednesday, just two days before the opening of the inaugural European Games in Baku, Azerbaijan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Two of the failed candidates in the original negotiations for the 2019 host have already approached the EOC again, he said, so "we have no worries about not having a candidate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hickey refused to name the two interested cities, saying that negotiations were kept private because "we don't want an elaborate bidding process."</td></tr>
