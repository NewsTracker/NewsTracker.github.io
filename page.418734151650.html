<h3>National Briefing | Midwest: Missouri: Arizona Commander Will Lead Ferguson Police</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Andre Anderson was introduced Wednesday as the new interim police chief in Ferguson, with the job of building trust between residents of the predominantly black St. Louis suburb and its mostly white officers nearly a year after Michael Brown's killing roiled racial tensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Chief Anderson, 50, who is black and has nearly 25 years in law enforcement, starts in Ferguson on Thursday, essentially on six-month loan from the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, Ariz., where he is a police commander.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Known for having a knack for community outreach in policing, Mr. Anderson arrives as Ferguson is still regrouping after a scathing Department of Justice report in March cited racial bias and profiling in policing as well as a profit-driven municipal court system that frequently targeted black residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Thomas Jackson, Ferguson's police chief for five years, resigned days after that report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His top commander, Lt. Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Al Eickhoff, hired by Ferguson days after Mr. Brown, a black teenager, was fatally shot last Aug. 9 by a white officer, was as named his interim replacement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Both Jackson and Eickhoff are white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work," said Chief Anderson, a Philadelphia native, Army veteran and boxer who said that he hoped to be considered for the permanent chief's position.</td></tr>
