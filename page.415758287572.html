<h3>Co-Pilot Was 'Very Happy' With Germanwings Job</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Andreas Lubitz never appeared anything but thrilled to have landed a pilot's job with Germanwings, according to those who helped him learn to fly as a teenager in this town in the forested hills of western Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On Thursday, French prosecutors said Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, "intentionally" crashed the jet into the side of a mountain Tuesday in the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Members of his hometown flight club in Montabaur, where he renewed his glider license last fall, told The Associated Press that the 28-year-old appeared to be happy with the job he had at the airline, a low-cost carrier in the Lufthansa Group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After starting as a co-pilot with Germanwings in September 2013, Lubitz was upbeat when he returned to the LSC Westerwald e.V glider club to update his glider pilots' license with about 20 takeoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He was happy he had the job with Germanwings and he was doing well," said longtime club member Peter Ruecker, who watched Lubitz learn to fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"He was very happy. He gave off a good feeling."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Club chairman Klaus Radke said he rejects the Marseille prosecutors' conclusion that Lubitz deliberately put the Germanwings flight into a descent and dove it straight into the French Alps after the pilot had briefly left the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I don't see how anyone can draw such conclusions before the investigation is completed," he told the AP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At the house of Lubitz's parents, the curtains were drawn and four police cars were parked outside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Police blocked the media from the single-family, two-story home in a prosperous new subdivision on the edge of Montabaur, a town 60 kilometers (nearly 40 miles) northwest of Frankfurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A team of investigators entered the home in the afternoon and were also searching the apartment that Lubitz kept in Duesseldorf in an upscale three-story building in an affluent neighborhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In Montabaur, neighbor Johannes Rossmann said Lubitz appeared to be in good health and was a regular jogger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He described the pilot as calm and low-key.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I do not believe he killed himself and claimed other people's lives," the 22-year-old Rossmann said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I can't believe it until it is 100 percent confirmed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Lubitz learned to fly at the glider club in a sleek white ASK-21 two-seat glider, which sits in a small hangar today on the side of the facility's grass runway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ruecker said he remembers Lubitz as "rather quiet but friendly" when he first showed up at the club as a 14- or 15-year-old saying he wanted to learn to fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Thursday, a large hawk circled lazily over the runway, capturing the same gentle updrafts that glider pilots use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After obtaining his glider pilot's license as a teenager, he was accepted as a Lufthansa trainee after finishing the tough German preparatory school at the town's Mons-Tabor High School.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>According to Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr, Lubitz trained in Bremen, Germany and in Phoenix, Arizona, starting in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said there was a "several-month" gap in his training six years ago but he couldn't say what the reason was for that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>After the break, Lubitz "not only passed all medical tests but also his flight training, all flying tests and checks," Spohr told reporters, saying the co-pilot was "100 percent fit to fly, without any limitations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>After completing his training, Lubitz spent an 11-month waiting period working as a flight attendant before becoming a co-pilot on the Germanwings A320 fleet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Spohr said such a waiting period is not unusual at Lufthansa.</td></tr>
