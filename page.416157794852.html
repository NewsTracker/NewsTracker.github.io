<h3>Judge rules against Mississippi attorney general over Google</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JACKSON, Miss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) - A federal judge has ruled against Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood in his effort to keep Google from getting its hands on correspondence between Hood and lobbyists for the movie industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's the latest defeat for Hood in his effort to investigate the Internet search giant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The same judge wrote a stinging opinion in March suggesting that Hood was acting in bad faith and that he sent a lengthy subpoena to Google as retaliation for the company's refusal to buckle under to Hood's objections about what it posts online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Democratic attorney general, though, may have the chance to launch a counteroffensive next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As president of the National Association of Attorneys General, he's hosting a conference of those officials in Biloxi from Sunday through Tuesday examining online crime issues.</td></tr>
