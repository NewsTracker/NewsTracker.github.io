<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this file photo taken Wednesday, April 8, 2015, Nigerian Soldiers man a check point in Gwoza, Nigeria, a town newly liberated from Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nigeria's military says it is moving 200 girls and 93 women from a northeastern forest where they were rescued from Boko Haram extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (AP) - Scores more women and children have been rescued from Islamic extremists in the remote Sambisa Forest, Nigeria's military said amid reports that some of the women fought their rescuers fiercely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A community leader from the area of northeast Nigeria said Thursday that a senior army officer who was at the scene described the women opening fire on shocked troops in the village of Nbita a week ago, with Boko Haram Islamic insurgents using the women to shield their main fighting force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said he was told that 12 women fighters and seven soldiers died in a fierce firefight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The community leader spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue and personal security risks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some of the women and girls are pregnant, according to Muhammad Gavi, a spokesman for a self-defense group that fights Boko Haram who said some members have seen the females.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Nigerian military first reported rescuing almost 300 women and children in the Sambisa Forest on Tuesday after deploying ground troops into the forest more than a week ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The army spokesman, Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sani Usman, told The Associated Press on Thursday that more than 100 additional girls and over 50 more women have also been rescued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said in a statement that several lives were lost, including that of a soldier and a woman, during shootouts in nine separate extremist camps in the forest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said eight women sustained gunshot wounds and four soldiers were seriously injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It was not clear who shot the women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>All the women and children were being evacuated to a safety zone for further processing, Usman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It remains unclear if some of the women had willingly joined Boko Haram, or are family members of fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Also killed were several Boko Haram field commanders and foot soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Combat tanks and munitions of high caliber used by Boko Haram were also recovered while others were destroyed, the army spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The military was flying in medical and intelligence teams to evaluate the former captives, many of whom were severely traumatized, Usman said earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It is still unclear if any of the schoolgirls kidnapped from the northeastern town of Chibok a year ago were among those rescued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The plight of the schoolgirls, who have become known as "the Chibok girls," aroused international outrage and a campaign for their release under the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Their kidnapping brought Boko Haram, whose nickname means "Western education is forbidden" in the local Hausa language, to the world's attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Of the Chibok girls, 219 remain missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Nigerian military and counter-insurgency spokesmen have said they have information indicating at least some of the Chibok girls still are being held in the Sambisa Forest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Some captives have reportedly become indoctrinated into believing the group's Islamic extremist ideology, while others established strong emotional attachments to militants they had been forced to marry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The failure of Nigeria's government and military to quickly rescue the Chibok girls brought international condemnation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The military initially appeared incapable of curbing Boko Haram as the insurgents took control of a large swath of northeast Nigeria last year and declared it an Islamic caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That changed when the military received much-needed helicopter gunships and heavy arms and a multinational force launched an offensive at the end of January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said Thursday only the Sambisa Forest remains a refuge for the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Jonathan pledged to "hand over a Nigeria completely free of terrorist strongholds," at a regional meeting of customs officials Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He lost March 28 elections, in part because of the military failures and a perceived uncaring attitude to the plight of victims of Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari becomes president on May 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Faul reported from Abuja, Nigeria.</td></tr>
