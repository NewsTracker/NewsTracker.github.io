<h3>Cockpit voice recorder hoped to unravel &#039;inexplicable&#039; Germanwings crash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A young German co-pilot locked himself alone in the cockpit of Germanwings flight 9525 and set it on course to crash into an Alpine mountain, killing all 150 people on board including himself, prosecutors said on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>French prosecutors offered no motive for why 28-year-old Andreas Lubitz apparently took the controls of the Airbus A320, locked the captain out of the cockpit and deliberately set it veering down from cruising altitude at 3,000 feet per minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>German police were searching his home for evidence that might offer some explanation for what was behind Tuesday's crash in the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>French and German officials said there was no indication he was a terrorist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Acquaintances described Lubitz as an affable young man who had given no sign of harboring harmful intent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin, Lubitz acted "for a reason we cannot fathom right now but which looks like intent to destroy this aircraft".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Setting the plane's controls for rapid descent was an act that "could only have been voluntary", Robin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He had... no reason to stop the pilot-in-command from coming back into the cockpit. He had no reason to refuse to answer to the air controller who was alerting him on the loss of altitude."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The captain, who had stepped out of the cockpit, probably to use the toilet, tried to force his way back in: "You can hear banging to try to smash the door down," Robin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Describing sound recordings from one of the plane's black boxes, Robin said most of the passengers would not have been aware of their fate until the very end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Only toward the end do you hear screams," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"And bear in mind that death would have been instantaneous...the aircraft was literally smashed to bits."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>FlightRadar24, an online air tracking service that uses satellite data, said it had found evidence the autopilot was abruptly switched from cruising height to maintain an altitude of just 100 feet, the lowest possible setting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The plane crashed at about 6,000 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Between 09:30:52 and 09:30:55 you can see that the autopilot was manually changed from 38,000 feet to 100 feet and 9 seconds later the aircraft started to descend, probably with the 'open descent' autopilot setting," Fredrik Lindahl, chief executive of the Swedish tracking service, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The CEO of Lufthansa, parent company of Germanwings, said its air crew were picked carefully and subjected to psychological vetting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"No matter your safety regulations, no matter how high you set the bar, and we have incredibly high standards, there is no way to rule out such an event," CEO Carsten Spohr said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Attention will now focus on the motivations of Lubitz, a German national who joined the budget carrier in September 2013 and had just 630 hours of flying time - compared with the 6,000 hours of the flight captain, named in German media only as "Patrick S." in accordance with usual practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Robin said there were no grounds to suspect that Lubitz was carrying out a terrorist attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Suicide" was also the wrong word to describe actions which killed so many other people, the prosecutor added: "I don't necessarily call it suicide when you have responsibility for 100 or so lives."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The family of the co-pilot arrived in France for a tribute alongside other victims but was being kept apart from the others, Robin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Police set up guard outside Lubitz's house in Montabaur, Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Acquaintances in the town said they were stunned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I'm just speechless. I don't have any explanation for this. Knowing Andreas, this is just inconceivable for me," said Peter Ruecker, a long-time member of the local flight club where Lubitz received his flying license years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A photo on Lubitz's Facebook page, which was later taken down, shows a smiling young man posing in front of San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Robin said the conversation between the two pilots before the captain left the cockpit started normally but that Lubitz's replies became "laconic" as they started readying what would have been the normal descent to the airport of Duesseldorf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Investigators were still searching for the second of the two black boxes on Thursday in the ravine where the plane crashed, 100 km (65 miles) from Nice, which would contain data from the plane's instruments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Pilots may temporarily leave the cockpit at certain times and in certain circumstances, such as while the aircraft is cruising, according to German aviation law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Cockpit doors can be opened from the outside with a code, in line with regulations introduced after the Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>11, 2001 attacks in the United States, but the code can be overridden from inside the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Lufthansa's CEO said that either the pilot had entered the code incorrectly, or the co-pilot inside had overridden it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Germanwings said 72 Germans were killed in the first major air passenger disaster on French soil since the 2000 Concorde accident just outside Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Madrid revised down on Thursday the number of Spanish victims to 50 from 51 previously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>As well as Germans and Spaniards, victims included three Americans, a Moroccan and citizens of Britain, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Iran and the Netherlands, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>However, DNA checks to identify them could take weeks, the French government said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The families of victims were being flown to Marseille on Thursday before being taken up to the zone close to the crash site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Chapels had been prepared for them with a view of the mountain where their relatives died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Relatives and friends of the 150 passengers and crew who died in the Germanwings aircrash are expected to begin arriving tonight in the alpine town of Seyne Les Alpes in south east France as more information about the tragedy begins to emerge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Crash investigators say useable data has been retrieved from the cockpit voice recorder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Investigators say the plane's last communication with air traffic control was routine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>But according to the New York Times, quoting an unamed investigator, the recording indicates one of the two pilots was locked out of the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Investigators have retrieved cockpit voice recordings from one of the 'black boxes' of the German jet that crashed in the Alps, killing everyone onboard, and the New York Times said the audio showed one of the pilots left the cockpit and could not get back in before the plane went down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"The guy outside is knocking lightly on the door and there is no answer," an unnamed investigator told the Times, citing the recordings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"And then he hits the door stronger and no answer. There is never an answer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"You can hear he is trying to smash the door down," the investigator added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The retrieval of the recordings came as French President Francois Hollande, Germany's Angela Merkel and Spain's Mariano Rajoy traveled to the crash site in a remote French Alpine region to pay tribute to the 150 victims, mostly Germany and Spanish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>However, while Hollande promised that authorities would not rest until the causes of the crash were known, France's BEA air incident investigation bureau said it was still far too early to draw meaningful conclusions on why the plane, operated by the Germanwings budget arm of Lufthansa (LHAG.DE), went down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"We have just been able to extract a useable audio data file," BEA director Remi Jouty told a news conference at the agency's headquarters outside Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"We have not yet been able to study and to establish an exact timing for all the sounds and words heard on this file."</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Jouty expected the first basic analysis in "a matter of days" but warned this read-out could be subject to errors and that more work would be needed for a full interpretation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Although he said "words" had been heard on the tape, Jouty would not confirm whether that meant the Airbus A320's pilots were conscious and he gave no details of the recordings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The New York Times quoted a senior military official involved in the investigation as saying the cockpit audio showed "very smooth, very cool" conversation between the pilots in the early part of the flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>The audio then indicated one of the pilots left the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>"We don't know yet the reason why one of the guys went out," the official added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>"But what is sure is that at the very end of the flight, the other pilot is alone and does not open the door."</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>A Lufthansa spokesman said the carrier was aware of the Times story, adding: "We have no information from the authorities that confirms this report and we are seeking more information. We will not take part in speculation on the causes of the crash. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>He said that since the Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>11, 2001, hijacked plane attacks on the United States, cockpit doors cannot be opened from the outside, in line with regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve earlier said a terror attack was not the main hypothesis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Jouty said, however, that no theory could be excluded yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>While stressing it was too early to form a clear picture, he ruled out a mid-air explosion and said the crash scenario did not appear to be linked to depressurization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>In what seemed an accelerated push to extract as much early information as possible from the cockpit tapes, BEA officials worked late into the evening at their offices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Officials did not rule out calling a new news conference quickly if there are concrete developments to report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Jouty said the second, data black box had not been found and said he could not confirm Hollande's remark that its casing had been discovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Among the new details, he said the airliner had flown in a straight line directly into the mountain, but would not say whether that seemed to be at the hand of a pilot or auto-pilot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Germanwings said 72 Germans were killed in Tuesday's crash, the first major air passenger disaster on French soil since the 2000 Concorde accident just outside Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>Spanish officials said 51 Spaniards were among the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>However DNA checks to identify them could take weeks, the French government said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Lufthansa Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr said the airline had never lost a plane during the cruise stage of flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>"It is inexplicable this could happen to a plane free of technical problems and with an experienced, Lufthansa-trained pilot," Spohr told reporters in Frankfurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Hollande, Merkel and Rajoy thanked search teams and met residents in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes, where the salvaging operation has been set up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>"Dear Angela, dear Mariano, rest assured ... we will find out everything," Hollande told Merkel and Rajoy, pledging to get to the bottom of what caused the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>"France stands by you."</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Merkel replied: "It feels good that in a difficult hour like this that we're standing so closely together in friendship."</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>A tribute ceremony took place on a site with a view in the distance of the mountain against which the Airbus crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Lufthansa said the 24-year-old plane had just on Monday had repairs to the hatch through which the nose wheel descends for landing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>A spokeswoman said that was not a safety issue but that repairs had been made to reduce noise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Police and forensic teams on foot and in helicopters investigated the site about 100 km (65 miles) north of Nice where the airliner slammed into mountains after what aviation officials called a sharp descent but not freefall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>"When we go to a crash site we expect to find part of the fuselage. But here we see nothing at all," pilot Xavier Roy, coordinating air operations, said of the confetti of debris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>Roy said teams of investigators had been dropped by helicopter onto the site and were working roped together at altitudes of around 2,000 meters (6,000 feet).</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Germanwings said it had canceled one flight on Wednesday and was using 11 planes from other carriers for about 40 flights after some of its crew members had refused to fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>Employees laid candles and flowers by Germanwings headquarters at Cologne/Bonn airport, while Lufthansa and Germanwings staff worldwide held a moment of silence at 10:53 a.m. local time (0953 GMT) - the moment the plane went missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>Among the victims were 16 teenagers and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>They were on their way home after a Spanish exchange visit near Barcelona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>"On Tuesday last week we sent off 16 happy young people, with two happy young colleagues, on a journey and what was meant to be a happy trip ... has ended in tragedy," headmaster Ulrich Wessel told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Barcelona's Liceu opera house said two singers, Kazakhstan-born Oleg Bryjak and German Maria Radner, died while returning to Duesseldorf after performing in Wagner's "Siegfried".</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>The BEA said the plane started descending a minute after reaching cruising height and lost altitude for over nine minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>The last words of the pilot to the ground confirmed the next navigational waypoint, ending with a call-sign and "thank you".</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>The A320 is one of the world's most used passenger jets and industry statistics suggest it has a good safety record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>In December, however, regulators ordered a change in procedure after computers on a similar jet - also operated by Lufthansa between Spain and Germany - pushed it downwards as it tried to level off, forcing pilots to intervene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>Investigators have retrieved cockpit voice recordings from one of the black boxes of the German Airbus plane that smashed into the Alps, killing everyone onboard, and they expect a preliminary read-out of their content in days, an official said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
