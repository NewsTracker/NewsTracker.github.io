<h3>Apple Granted New Trial Over Damages in iTunes Patent Case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple pointed to this case as an example of why patent reform is needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A federal judge threw out a $532.9 million jury award against Apple for infringing on three patents of a closely held Texas software company with its iTunes service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap on Tuesday ordered a retrial on the damage award after Apple argued the jurors miscalculated the royalties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The ruling nullified a Feb. 24 award to Smartflash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Smartflash, which makes no products, claimed Apple violated its patents connected to storing data and managing payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Tyler, Texas, company said Smartflash founder Patrick Racz had shared his plans with Augustin Farrugia, who later became an Apple senior director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Smartflash said Apple used its technology to manage payments for apps in its iTunes store, specifically "Coin Dozer Pro" and "Grub Guardian."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Initially Smartflash also sued the manufacturers of those games, but they were dismissed from the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In its appeal, Apple said jurors inflated the royalties the company owed because they failed to differentiate between patented and unpatented features.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Apple shares were down 1.65% to $123.66 a share in afternoon trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Rachel Wolf, a spokeswoman for Apple, declined to comment on the news of the retrial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She reiterated a statement from February which accused Smartflash of exploiting the patent system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Apple has said the case highlights the need for patent reform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Both the House and Senate are considering legislation that would limit so-called patent trolls, which exploit broad patents to collect royalties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Smartflash and Bradley Caldwell, a Dallas-based trial lawyer representing the company, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Earlier this year, Racz wrote a column in The Huffington Post saying he is an inventor, not a troll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Smartflash originally sought damages of $852 million in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, a popular location for patent cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The new trial on damages will begin September 14.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Smartflash also has filed suits over the same technology against Amazon, Google and Samsung Electronics.</td></tr>
