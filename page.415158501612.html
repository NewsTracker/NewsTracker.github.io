<h3>'That's my son!': Jihadi John's mother screams watching Islamic State video</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The mother of Mohammed Emwazi knew he was Jihadi John and screamed "that's my son" when he first appeared in an Islamic State video - but it is believed she failed to tip off the authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ghania Emwazi recognised her son's voice as the masked, knife-wielding killer in the video showing the beheading of American James Foley last August - the first Western hostage to be murdered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>American journalist James Foley was beheaded by Islamic State militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mrs Emwazi screamed at the television when she saw the hooded figure ranting before appearing to murder Mr Foley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After watching the video a second time, Emwazi's father Jassem was also sure it was his son, Kuwaiti investigators disclosed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There is no evidence the parents went to the police or security services to alert them and it was not until September that officials began to suspect he was the world's most wanted man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Police officers near the home of Islamic State militant Mohammed Emwazi, popularly known as Jihadi John.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His identity was made public last week although he has still not been officially confirmed as the man responsible for the murder of at least five Western hostages, including Britons Alan Henning and David Haines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Emwazi family are in hiding in Kuwait, after returning there from the UK, and have been questioned by the security services there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It is believed the parents came to the UK in the 90s as asylum seekers because they were accused of being supporters of Saddam Hussein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Emwazi was questioned along with one of his sons for most of the day on Sunday after being summoned by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Unmasked: Jihadi John has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The mother recognised the voice and she screamed 'that is my son' while he was talking before beheading the first American hostage," a source familiar with the Kuwaiti investigation said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"When they played the video again, the father was sure it was his son."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Insiders described Mr Emwazi as "emotional and upset at what had happened to his son" while talking to investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I am waiting day-by-day to hear about his death," he is said to have told his interrogators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Emwazi - who now lives in al-Oyoun, a neighbourhood near Taima, about 20 miles outside Kuwait City - said he last had contact with his son in 2013, shortly before he travelled to Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The murderer is said to have told his parents that he planned to move to Syria to "deliver aid".</td></tr>

<h3>Give shoplifters softer sentences if they steal from top stores - Labour MP: David Lammy says luxury shops such as Fortnam and Mason can absorb losses</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>David Lammy, an ex-Government minister and barrister, said the likes of luxury goods shop Fortnum and Mason could more easily absorb the loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The London mayoral candidate wants the law to be changed so the seriousness of shoplifting is decided by the impact on the victim - rather than the monetary value of the item stolen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson today condemned the 'absurd' idea, insisting it was wrong to 'minimise shoplifting from swish, posh shops'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Experts also warned it would make shoplifters more likely to target supermarkets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'Labour's justice policies are pretty thin on the ground at the best of times, but this latest contribution hardly seems a sensible one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Johnson branded Mr Lammy's comments 'absurd'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He told LBC radio: 'If he is seriously saying that we should discount or minimise shoplifting from swish, posh shops then I think he is totally wrong because it is a crime wherever it is committed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Currently, the law decides what constitutes a 'serious' shoplifting offence on the basis of an item's value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In a pamphlet for the Policy Exchange think-tank, Tottenham MP Mr Lammy says: 'The impact of a 150 theft, for example, would be far greater on an independent corner shop than on Fortnum & Mason, yet this is not reflected under the current Act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'It is self-evident that the impact of a 200 theft to a large retailer is much smaller that it would be to a small, independent retailer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The idea will prove hugely controversial as, for the first time, it would make the wealth of the victim a factor in deciding sentencing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Critics warn it is a slippery slope which might lead to other crimes - such as burglary - being added to the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Mr Lammy, whose constituency was hit by rioting in 2011, insists: 'As with most types of property crime, the social costs of shoplifting are regressive - they hit poorest communities hardest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>David Green, a criminologist and director of the Civitas think-tank, said: 'What any sensible legal system is doing is weighing up the degree of moral responsibility of the person who perpetrated the act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'It is completely wrong to punish someone more severely because they stole from a poor person than if they stole from a supermarket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Lammy's Policy Exchange report, which will be launched at a speech in London today, warns the police and the courts are turning a blind eye to property crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some one in three burglaries and nine in ten shoplifting incidents are not reported to the police because the victims have no faith the case will be properly dealt with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>John Munroe, of the British Retail Consortium, said: 'Any suggestion a crime against a retailer or staff should be treated any differently because of the type of store, or the place it's in, is absolutely nonsensical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>'Retailers are at the heart of every community, whether that's a high-end shop in Knightsbridge or one in David Lammy's constituency of Tottenham.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'Crimes against them are not victimless, they have a direct impact on the local community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Shoplifting has been repeatedly downgraded in seriousness by the authorities over the past decade.</td></tr>
