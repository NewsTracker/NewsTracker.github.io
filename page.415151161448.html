<h3>Video reports conflict in probe of Putin critic's slaying</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>No suspects have been arrested since Nemtsov was shot dead Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>According to Russian investigators, he was walking home on a Moscow bridge near the Kremlin with a woman when he was shot four times by an assailant, who then escaped in a light-colored car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The area is one of the most secure, heavily photographed parts of the Russian capital but it was not clear what CCTV footage may have captured his slaying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The attack came just hours after a radio interview in which Nemtsov denounced Russian President Vladimir Putin's "mad, aggressive policy" in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The business newspaper Kommersant on Monday quoted anonymous sources in the Interior Ministry as saying there was no CCTV footage of the killing because the cameras in question were not working at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However, Yelena Novikova, a spokeswoman for Moscow's information technology department, which oversees the city's surveillance cameras, said Monday that all cameras "belonging to the city" were operating correctly on the night of Nemtsov's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She said federal authorities also had surveillance cameras near the Kremlin that are not under her organization's control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Still, Novikova would not confirm the existence of any video of the killing, saying the police investigation was still underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Meanwhile, TV Center, a station controlled by the Moscow city government, broadcast a poor-resolution video from one of its web cameras that it said showed Nemtsov and his date shortly before he was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The station, which superimposed its own time code on the footage, circled figures it said were Nemtsov and the woman walking across the bridge on a rainy night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A vehicle that TVC identified as a snowplow moved slowly behind the couple, obscuring the view of the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>TV Center then circled what it said was the suspected killer jumping into a passing car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The authenticity of the TVC video could not be independently confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Still, the Ukrainian woman that Nemtsov was with when he was shot - 23-year-old Anna Duritskaya - mentioned in an interview Monday that, after the shooting, she had asked a nearby snowplow driver for an emergency number for the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Investigators say they are looking into several possible motives for the opposition leader's slaying and have offered 3 million rubles (nearly $50,000) for information about it, but so far there have been few leads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Many of Nemtsov's supporters believe the government is responsible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Duritskaya has been under police guard for questioning since early Saturday, but in an interview Monday with the independent Russian TV channel Dozhd she said she had not seen Nemtsov's attacker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I didn't see anything," she told Dozhd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I turned around and all I saw was a light-colored car. I saw neither the brand nor the license plate of the car when it was driving away."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Duritskaya told Dozhd that the snowplow driver drove away after he gave her the police number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Duritskaya, who said she had known Nemtsov for three years, said she had been questioned exhaustively by police and wants to leave the country but Russian investigators will not her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She is now staying at a friend's apartment in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Duritskaya's mother Inna, who spoke to The Associated Press in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, said Monday she had been in touch with her daughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>She said Anna was very upset and she worried that Russian authorities were "putting psychological pressure on her."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I am worried that they want to use her, as a citizen of Ukraine, use her as though this situation is somehow something to do with Ukraine," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"She has absolutely nothing to do with this killing. She was not politically active. She had nothing to do with Boris' political activities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>She has absolutely nothing to do with this killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>She was not politically active.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In Geneva on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the Nemtsov killing a "heinous crime which will be fully investigated."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He told the U.N. Human Rights Council that Putin had "immediately handed down all instructions and is ensuring special control over this investigation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>At the same time he rebuffed outside interference in the probe, saying any "attempt to use the heinous killing of Boris Nemtsov for political purposes is despicable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Tens of thousands of supporters turned out Sunday to march through central Moscow in a silent tribute to Nemtsov, while other supporters mourned him in St. Petersburg and other European cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Prominent Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has asked to be released early from prison so he could attend Nemtsov's funeral, which is being held Tuesday at a human rights center in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Navalny was sentenced on Feb. 20 to 15 days in custody for handing out leaflets for an upcoming protest that was also organized by Nemtsov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>France's foreign minister called Nemtsov's killing an "assassination that was revolting," and called Monday for a serious investigation into it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Laurent Fabius told BFM television the slaying "raises a series of questions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"The fact is that it is not good to be an opposition figure in Russia," Fabius said, noting previous killings of other Russian opposition figures.</td></tr>

<h3>1-800-DOUBTS: A new helpline for troubled atheists</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He's been a Christian for 20 years but can't believe in the Bible anymore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He hasn't told his friends or family and still sits, uneasy, in church each Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I feel like I'm lying," he tells the woman on the other end of the phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I'm pretending to be a person that I'm not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"But what if I'm wrong?" he asks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Will I go to hell?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Hmmm..." the woman says, after stumbling through an awkward answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I thought you weren't going to make this hard."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If this call had been real, the woman says, she would have dissuaded the man from falling for Pascal's Wager, the argument that it's better to believe in God because -- well, hell is an awfully hot place to spend eternity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the call wasn't real.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The man and woman are volunteers training for 1-84-I-DOUBT-IT, believed to be the country's first helpline for people wrestling with religion, suffering from a loss of faith, or confused about why their son or wife seems to have suddenly embraced atheism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Founded by the group Recovering From Religion and cobbled together with a small budget, the helpline launched on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nearly 100 volunteers are ready to field calls 24/7 on the weekends and from 6-12 Central Time on weeknights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Calls will be kept confidential and the callers can remain anonymous, said Sarah Morehead, Recovering From Religion's executive director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The volunteer agents, who are not licensed counselors or therapists, will not steer callers toward atheism, Morehead said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Rather, they will offer a sympathetic ear and practical tips for finding secular or religious communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>One script they can use, for example, asks callers about their beliefs and matches them with local congregations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Other guidelines direct callers with serious problems to secular therapists or, if necessary, a suicide hotline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Morehead said the helpline grew out of the hundreds of calls and emails Recovering From Religion receives from people troubled by deep questions about God, the afterlife and faith -- but who fear exposing their anxieties to friends, family members or ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Without a lifeline or support network, many former religious believers sink into depression or suffer from other emotional issues, Morehead said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Many people feel isolated or rejected when they begin to ask questions," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"If churches suddenly started welcoming doubters to their potlucks, the hot line project wouldn't be necessary."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Steve Harrington, executive director of the International Association of Peer Specialists, said groups like Recovering from Religion are popping up around the country, largely because the health care system seems to focus more on treating symptoms than patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Peer-to-peer counseling, Harrington said, takes the opposite approach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Peer supporters ask questions but don't provide answers. They help people find their own answers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Peer counseling's greatest strength, experts say, is the sense of shared experience, the common characteristics between the person seeking help and the person offering it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Who can more softly bind the wound of another as he who has felt the same wound himself?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Harrington said, quoting Thomas Jefferson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Nearly 7.5 million Americans belong to one of the country's 500,000 self-help groups, according to one estimate, and there are niches for nearly every mental and physical ailment, from women who have trouble breastfeeding to veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Many of them have hot lines, but Harrington said he couldn't recall any other helpline like Recovering From Religion's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>You could argue that religion is the original peer support network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Millennia before "self-help" was coined, Buddhist sanghas, Hindu ashrams and Jewish synagogues welcomed seekers of all stripes, providing pilgrims, outcasts and devotees with sacred spaces to share customs and communal validation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>But many Americans, particularly the young, have forsaken organized religion in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>According to one well-noted study, nearly a third of millennials are not affiliated with any faith, which potentially leaves a lot of people with a lot of questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In a training class on Wednesday night, volunteers for 1-84-I-DOUBT-IT practiced how to answer questions from the expected kind of calls: the doubting believer, the closeted atheist, the concerned family member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>They also learned how to field calls they won't necessarily welcome: the preacher who wants to debate religion or convert the agents, the silent caller who won't utter a word, the sexualized callers who -- well, you can probably guess.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"We want to end those calls very quickly," said Mark Tilbrook, who led the training session Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Tilbrook, who is from Manchester, England, played the nervous man with doubts who left the woman on the other end of the line stumbling for an answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Parts of the story he told were true, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He was a Christian and continued to attend church even after he lost faith.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"When I left my own faith, I understood why a lot of people would feel quite abandoned, especially if all their friends and family are tied to the church. It can be quite a lonely time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>In addition to the social costs, many lifelong atheists -- and believers, too, for that matter -- underestimate the existential terror that often accompanies the first stages of atheism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>It's not like switching political parties or picking up a new ideology, Tilbrook said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>When you lose faith, you also lose assurance of an afterlife -- the kind of realization that leads to lots sleepless nights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>After reading about Recovering From Religion's hotline plans on Reddit, Tilbrook said he thought his personal and professional background -- he is a helpline counselor in England -- could be useful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>(He asked CNN not to name the help line because its counselors are anonymous.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>As they practiced mock calls, the volunteers -- who were from Seattle, Maryland and Montana -- seemed to find some of the rules easier to follow than others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>One volunteer caught herself offering advice to a woman who wanted to have a secular wedding against her mother's wishes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"You're trying to fix this problem for them," Tilbrook gently admonished the volunteer agent after the mock call ended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"You have to let them fix it themselves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Tilbrook encouraged the volunteers to write the caller's name on a sheet of paper and draw a circle around it, a reminder that the conversation should center on the person, not the problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Earlier, he had taught the volunteers how to ask questions without seeming like an interrogator, wrap up rambling diatribes without speaking harshly, and sound sympathetic without stooping to condescension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>A volunteer may have an intense conversation with a caller, walking with him through stressful situations and growing emotionally invested in the outcome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>And then, after the conversation ends, the two will likely never speak again, with the volunteer left to wonder how the caller's ordeal ended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>It's like watching a movie, Tilbrook said, and stopping it midway.</td></tr>
