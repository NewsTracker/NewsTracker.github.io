<h3>Ukraine peace deal brokered by European leaders</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Several regional analysts predicted a surge of violence in eastern Ukraine ahead of Sunday morning's deadline for a cease-fire - as the Ukrainian military and separatists forces seek to expand their lines before the shooting is supposed to stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Publicly, U.S. administration officials welcomed the deal and commended German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande for fashioning a diplomatic solution designed end the fighting that has killed more than 5,300 in eastern Ukraine since April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Western leaders and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko negotiated late into the night with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Belarus Wednesday before announcing the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But behind the scenes, U.S. officials said they were wary about the prospects for the cease-fire to last.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are concerned that the fighting continues," one senior Obama administration official told reporters on background Thursday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We are also concerned about reports of new heavy weapons [moving] into Ukraine from the Russian side, including reports today."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While the official said the agreement was "absolutely essential to get the fighting stopped," U.S. officials fear that a sustainable peace may still be out of reach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The first thing is to have a real cease-fire and a real pullback & After that comes this very complex political process," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"That will require a lot of continued work and a lot of continued negotiation by the various parties."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr. Putin in agreeing to the deal put on the back-burner any talk of sending such U.S. offensive military equipment as armor piercing weapons to Kiev - a subject of intense debate in the White House recently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This agreement has probably put on hold any kind of new sanctions or other action against Russia from Washington," said Boris Zilberman, who is following the situation closely at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"That might be Putin's goal - that he can solidify his gains in eastern Ukraine while blunting our options."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Steven Pifer, a former ambassador to Ukraine and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, noted in a blogpost Thursday that both sides are likely to try to maximize their position in the next two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Under the agreement, the cease-fire will be followed by the creation of a buffer zone between 35 and 80 miles wide over the coming two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"If the cease-fire holds - a very big if," wrote Mr. Pifer, "the next immediate step will be withdrawal of heavy weapons away from the line of contact."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr. Putin told reporters Thursday that the deal envisages special status for Ukraine's separatist regions, while Mr. Poroshenko maintained there was no consensus on any sort of autonomy or federalization for eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Obama administration officials said the next step would be talks between Kiev and rebel leaders toward the "implementation of interim self-government in the special status area" - territory now controlled by the rebels in the eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>There would then be a potential vote toward autonomy for the area, although it would still remain part of Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>If and when the vote is resolved, Ukraine's government, and presumably its military, would be allowed retake control of the nation's border with Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While uncertainty remains, the collective powers of the Western world appeared to throw their weight behind the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Within hours of its announcement, the International Monetary Fund agreed to give Ukraine's struggling government a new bailout package worth $17.5 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The World Bank said it was ready to commit up to $2 billion.</td></tr>

<h3>Numbed by Snow, Boston Area Shudders at the Thought of More</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At Singing Beach, about 30 miles to the northeast, a front-end loader worked nonstop to deposit tons of snow into the ocean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And on almost any street in town, frigid residents continue to do battle with vast mountains of snow, with more expected this weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After three major storms in three weeks pushed snowfall for this season to 78.5 inches in Boston and broke records for snowfall here over 14-day and 30-day periods, removing the snow has become a test of endurance, ingenuity and will across New England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"You've got to make room for this snow to go somewhere," said Peter Judge, the public information officer for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There's a sense of urgency with this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The situation has been compounded by reinforcing bouts of frigid air that have kept snow from melting on its own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Mother Nature just has not helped out in the snow-melting department," said Alan Dunham, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's forecast office in Taunton, Mass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>So removal is up to man and machine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The problem is especially daunting in Boston, where old, narrow streets leave no room for the snow to go, snow mountains are taller than the residents trying to throw snow on them, and cars have long since disappeared into snow banks, only their wing mirrors reaching out like outstretched hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Snow removal is our top priority in the city of Boston right now," Mayor Martin J. Walsh said on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Hundreds of trucks have been collecting snow at night and hauling it to snow farms - which are piles of snow, sometimes the size of a large city block, on vacant land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The city expanded the number of snow farms this week to 10 from five, and on Thursday it announced it was getting reinforcements: additional snow removal teams from Connecticut, a group of National Guard soldiers, and a loan of two more snow melters from New York City, bringing the total in the city to four.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Wednesday night, excavators, bulldozers and front-end loaders roamed over the mountain of snow at the snow farm on Tide Street, in the Seaport district, long after dark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A snow melter, which sends resulting water to the city's water treatment plant, waited nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>And in densely populated South Boston, cars were towed so that dump trucks could pick up ever more snow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Talk about inconvenience," grumbled Mark Senna, 47, a software engineer who had scrambled to move his car before towing began, and who could not find a different space in the neighborhood because there was too much snow around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I don't really know what we could do with it," said Parker Hayes, 23, a real estate agent who was shoveling out his girlfriend's car, throwing snow atop a snowbank taller than he was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He added, "It's overwhelming."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The city, apparently, is open to new ideas, as it was in 1948, when Mayor James M. Curley wrote to the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Karl Compton, asking if engineers there could study whether flamethrowers or chemicals might help with the snow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>(Mr. Compton declined, and suggested plain old salt.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Earlier this week, the city's Office of New Urban Mechanics reached out to professors and companies, seeking innovative ways of dealing with the snow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Carlo Ratti, the director of the Senseable City Lab at M.I.T., said in an interview that he saw potential in sensors and automated technology, which he studies in his lab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The autonomous system that you use today, mostly for cars and drones, can be easily applied, the same system, to snowplows," Dr. Ratti said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He imagined that someday, automated snowplows could be equipped with sensors for the road conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>That day, however, is not today, and with snow farms filling up around the state, some communities say they simply have no more room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As of Thursday morning, nearly 30 had notified the state's Department of Environmental Protection that they would or might dump snow in the ocean or other waterways, a practice that is considered a last resort because snow often contains trash, grit and other debris that can damage the environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Manchester-by-the-Sea, northeast of Boston, is one of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We've put it at the compost site in town. We've put it in the beach parking lot, other parking lots," said Carol Murray, the director of the town's Department of Public Works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"We're just full to the brim."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on February 13, 2015, on page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: Numbed by Snow, Boston Area Shudders at the Thought of More.</td></tr>
