<h3>Old rivals Red Sox and Yankees tied at 5 in 19th inning (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Boston took a 6-5 lead in the 19th on a sacrifice fly by Mookie Betts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Xander Bogaerts scored after reaching on his fourth hit of extra innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chase Headley and Mark Teixeira hit tying home runs for the Yankees in a game interrupted by a power outage for 16 minutes in the 12th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>David Ortiz hit a solo homer for Boston to break a 3-all deadlock in the 16th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But then Teixeira, batting from the right side against right-handed knuckleballer Steven Wright, led off the bottom half with a no-doubt drive to left field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Pablo Sandoval put the Red Sox back in front with an RBI single in the 18th only to see Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran hit doubles in the bottom half to tie it again at 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The longest game in the history of the new Yankee Stadium, which opened in 2009, pushed past 2 a.m. on the East Coast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The teams get little chance to rest, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Each club went to its final reliever in the 15th during the longest game for the Yankees by innings since a 19-inning victory over Minnesota in August 1976.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The longest game between the teams was a 20-inning win by Boston in the second game of a 1967 doubleheader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Headley's solo shot off fill-in closer Edward Mujica came with two outs in the bottom of the ninth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Neither team could break through again until Ortiz launched an 0-2 pitch from Esmil Rogers to right-center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It was the slugger's first home run of the year and his 50th against the Yankees, including playoff games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Rogers threw 35 pitches the previous night, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Didi Gregorius had a chance to win it for New York in the 16th and 18th, but grounded out with a runner at third to end both innings.</td></tr>
