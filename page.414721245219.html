<h3>British hostage John Cantlie held by Isil tells family not to expect to see him alive again</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In comments made in an article for Isil's online propaganda magazine, John Cantlie said it was time for his loved ones to "let him go" and "get on with their lives".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The message appeared to be urging Mr Cantlie's family to give up on their publicity campaign and behind-the-scenes efforts to get him freed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>His son, 44, was kidnapped while reporting in Syria in November 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He is now believed to be the only one of the various Britons kidnapped by Isil who is still alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Two British aid workers who were kidnapped by the group, David Haines and Alan Henning, were killed last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Cantlie, who has appeared in a series of propaganda videos for Isil, made his latest comments in the magazine Dabiq, a slickly-produced Isil mouthpiece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He thanked friends and relatives for trying to get him released, and criticised the British government for refusing to pay a ransom for him, a tactic that some other European governments have used to free Isil hostages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is not possible to say whether Mr Cantlie definitely authored the article, or to what extent it was written under duress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His talk of closure with his family followed comments in his most recent broadcast, released last week, that it would be &#x201c;the last film in this series&#x201d;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That may raise fears of an imminent threat to his life.</td></tr>
