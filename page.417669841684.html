<h3>What's holding up a deal on Greece's bailout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A woman looks a front store as a worker paints the wall of a shop in the northern Greek port city of Thessaloniki, Wednesday, June 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece has three weeks left to conclude a deal with its creditors before its bailout program expires at the end of the month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It is desperate for the disbursal of the final 7.2 billion euros in rescue loans, without which it cannot continue to repay its international debts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An elderly woman holds shopping bags as she leaves from a market area in the northern Greek port city of Thessaloniki, Wednesday, June 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - The ball is in Greece's court, its creditors say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But this isn't tennis - unless you can imagine a match between argumentative snails, coached by committee, without an umpire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>After four and a half months of back and forth, Greece and its creditors remain far from a deal on what reforms the country must make to get more rescue loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It needs the money to avoid defaulting on its debts and save itself from an even nastier mess, like falling out of the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The radical left-led government in Athens started off boldly in January, making pie-in-the-sky promises to Greeks to make life easy again by rolling back cuts and reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On the other hand, the creditors - fellow eurozone states and International Monetary Fund - are little inclined to budge from the policies they have pushed on Greece for five years: heavy cuts that have succeeded in taming government spending but otherwise mauled the economy and society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Creditors want cuts worth 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion) to pensions this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They also want Greece to end state financing now for auxiliary pensions - a top-up to pensions that many Greeks receive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Greece refuses both measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Creditors also wants to immediately make it more difficult to qualify for early retirement, whereas the government in Athens is offering a staggered increase in the required age and other measures to make early retirement less generous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>There are currently three rates of tax on the sale of goods: 6.5, 13 and 23 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Creditors want two rates, 11 and 23 percent, which would automatically hike the cost of most food, medicine, electricity bills and - in a tourism-reliant economy - hotels and restaurants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Greece is proposing rates of 6.5, 12 and 23 percent, with key consumer staples, hotels and restaurants in the low and middle brackets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Greek government wants to restore the minimum wage from around 580 euros ($654) monthly to 750 euros ($846) by the end of next year - it had initially promised to do that promptly after its election - and reintroduce collective wage negotiating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Creditors reject that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Creditors want primary budget surpluses - which exclude interest payments on debt - of 1, 2 and 3 percent of GDP for 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The government is offering 0.75, 1.75 and 2 percent of GDP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Because the country is back in recession and GDP is shrinking, any surplus will require substantial belt-tightening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The elephant in the room, for creditors, seems to be Greece's bloated debt - a daunting 317 billion euros ($358 billion), or 176 percent of the country's annual economic output.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Tsipras' government insists it won't sign an agreement unless it contains some provision on debt relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Creditors promised last year to discuss the issue, but never did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>None of the recent proposals leaked from the creditors mention debt relief.</td></tr>
