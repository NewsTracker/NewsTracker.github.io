<h3>Greece backs waste facility on newly-privatized Athens plot</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) " Greece's Finance Ministry says it wants to grant a chunk of a recently-privatized Athens coastal plot earmarked for luxury development to be used as a municipal waste management facility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Deputy Finance Minister Nadia Valavani said Wednesday it was "necessary" to hand the 1.2-hectare (3-acre) area to municipalities surrounding the former Athens airport, which was a key part of Greece's limping privatization program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The entire 620-hectare (1,530-acre) plot was sold last year to a Greek real estate company for 915 million euros ($1 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The company plans to build luxury residential, commercial, sports and recreation facilities, and a 200-hectare (494-acre) park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The four-month-old radical left-led government initially opposed Greece's privatization program, which was demanded by bailout creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It has softened its stance, but remains ambivalent on the former airport deal.</td></tr>
