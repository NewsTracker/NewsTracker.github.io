<h3>Appeals court: Apple must submit to imposition of monitor</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - A federal appeals panel has refused to disqualify a court-appointed monitor after a judge found Apple colluded with book publishers in 2010 to raise electronic book prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled against Apple Inc. Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The three-judge panel concluded that a judge did not act improperly when she declined Apple's request to disqualify a monitor she had appointed to evaluate Apple's antitrust policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A lawyer for Apple, based in Cupertino, California, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 2nd Circuit did not yet rule on a separate appeal in which Apple is challenging the judge's finding that it colluded with publishers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>After a 2013 civil trial, a judge ordered the technology giant to modify contracts with publishers to prevent price fixing.</td></tr>
