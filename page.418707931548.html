<h3>Apple gives weak forecast, shares fall nearly 7 percent</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BENGALURU/SAN FRANCISCO Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares slumped nearly 7 percent in after-hours trading as its fourth-quarter revenue forecast fell short of estimates and it missed some targets for iPhone sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The shares dropped to $121 after the company released its results on Tuesday, from $130.75 at the close.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The forecast overshadowed Apple's strong sales in China, which more than doubled to $13.23 billion from a year earlier.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Without disclosing specific figures, Maestri said sales of the Apple Watch beat the company's expectations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He noted that in the nine weeks since its launch in late April, the device has sold better than either iPhones or iPads over a similar period after their launch.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>"Where are you going to find growth in the world?" he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"You've done an amazing job sucking all the smartphone profits into your balance sheet, but smartphone sales are slowing. What's going to happen when the industry matures, just like PCs did?"</td></tr>
