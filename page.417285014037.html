<h3>Germany sees progress on Greece, EU officals to confer on Thursday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN/BRUSSELS, May 26 (Reuters) - A senior German official said on Tuesday there was no reason to believe Greece would be in default after a 300 million euro payment to the IMF falls due on June 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Separately, euro zone officials said deputy finance ministers would hold a teleconference on Thursday to follow up on days of negotiations between representatives of Greece and creditors the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank and the European Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece must repay four loans totalling 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) to the IMF next month, starting with a 300 million euro payment on June 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If no deal is reached within EU/IMF for new loans to be disbursed to Athens, Greece is likely to default on the IMF loan repayment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This would start a process that could lead Greece out of the euro zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But in Berlin a senior German official, speaking on condition of not being named, said it was encouraging that Greece had signalled its desire to meet the looming debt obligations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I find it encouraging, if it is true, that the Greeks signalled yesterday their desire to repay the 300 million euros to the IMF on June 5," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I think there is reason to believe that we will not be talking about a default situation around June 5, neither before or immediately thereafter."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Talks between Greece and its creditors on more funding have been dragging on since late January, when the left-wing government of Alexis Tsipras took power on promises of ending austerity and reversing some reforms agreed with the creditors by the previous government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Despite progress on other issues, a deal cannot yet be reached because the creditors believe that to repay its huge public debt, Greece should be running a higher primary surplus, or the balance before debt servicing costs, than Athens is prepared to accept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>To achieve that surplus, the creditors believe Greece should raise its Value Added Tax rate and balance its pensions budget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greece, however, believes a lower primary surplus would make the economy grow faster, increasing the chances of the creditors getting repaid.</td></tr>
