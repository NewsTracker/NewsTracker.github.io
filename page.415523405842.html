<h3>UPDATE 2-Super Mario to go mobile as Nintendo ventures into smartphone games</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nintendo, which already warned its annual operating profit would halve on weak console sales, said on Tuesday it was teaming up with online gaming firm DeNA Co Ltd to develop and operate gaming apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The two companies will also launch later this year an online membership service accessible on mobile devices as well as Nintendo's existing Wii U console and the portable 3DS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"This will allow us to build a bridge between smart devices and gaming consoles," Nintendo President Satoru Iwata told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It doesn't mean smart devices will eat away at gaming consoles, it will create an entirely new type of demand."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company had so far resisted these calls, pinning its hopes on hit games such as "Mario Kart 8".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But in January, it halved its operating earnings target for the fiscal year through March to 20 billion yen ($169 million), citing weak 3DS sales in the year-end holiday season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Under the parternship, Nintendo and DeNA would buy 22 billion yen worth of shares in each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As a result, Nintendo will acquire a 10 percent stake in DeNA while DeNA will acquire a 1.2 percent stake in Nintendo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Although Iwata didn't disclose any details about Nintendo's first mobile game, he said it would not be a hand-me-down from the company's famed console titles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He also said Nintendo was currently developing NX, a new gaming platform, but declined to give further details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>For DeNA, which grew from a startup launched in 1999 to a major online gaming company, a tie-up with Nintendo will help it regain momentum lost in the past two years as users moved on to more popular gaming apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>DeNA mainly develops games played on browsers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As a result of the capital alliance, Nintendo will become the second largest shareholder of DeNA after its founder, Tomoko Namba, who has a 13.1 percent stake.</td></tr>

<h3>Professor arrested for ranting, smoking on airplane</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Pennsylvania college professor got arrested for launching into a recorded rant about U.S. relations with Venezuela halfway through a flight from Latin America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The United States has declared war on Venezuela! The United States has declared war on Venezuela! Venezuela has been declared a national security threat!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Penn State-Abington professor Karen Halnon yells in one clip that went viral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The sociology prof, who also lit a cigarette on the plane, was unapologetic about the uproar when speaking with the Daily News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I found it urgent to speak up against the aggression in Venezuela," said Halnon, 52.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"If you have to shake up a few people, they need to be shaken up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Halnon started shouting in the middle of a 2 1/2-hour flight from Managua, Nicaragua, to Miami, Fla., on Saturday, the Miami New Times reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>One passenger filmed the impromptu lecture on a phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"My great hero, Hugo Chavez, nationalized the oil supply so that the people would own the oil," she shouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Not ExxonMobil. Tell ExxonMobil to go away."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Another video from the same passenger shows Halnon lighting a cigarette in her seat and taking a few puffs, which is not allowed on airlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Halnon told the Daily News her illegal light was meant to be "a symbol for a smoking gun," and also a way to show her affinity with tobacco-loving "revolutionaries" like Fidel Castro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I know that might sound somewhat esoteric to other people, but I'm an intellectual, so that's what I intended," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She said she was returning from a research trip to Nicaragua, and suddenly spoke up on the plane because she was outraged by President Obama's executive order last week ordering sanctions on seven Venezuelan officials for human rights violations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Halnon was arrested upon landing and charged with disorderly conduct, Local10 reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She was released and returned home Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She claimed to the Daily News that was she mistreated by FBI and Transportation and Security Administration officials after her arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She said authorities denied her bathroom use, refused phone calls to family and verbally threatened her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Officials from the FBI's Miami branch and the Miami-Dade County Department of Corrections were not immediately available for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A spokesman for Penn State-Abington, in response to a request for comment, told The News school officials are "aware of Dr. Karen Halnon's behavior" and are "looking into the matter."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Halnon has been teaching sociology at Penn State-Abington since 1999, according to her biography on the college's website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She previously taught at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, and at the University of Vermont in Burlington.</td></tr>
