<h3>Home runs by Cruz, Morrison lead Mariners to win over Angels</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>So if this is going to be a thing for Nelson Cruz and Logan Morrison, maybe they should have some runners on base when it happens to maximize the effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>For the third time this season, Nelson Cruz and Logan Morrison homered in the same inning - belting solo shots in the seventh inning of Seattle's 3-2 victory Monday over the Los Angeles Angels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The duo did it twice during the Mariners' miserable series against the Houston Astros, but unlike the defeats in Houston, the Mariners prevailed Monday, snapping a four-game losing streak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On a night when the Mariners were just fighting to get a runner on base against Angels starter Matt Shoemaker, the solos would suffice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Shoemaker had been cruising along for six innings, allowing just one hit - a Kyle Seager single to left in the second inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Shoemaker was up 1-2 on Cruz, but he left a changeup over the inside part of the plate belt-high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cruz yanked a line drive well inside the left-field foul pole for his 14th homer of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cruz is just one of five players in MLB history to hit 14 homers in his first 26 games of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Two batters later, Morrison jumped all over a 1-0 changeup from Shoemaker, depositing it into the right field seats to make it 2-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A 2-0 lead seemed like plenty for Mariners' starter Felix Hernandez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Heck, he's used to working with less.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Seattle ace let his lead get trimmed to 2-1 when he left a fastball over the plate on a 3-1 count to Matt Joyce for a solo homer to right center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the Mariners answered Joyce's solo shot with another of their own when Seth Smith hit a homer to right center to make it 3-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Mariners have hit 34 homers this season and 27 have come with the bases empty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That one run became very important because closer Fernando Rodney made things interesting in the ninth, giving up a solo home run to David Freese to make it 3-2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He then walked Joyce to put the tying run on first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But the game ended moments later when pinch runner Collin Cowgill attempted to steal second base on the first pitch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Instead, Mike Zunino fired a perfect throw to second to get Cowgill with ease for the final out of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Rodney got his eighth save of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Hernandez improved to 5-0 on the season working seven innings, giving up one run on six hits with a walk and eight strikeouts to lower his ERA to 1.73.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He wasn't invincible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Angels had some scoring chances against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In the fourth inning, they had runners on first and second with two outs, but Joyce's hard fly ball to right field was run down by Cruz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In the sixth inning, Mike Trout led off with a single on a poorly located 0-2 changeup from Hernandez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But any potential trouble was averted when the Mariners doubled off a stealing Trout at first base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Albert Pujols hit a liner to right field, which was easily caught by Cruz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Trout tried to retreat and get back safely, but Cruz's strong throw was gloved on the short hop by Morrison for the double play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Threat averted.</td></tr>
