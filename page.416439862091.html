<h3>Still Got It: Facebook Mobile Ad Revenue Continues to Surge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nearly three-quarters of Facebook's advertising revenue now comes from mobile ads, as many more users access the social network on smartphones and other handheld gadgets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Facebook, which bought the popular photo-sharing app Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp, has been coming out with its own stand-alone mobile apps to capture more of the time people spend on phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Besides its Messenger app, though, Facebook home-grown efforts have had limited success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Wednesday, the company introduced Hello, a voice-calling app designed for Android phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In essence, it's meant to replace the voice dialer on your phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But based on Facebook's failure to take over the home screen with its Home app for Android, users may not be too keen on replacing existing smartphone tools with Facebook-branded versions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Facebook finance chief David Wehner said mobile "continues to be a key driver" of Facebook's growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He called Creative Labs an experimental platform to launch apps and said Facebook will continue to experiment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For now, the money-making focus is on Facebook itself and, slowly, on popular, established apps such as Instagram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In the previous quarter, mobile represented 69 percent of total advertising revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That percentage has grown steadily since Facebook began showing mobile ads in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The company reported adjusted earnings of 42 cents per share in the January-March quarter, above the 41 cents per share that analysts polled by FactSet were expecting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Revenue increased 46 percent to $3.54 billion, from $2.5 billion a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Analysts had expected $3.56 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Net income declined as Facebook's expenses grew 83 percent from a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The company earned $512 million, or 18 cents per share, down 20 percent from $642 million, or 25 cents per share.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Facebook, which is based in Menlo Park, California, had 1.44 billion monthly active users as of March, up 13 percent from a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The number of users who accessed Facebook on mobile devices at least once a month grew 24 percent to 1.25 billion.</td></tr>
