<h3>U.S. Supreme Court rejects Obamacare 'death panel' challenge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The high court left intact a ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that threw out the lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The court's action in an unsigned order was a victory for Obama administration, which has faced a barrage of legal challenges to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The court is currently weighing a separate case challenging health insurance subsidies that are key to Obamacare's implementation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A ruling is due by the end of June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the case that the justices rejected on Monday, Arizona-based business owner Nick Coons and Dr. Eric Novack, an orthopedic surgeon, sued in 2011 in litigation backed by a conservative legal group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Among other things, they challenged the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, a 15-member government panel dubbed by some Republicans as a "death panel" because of its intended role in trimming costs within Medicare, the government healthcare program for the elderly and disabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Lower courts threw out the lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In its August 2014 ruling, the appeals court said that the plaintiffs had not shown they had suffered any harm that they could sue over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On the IPAB claim, the court noted that under the terms of the healthcare law, the board acts only if Medicare spending increases at a certain level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The earliest it could ever take any action that could potentially reduce Novack's Medicare reimbursements would be in 2019.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The plaintiffs, represented by the Phoenix, Arizona-based conservative Goldwater Institute, also challenged a provision of the law, known as the individual mandate, that requires Americans to obtain health insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Those claims were also rejected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The case on which the court acted on is Coons v.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Lew, U.S. Supreme Court, No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>14-525.</td></tr>
