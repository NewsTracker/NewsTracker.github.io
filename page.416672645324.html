<tr><td>10</td><td>Nepalese soldiers dig for a rumored missing person in the rubble of a collapsed house in the Manakamana village known for its spiritual Hindu temple, near the epicenter of last week's massive earthquake, in the Gorkha District of Nepal, Friday, May 1, 2015.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have received things like tuna fish and mayonnaise. What good are those things for us? We need grains, salt and sugar," Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat told reporters Friday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>"Of course we are worried that it is taking so long to get to people who desperately need aid. Some of those villages are virtually flattened. But it's very, very hard to see how we're going to get to them," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Some villagers might be able to walk to a place where the aid helicopters could land, but that would be of little help to those who are injured, she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Tents and tarpaulins are the most urgent need, but there's also a demand for water, food, health care and better sanitation.</td></tr>
