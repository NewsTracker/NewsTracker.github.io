<tr><td>62</td><td>Women were barred from leaving their homes without permission, and as most of the men had been killed or conscripted into Boko Haram, this left them completely dependent on their children or the fighters for food and water.</td></tr>

<tr><td>72</td><td>'Men and women, boys and girls, Christians and Muslims, have been killed, abducted and brutalised by Boko Haram during a reign of terror which has affected millions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>The report also highlights growing tensions between Christians and Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Many Christians interviewed by Amnesty believe that Muslims have informed Boko Haram of their whereabouts or failed to share information about impending attacks and this has left a legacy of distrust between communities that previously lived harmoniously side-by-side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>Whilst Boko Haram has destroyed churches and killed Christians who refuse to convert to Islam, they have also targeted moderate Muslims.</td></tr>
