<h3>17 million gain coverage under Obamacare</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As a result of the landmark health-reform law known as the Affordable Care Act, nearly 17 million previously uninsured Americans now have health coverage, a new analysis reveals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Rand Corporation's 2013-2015 report said increases were observed across all types of insurance, from employer-provided health plans to Medicaid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Employer-sponsored health plans showed the biggest gain, with 9.6 million newly enrolled as a result of the health care legislation, sometimes called Obamacare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Another 6.5 million were newly enrolled in Medicaid, the publicly financed health plan for the poor, and 4.1 million were covered through newly created insurance marketplaces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The report also said 2.7 million were insured through non-marketplace plans and other sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The findings, published online May 6 in the journal Health Affairs, are based on a survey of about 1,600 Americans aged 18 to 64.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But not everyone is impressed with the findings, among them Dr. Ida Hellander, director of health policy and programs at Physicians for a National Health Program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"These findings hide some larger problems in our health care system," Hellander said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>By Rand's own measure, about 33 million people remain uninsured in 2015, the fifth year after passage of the Affordable Care Act when about 50 million Americans lacked insurance, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hellander also pointed to a Congressional Budget Office prediction that at least 27 million will remain uninsured over the next 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Many others are under-insured, she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>According to the report, 22.8 million uninsured people became insured and 5.9 million lost coverage from September 2013 to February 2015, when the second open enrollment period ended for Obamacare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This translates to a gain of 16.9 million newly insured Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Growth of employer-sponsored coverage proves fears that employers would drop insurance plans were unfounded, Carman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>This also suggests employer-based coverage will remain the primary source of health insurance, she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Despite some insurance gains, Hellander is concerned that many people are under-insured in the wake of the Affordable Care Act, which was enacted in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"While this study found a slight uptick in the proportion of workers with coverage, the long-term trend has been less coverage and a shift in benefits towards skimpier policies or so-called high-deductible health plans requiring large co-pays and deductibles," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Instead of spreading risk, companies shift it to patients."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>This is also true of private plans sold on the health exchanges, Hellander said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"About 20 percent of the plans are so-called bronze plans that only cover 60 percent of health costs and have deductibles as high as $5,000. Some don't even cover a prescription until the deductible is met," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"People have insurance, but can't afford care," Hellander said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We need to eliminate cost-sharing and adopt an improved Medicare for all."</td></tr>
