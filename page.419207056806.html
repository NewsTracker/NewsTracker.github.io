<h3>State of emergency declared in Ferguson after shooting anniversary violence</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Authorities have declared a state of emergency in Ferguson after a night of unrest, as a teenager was charged with shooting at police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a statement, St Louis County executive Steve Stenger said county police would immediately take charge of "police emergency management" in Ferguson and surrounding districts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"In light of last night's violence and unrest in the city of Ferguson, and the potential for harm to persons and property, I am exercising my authority as county executive to issue a state of emergency, effective immediately," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His statement was issued as an 18-year-old Tyrone Harris was charged in connection with a shootout in Ferguson on Sunday after a day of peaceful protests marking one year since the police shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Harris was critically wounded and is being treated in hospital, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>St Louis County prosecutors said in a statement that Harris was charged on four counts, including "assault on law enforcement" and shooting at a motor vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His bond was set at $250,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On a day of civil disobedience called by activists in Missouri on Monday, several people were arrested after jumping barricades at a courthouse in St Louis, news video reports showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Hours after Sunday night's shooting, clergy and civil rights activists led more than 100 people in a rally through St Louis' city streets, shouting "this is what democracy looks like" and "black lives matter".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Earlier in Ferguson, volleys of gunshots rang out as police in riot gear tried to disperse demonstrators blocking traffic and smashing storefront windows along a street that was a flashpoint of riots last year after Brown, 18, was shot dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Missouri governor Jay Nixon called Sunday's violence "a sad turn of events" carried out by a criminal element.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Nixon, who had deployed the National Guard to quell violence last year, did not make any mention of additional security for rallies on Monday planned in and around Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"For the sake of all, it is my hope and expectation that today's events will be peaceful so that these efforts can continue to move the region in a positive direction," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Activist groups said Harris was shot by plain clothes police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Photo: Protesters fall to the ground to take cover after shots are fired during protests in Ferguson, Missouri on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It was a poor decision to use plain clothes officers in a protest setting because it made it difficult for people to identify police officers, which is essential to the safety of community members," said Kayla Reed, a field organiser with the Organisation of Black Struggle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The death of Brown and a grand jury's decision to spare the officer, Darren Wilson, from criminal charges led to a wave of demonstrations that boiled over into rioting and arson at times and spawned sympathy rallies across the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Brown's death also prompted greater scrutiny of racial bias within the US criminal justice system, giving rise to the "Black Lives Matter" movement that gained momentum from other high-profile killings of unarmed minorities by white police in cities such as New York, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Cincinnati and most recently Arlington, Texas.</td></tr>
