<tr><td>2</td><td>London: Britain has pulled out agents from live operations in "hostile countries" after Russia and China cracked top-secret information contained in files leaked by former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, the Sunday Times reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Security service MI6, which operates overseas and is tasked with defending British interests, has removed agents from certain countries, the newspaper said, citing unnamed officials at the office of British Prime Minister David Cameron, the Home Office and security services.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>The US wants Mr Snowden to stand trial after he leaked classified documents, fled the country and was eventually granted asylum in Moscow in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He went to Russia via Hong Kong and, although he claimed in 2013 that the encrypted files remained secure, Britain believed both Russia and China had cracked documents that contain details that could allow British and American spies to be identified, the newspaper said, citing officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, an official at Mr Cameron's office was quoted as saying that there was "no evidence of anyone being harmed".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A spokeswoman at Mr Cameron's office declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A Home Office source told the newspaper that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not grant Mr Snowden asylum for nothing.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>The Russian and Chinese governments were not immediately available for comment.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>Conservative lawmaker and former minister Andrew Mitchell said the timing of the report was "no accident".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"There is a big debate going on," he told BBC radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We are going to have legislation bought back to Parliament ... about the way in which individual liberty and privacy is invaded in the interest of collective national security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"That's a debate we certainly need to have."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Cameron has promised a swathe of new security measures, including more powers to monitor Britons' communications and online activity in what critics have dubbed a "snoopers' charter".</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Britain's terrorism laws reviewer David Anderson said on Thursday the current system was "undemocratic, unnecessary and, in the long run, intolerable".</td></tr>
