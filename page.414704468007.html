<h3>What's in the Ukraine ceasefire agreement</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The agreement, hammered out after overnight discussions between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany, would allow for the removal of heavy weaponry from the front and constitutional reforms that will grant more powers to rebel regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It could allow Ukraine to hold on to its restive eastern regions, where 5,300 people have died since April, while also giving Russia strong leverage to keep Ukraine from moving closer to the West.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's unclear, however, whether the agreement, which is set to go into effect on Sunday, will last.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The previous ceasefire collapsed shortly after it was signed in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This is a huge win for Russia," said Aurel Braun, a professor of political science with University of Toronto and Harvard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The ceasefire agreement would allow for the removal of heavy weaponry from the front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The key thing here is not the rebels," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"What I would emphasize is that we are mistaken if we look at rebel strategies. This is a Russian strategy, there is no rebel strategy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Braun said one of Ukraine's primary successes was simply bringing an end to the bloodshed and giving it time to regroup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that the agreement contains "a clear commitment to withdraw all foreign troops, all mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine," a reference to the Russian soldiers and weapons that Ukraine and the West say Russia has sent into eastern Ukraine to back the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Moscow denies the claim, saying any Russians in Ukraine are volunteers, although observers say it is almost certainly providing men and weapons to the rebel groups in the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The deal calls for Ukraine to regain control of its borders along its eastern frontier with Russia that is currently controlled by the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This could allow Ukraine to halt the flow of Russian materiel into the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Moscow opposed this provision, saying it could lead to the encirclement of the rebel forces, The Guardian reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, this is only set to be completed by the end of 2015, after Ukraine has completed reforms that would grant "special status" to the rebel-held regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It's unclear if the ceasefire will hold that long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In a key concession to Russia, the agreement calls for Ukraine to implement constitutional reforms granting wide powers to the eastern regions, including the right to form their own police force and trade freely with Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"They gain a kind of legitimacy by being able to control those territories," Braun said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>However, Kyiv has stressed that there was no agreement on any autonomy or federalization for eastern Ukraine, a longtime demand of Russia that wants it to maintain leverage over its neighbour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Rebel leaders lauded the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"[We] give this chance to Ukraine to change its constitution, to change its attitude," Igor Plotnitsky, rebel leader in Luhansk, said on Russian television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The rebel regions will hold local elections, according to the terms of the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A similar vote held last year was denounced by Ukraine and the West as a sham.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>According to Braun, this could actually strengthen the rebels' position because they will be able to take control of the elections and guarantee a strong showing for the secessionist cause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It's unclear what will happen to the Ukrainian forces under siege in the important transport hub of Debaltseve when the ceasefire goes into effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the rebels consider the Ukrainian forces surrounded and expect them to surrender, while Ukraine says its troops have not been blocked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Seizing the city would strengthen the rebels' control of the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"It would be a huge symbolic and strategic loss," Braun said.</td></tr>

<h3>Federal judge orders Alabama official to issue marriage licenses to gay couples</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>US district judge Callie Granade has bolstered her own ruling from three weeks ago that found that Alabama's ban on gay marriages unconstitutional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On Thursday she ordered the probate judge in Mobile, the state's third largest city, to conform to that stricture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Don Davis has kept his probate office in Mobile closed since Monday in defiance of federal instructions to allow same-sex marriages to go ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He has cited the opinion of the chief justice of the state's supreme court, Roy Moore, who has given a counter-order to probate judges that they should not participate in gay marriages, as to do so would be to violate the word of God.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Granade ruled: "Judge Davis may not deny them a license on the ground that plaintiffs constitute same-sex couples or because it is prohibited by the sanctity of marriage."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Davis is one of 44 out of 67 probate judges in Alabama who have joined what amounts to a group revolt against the federal will.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Monday the US supreme court, the highest judicial panel in the land, essentially backed Granade's enforcement of gay marriage in the state pending a full consideration of the issue by the nine justices later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Thursday's development was welcomed by supporters of gay marriage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said: "Today's ruling by Judge Granade provides clear direction to Judge Davis and other probate judges and will help ensure that all same-sex couples in Alabama, regardless of whether they live, have the freedom to marry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Granade's insistence that Davis must bow to her ruling does not bring the dispute to an end by any means.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Her judgement on Thursday applies only to Mobile, and it is not clear that it will be strong enough to bring the other 43 refusenik probate judges to heel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It is not even clear whether Davis himself will now knuckle under.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In a hearing earlier on Thursday, his lawyer told Granade that if she ordered the probate judge to start issuing marriage licenses to gay couples Davis would review the ruling and take "appropriate" action.</td></tr>
