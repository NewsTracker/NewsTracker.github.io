<h3>Australian journalist Peter Greste awaits Egyptian terror-retrial verdict</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australian journalist Peter Greste arrives home after being deported from Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An Egyptian court will decide on Thursday if Australian journalist Peter Greste is convicted in a retrial on terrorism charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Greste's career as a foreign correspondent is on the line, as he awaits the verdict from Cairo at his Brisbane home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The reporter was deported by Egypt in February, after 400 days behind bars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He and his two Al Jazeera colleagues had been serving seven to 10-year sentences for aiding a terrorist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They were found to have produced false news in support of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood group, which was declared a terrorist organisation after Morsi was ousted by the Egyptian military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In January, Egypt's highest court threw out the verdicts and ordered the men face a retrial, citing procedural flaws in the initial case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Greste was deported before the retrial began on the orders of Morsi's successor Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Greste says he's anxious about Thursday's verdict because he has been unable to return to Egypt to mount a defence without violating Mr al-Sisi's order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He says a conviction on terrorism charges would have a devastating effect on his career as a foreign correspondent, restricting his ability to travel to countries possessing extradition arrangements with Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Greste's colleagues, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed are free on bail in Egypt awaiting the verdict, but reporting to police daily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Greste said he hoped the court would accept that there was a complete absence of evidence to support the charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If the court follows the evidence, we'll be fine," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But I'm still deeply concerned about the prospect of a conviction."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The first trial was condemned worldwide by human rights groups as politically motivated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The United Nations questioned Egypt's judicial independence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop this month told her Egyptian counterpart that Mr Greste must be cleared of all charges.</td></tr>
