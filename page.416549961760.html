<h3>Probe bribery claim: Bali Nine lawyer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The lawyer for Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan says claims the men face execution within hours because of a corrupt system must urgently be investigated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bribery claims around the death sentences of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan must be investigated urgently as the pair await their execution within days, their lawyer is arguing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Muhammad Rifan, the lawyer who represented the Bali Nine pair when they were sentenced to death in 2006, has told Fairfax Media judges asked for more than $130,000 for a lighter sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Rifan raised the claims months ago - without putting a sum on the bribe - and the men's current lawyer, Todung Mulya Lubis, has already lodged a complaint with the judicial commission, which appears to have stalled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Lubis says the commission has an obligation to finish its probe and it's not too late to stop the firing squad, which is set for Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We appeal to the attorney-general, we appeal to the president in the name of due process of law, in the name of fairness and justice, not to do the executions," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This is not an act of (a) desperado, this is a demand for justice."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Lubis says claims the men face execution because of a corrupt system must be urgently investigated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I know that we are counting the hours," Mr Lubis told reporters at Cilacap before visiting the Australians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I know that we've done everything possible under our legal systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"But Sukumaran and Chan still feel there's something wrong with all these legal proceedings, especially at the district court in Bali."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The pair also have a constitutional court challenge lodged, which would require clarity around the president's obligations on answering clemency requests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The case is set down for a preliminary hearing on May 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Amid the last minute pleas, the Chan and Sukumaran families took a boat from Cilacap to the island of Nusakambangan on Monday morning for some of their last hours with their loved ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They initially left the Cilicap port followed by Australia's consul-general to Bali, Majell Hind, and lawyer Julian McMahon after it was believed they were told the visitation rules had changed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They later returned to the port and were allowed passage to Nusakambangan, where the men will be executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says she's disappointed Indonesia ignored Australian government requests to delay the execution notices until after Anzac Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Despite the representations, Jakarta handed the pair their notices on Australia's "national day of remembrance", Ms Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Tony Abbott is due to meet French President Francois Hollande in Paris on Monday where they'll discuss the executions of 10 prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Hollande shares Australia's concerns about the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Frenchman Serge Atlaoui has been given a reprieve pending an appeals process, which followed strong diplomatic efforts by France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Police and military presence at the port was being beefed up on Monday, with barricades erected and surrounding roads sealed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Cilacap police station chief Ulung Sampurna Jaya said 1203 military and police personnel would be deployed from Monday to secure the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They were forming "rings", he said, around the firing ground, the airport on Nusakambangan and the port.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The preparations for execution have been running well, according to plan," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Security and order in Cilacap is also well controlled."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The officer would not comment on the time for the executions, saying it was outside his authority.</td></tr>
