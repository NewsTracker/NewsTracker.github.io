<h3>Boko Haram retakes NE town from Nigerian army</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Suspected Boko Haram insurgents have forced hundreds of soldiers to flee Marte, a border town along the shores of Lake Chad, a local official and witnesses said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The terrorists, numbering over 2,000, appeared from various directions on Thursday and engaged the soldiers in Kirenowa town and adjoining communities in Marte," said Imamu Habeeb, a local community leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"They fought with soldiers over the night and the fight continued today (Friday), forcing hundreds of soldiers to flee," he added from Borno state capital Maiduguri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Local fighter Shehu Dan Baiwa said the more than 2,000 fighters had been armed with bombs and tanks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"They used the weapons without restraint and succeeded in killing several people," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This is the third time Boko Haram has seized control of Marte in restive Borno state, a key battleground of their six-year insurgency, which has killed more than 13,000 and left 1.5 million homeless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The city is among several retaken in recent weeks by Nigeria's military, which has launched an offensive against the Islamists as part of a regional operation supported by Chad, Cameroon and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Boko Haram have been fighting back, and Nigerian troops were also forced to retreat from Boko Haram's Sambisa Forest stronghold this week after a landmine blast killed one soldier and three vigilantes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A senior local politician confirmed, on condition of anonymity, that the insurgents had retaken Marte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We lost many (people) because some of our people that fled to Chad and Cameroon have return after Nigerian troops recovered the town recently," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A senior military official confirmed the attack on Marte, but refused to say whether Boko Haram had retaken the town, describing the army's retreat as "strategic".</td></tr>
