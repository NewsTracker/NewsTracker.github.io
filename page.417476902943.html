<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Blatter said: "Fifa needs profound restructuring."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>US officials quoted in the New York Times said they hoped to gain the co-operation of some of the Fifa figures now under indictment on charges of racketeering and money laundering to try to build a case against Mr Blatter.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>It is primarily the American investigation that has plunged the world's governing body into the most serious crisis in its history.</td></tr>

<tr><td>22</td><td>"This would create unnecessary delay and I will urge the executive committee to organise an extraordinary congress for the election of my successor at the earliest opportunity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"This will need to be done in line with Fifa's statutes and we must allow enough time for the best candidates to present themselves and to campaign."</td></tr>
