<h3>Minute by minute, the demise of Germanwings flight that crashed in the Alps with 150 aboard</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 24-year-old A320 single-aisle jet arrives in Barcelona from Duesseldorf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Germanwings Flight 9525 takes off from Barcelona, slightly delayed because of airport congestion, for the return trip to Duesseldorf, about 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Aboard were 144 passengers, two pilots and four cabin staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Among them: babies, a group of German high-school students, an American contractor and her daughter, three generations of the same family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The pilots make their last contact with air traffic control in a routine message seeking and obtaining permission to continue course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>At the time, the aircraft had reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, and was over the Mediterranean Sea approaching the region around Marseille.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The plane begins its unexplained descent above the French coast, just as its flight path crosses over land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Air traffic controllers try to contact the pilots, but receive no response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The last radar position of the plane is registered, at 6,175 feet - only slightly higher than the peaks of the southern French Alps below.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The French Air Force sends a Mirage fighter jet to the plane's last known location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An air force official says the Mirage arrived too late to help, and never crossed paths with the A320.</td></tr>
