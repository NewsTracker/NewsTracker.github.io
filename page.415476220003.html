<h3>Gather Ye Rosebuds: 'Citizen Kane' Screened At Hearst Castle</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hearst hated the movie and did everything he could to stop it from being released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Citizen Kane has been called the best film ever made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was also at the center of an epic battle of egos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The main character was modeled after media titan William Randolph Hearst, who in real life tried ruthlessly to keep the movie from being released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hearst Castle, the estate of newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst, hosted its first-ever screening of Citizen Kane on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hearst hated the movie, and never allowed it to be shown there during his lifetime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Almost 75 years later, the family has called a truce, of sorts: This weekend, Citizen Kane was screened for the first time inside the millionaire's legendary home, the Hearst Castle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Back in 1941, the "boy wonder" Orson Welles was about to release his first feature film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>RKO Pictures had given the 26-year-old director the cinematic keys to the castle: complete creative control to make whatever movie he wanted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The movie was Citizen Kane, the story of power-hungry and tragic Charles Foster Kane and his castle on the hill, Xanadu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Everyone knew that Charles Foster Kane was a stand-in for William Randolph Hearst, and Xanadu for Hearst's Castle in San Simeon, on the California coast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It was a place that defined the word decadent: 165 rooms, a quarter-million acres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Hearst had entire 15th-century ceilings imported from Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He packed the mansion with art and turned part of the property into the world's largest private zoo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Wild zebras still roam the grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Above is the Doge's Suite, a guest room in the Hearst Castle inspired by the Doge's Palace in Venice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Hearst was America's first media mogul, dominating newspapers, magazines, newsreels and movies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>While he started his career on the left, by the 1930s Hearst had hired Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler as paid columnists, and he tried to destroy the New Deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He became a villain to a new generation of lefties, including Orson Welles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The castle living room, pictured in 1958, shortly before it opened to tourists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>When word got out that Welles had taken aim at Hearst, Hearst fired right back, first threatening an advertising blackout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Then, in an era long before TMZ, Hearst threatened worse than a blackout: bad publicity for the movie stars of RKO Pictures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"They said look, if you show this film, we are going to tell the life stories of lots of RKO people," says David Nasaw, author of The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"And we're going to take the same liberties when we tell those stories as Welles has taken with Hearst."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Yet after all of that, the studio still took the plunge and released Citizen Kane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It was a hit with critics, but bombed at the box office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The movie was most definitely not shown inside Hearst's lush, private theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A few years ago, however, Citizen Kane was played at the Hearst visitor center, down the hill from the castle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Then this year, Hearst's great-grandson Stephen, a vice president for the Hearst Corp., gave the thumbs-up to a screening in the mansion, for the San Luis Obispo Film Festival - raising eyebrows and questions among people who knew about the famous feud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"One of them hit me straight on," Stephen Hearst recalls, "and said, 'Do you think your great-grandfather would be rolling in his grave?' And I let him know that, based on my current responsibilities, I also have control of the mausoleum, and if necessary, I can check."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Hearst's descendants still get to use the castle, with its Roman pool and tennis courts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>They also have the name - still at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>6 on the Forbes list of America's most wealthy families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But the estate is now, of all things, a state park, and about 750,000 non-Hearsts come to ogle it every year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Not surprisingly, the mansion takes a lot of resources to maintain; the party's $1,000-a-pop tickets will help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>While he agrees the movie is a classic, Hearst biographer David Nasaw says that Charles Foster Kane and William Randolph Hearst shouldn't stay linked in the public imagination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"One of the reasons why Citizen Kane is dreadful biography and dreadful history is that it presents Hearst as a failure, as a bitter, nasty old man," Nasaw says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"Hearst had a great life. I mean he made lots and lots of enemies. But along the way, he had a grand time!"</td></tr>

<h3>Ex-IS hostage describes mock executions while held in Syria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Former hostage Javier Espinosa who had been held in Syria by Islamic State extremists has described mock executions and other forms of psychological torture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Espinosa wrote in the Sunday Times, Sunday March 15, 2015 that militant Mohammed Emwazi played a lead role in the mock executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Emwazi is the Londoner nicknamed Jihadi John who has played a central role in a series of beheading videos made in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>LONDON (AP) - A former hostage held in Syria by Islamic State extremists for more than six months has described mock executions and other forms of psychological torture against him and other captives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Spanish journalist Javier Espinosa wrote in The Sunday Times that militant Mohammed Emwazi played a lead role in the mock executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Emwazi, a Londoner nicknamed "Jihadi John," is believed to have played a central role in a series of beheading videos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Espinosa, who works for El Mundo and was on assignment for the Spanish daily when he was abducted in September 2013, characterized Emwazi as a bloodthirsty psychopath who enjoyed threatening him and other Western hostages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said Emwazi "caressed" his neck with a long blade and described how he would behead Espinosa: "'Feel it? Cold, isn't it? Can you imagine the pain you'll feel when it cuts? Unimaginable pain,'" he quoted Emwazi as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Emwazi went on to describe precisely how the beheading would occur, the former hostage said, and explained where he would place Espinosa's head once it had been done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Espinosa described how the militants took pleasure in telling their more than 20 hostages each day that they would be beheaded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said Emwazi used an antique sword for the mock executions and followed up by placing a Glock pistol against his head and pulling the trigger three times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Espinosa said he and the other hostages dubbed three English jihadis who were part of the Islamic Stage group "The Beatles" - even though the world-famous Liverpool band had four members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The nickname "Jihadi John" - which later caught on in the British press - is a reference to former Beatle John Lennon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Espinosa was released in March 2014 after being held captive for 194 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Most of the hostages were eventually released, but seven have died, including at least six who were killed, and one is known to still be a captive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Marc Marginedas, a second Spanish journalist who was freed at the same as Espinosa, gave his account in the Periodico de Catalunya newspaper in Spain Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said he had explained to his captors that he wasn't a spy and had entered Syria twice before to report and had been treated well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"'You entered Syria twice and it worked out well for you, but now we'll kill you,'" was the reply from his captor.</td></tr>
