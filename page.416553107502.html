<h3>Chaos at Kathmandu airport as Indians fight to leave Nepal after earthquake</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Chaos broke out this afternoon at an airport in Kathmandu as hundreds of Indian nationals fought to return home to safety following the devastating earthquake in Nepal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As rescue efforts continued throughout the Nepalese capital, more than 1,000 passengers joined a haphazard 1km-long queue outside the nearby airport in a desperate attempt to flee the stricken city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Despite plummeting temperatures and rain, crowds had started to form outside Tribhuwan International Airport as darkness fell on Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Even more passengers flocked to the airport this morning, including families huddled together beneath blankets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Many visitors had already booked return journeys but had crowded outside the airport in the hope of boarding the next available flight back to India.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Others had been left stranded after some flights out of the capital city were cancelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As the departure lounges grew busier, security guards were unable to control the sheer number of passengers vying for a coveted place in the queue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The airport's parking lot was converted into a makeshift waiting area to accommodate travellers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mohammad Pervez, one of the passengers outside the airport, told NDTV: 'There is no water here or food.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>The Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu had been briefly shut down yesterday due to a powerful aftershock from the 7.9 magnitude quake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>According to reports, the impact was so great that planes had to turn around mid-flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>India's budget SpiceJet said it was forced to recall its plane to New Delhi after the air traffic control centre at Kathmandu's airport was evacuated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Meanwhile, two Air India flights - carrying 135 and 45 passengers - were also turned back after the evacuation on the ground, according to the Press Trust of India news agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Indian Air Force evacuated several hundred stranded tourists but commercial flights were resumed just one hour later.</td></tr>
