<h3>Merkel wins Greek aid vote in parliament after chaos warning</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel prepares to vote during the session of Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, in Berlin on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BERLIN: German lawmakers cleared the way for talks on a third Greek bailout after Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that failing to try would be reckless and sow chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Merkel faced down her party bloc's biggest revolt over Greece yet and wielded her government majority in parliament's lower house to back the mandate on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Merkel's Christian Democrats and their Social Democratic coalition partner ensured passage with 439 votes in favour and 119 against, including 60 opponents in her Christian Democrat-led bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Forty lawmakers abstained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Five years after the debt crisis spread from Greece, Merkel renewed her argument for geopolitical stability and threw her standing behind persuading increasingly fed-up Germans that Europe's most-indebted nation still deserves aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chancellor Merkel speaks during debates prior to the vote to allow negotiations over the aid package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We are working to ensure that Greece remains a member of the euro because the euro is much more than a currency," Merkel told lawmakers in Berlin in a speech before the vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"A lot more is at stake" than Greece, she said, citing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and Europe's refugee crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Merkel said the advantages of an aid package of as much as 86 billion euros ($94 billion) outweigh the drawbacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A temporary Greek exit from the euro area is a less desirable option even if Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras wanted it, because it would lead to "predictable chaos," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We would be committing an act of recklessness if we didn't at least try" the path of bailout talks, Merkel said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Months of standoffs over aid and austerity between Tsipras and creditors have led to deposit flight and capital controls, pushing Greece to the brink.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Greek leader surrendered Monday to fresh demands for austerity and privatisation, opening the door to talks on a new bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who dangled the prospect of a Greek time-out from the euro, said Friday he still sees a way out of the crisis with the bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We must find a way that works, that functions, and that is very complicated," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"This is a last attempt to fulfil this extraordinarily difficult task."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>With the vote, lawmakers backed talks on aid from the European Stability Mechanism, the euro area's permanent firewall fund, and a loan to keep Greece afloat during talks on the proposed three-year bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>German lawmakers also have to vote on any deal that's negotiated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In a sign of growing exasperation with Greece, the number of dissenters in Merkel's bloc more than doubled from the 29 who voted against extending the second Greek bailout in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"If you have a bottomless barrel, you can pour as much water as you want into it -- it will never fill up," Christian Democrat Klaus-Peter Willsch, who voted against the government's line, said in a floor speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Gregor Gysi, floor leader of the anti-capitalist Left party, said Schaeuble is permanently damaging Germany's reputation and tearing down the objective of European unity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Mr. Schaeuble, I'm sorry, but you're destroying the idea of Europe," Gysi told lawmakers.</td></tr>
