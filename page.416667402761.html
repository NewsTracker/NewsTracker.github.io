<h3>Gunfire forces down army helicopter in western Mexico, 3 soldiers among 7 dead in violence</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>State police stand next to a charred passenger bus, that was extinguished by firefighters in Guadalajara, Mexico, Friday, May 1, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Authorities in western Mexico are asking residents to stay at home as they scramble to extinguish burning vehicles blocking roads in various parts of Guadalajara.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Such blockades are a common cartel response to the arrest of important members or are used to foil police and military operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>GUADALAJARA, Mexico - At least seven people died as flames and gunfire erupted around the western Mexico state of Jalisco on Friday when a military operation targeting a violent drug cartel was launched at the start of a three-day holiday weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Suspected cartel members stopped buses and trucks to block key highways in the state capital of Guadalajara and other cities, snarling traffic on a day Mexicans took to the road in droves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gunmen fired on a military helicopter, killing three soldiers and forcing it to make an emergency landing about 150 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Guadalajara.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ten soldiers and two federal police officers were injured and three soldiers remained missing, a defense ministry statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The statement said the helicopter was participating in the anti-cartel offensive known as Operation Jalisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jalisco Gov. Aristoteles Sandoval said at an afternoon news conference that the violence around the state was a reaction to the operation, which he said was designed to "get to the bottom of and to be able to arrest all the leaders of this cartel, of this organization."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sandoval did not name the cartel, but authorities have been locked in an increasingly bloody battle with the Jalisco New Generation cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Last month, cartel gunmen killed 15 state police officers in an ambush that was the bloodiest single attack on Mexican authorities in recent memory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>One week earlier, cartel gunmen attempted to assassinate the state security commissioner and on March 19 they killed five federal police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Authorities have said those attacks were revenge for state forces killing a cartel leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Friday, Sandoval said Operation Jalisco, which had been announced by federal authorities earlier in the day, had the goal of arresting all members of the cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Sandoval said there were a total of seven deaths Friday, but did not specify the circumstances or the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Later, state spokesman Gonzalo Sanchez said through his Twitter account that the dead included three soldiers, one state police officer, two suspected criminals and one civilian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The governor counted 29 road blockades around the state affecting 19 municipalities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He said 11 banks and five gas stations had been attacked and the state remained under a "code red" protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Fifteen people had been arrested and there were four armed confrontations, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>President Enrique Pena Nieto said through his Twitter account that he lamented the soldiers' deaths in the course of their work in Jalisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In December, Pena Nieto said Jalisco was considered one of the most unstable states in terms of security, along with Tamaulipas, Guerrero and Michoacan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He said then that those states would be prioritized in anti-crime efforts, but the violence there has continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Early in the day, the Jalisco state prosecutor's office used its Twitter account to ask residents of Guadalajara to remain calm as authorities responded to the road blockades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It said officials also were coordinating to extinguish fires and regain calm in other parts of the state's interior.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In recent weeks, burning vehicles and blockades in the state of Tamaulipas along the Texas border were attributed to factions of the Gulf cartel following the capture of some local leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But there have not been so many blockades erected simultaneously across so many parts of a state in recent memory.</td></tr>
