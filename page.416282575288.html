<h3>Secrecy shrouds decade-old oil spill in Gulf of Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO - The company responsible for a decade-old oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico has downplayed its size and shrouded its work in secrecy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But an Associated Press investigation has revealed evidence the Taylor Energy spill is far worse than what it - or the federal government - has publicly reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Presented with AP's findings, the Coast Guard provided a new leak estimate about 20 times greater than one the company recently touted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Outside experts say the spill could be one of the largest ever in the Gulf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Taylor Energy has spent tens of millions of dollars to contain and stop its leak but says nothing can be done to completely halt the sheens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company has presented federal regulators with a proposed "final resolution," but details remain under wraps.</td></tr>
