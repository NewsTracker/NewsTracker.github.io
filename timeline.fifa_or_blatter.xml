    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the focus once more on football, the embattled FIFA leadership and much-criticized host nation Russia could display a confident and united front during a slickly staged show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Blatter's first major public event since American and Swiss criminal investigations of corruption in world football were unsealed two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thank you President Putin, you make us happy and comfortable," said Blatter, making his first trip outside his native Switzerland since mid-May. He has avoided FIFA business in countries which have extradition treaties with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin and Blatter got a standing ovation from Russian and football officials and guests when they walked on together in a temporary venue built in the splendid grounds of Konstantin Palace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blatter has long defended Russia against criticism, and earlier Saturday confirmed his backing at a brief photo call with Putin inside the former Romanov palace.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
