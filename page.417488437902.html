<h3>Sepp Blatter back at work at FIFA headquarters</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this Friday, May 29, 2015 file photo, FIFA president Sepp Blatter after his election as President greeted by UEFA President Michel Platini, right, at the Hallenstadion in Zurich, Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Blatter has been re-elected as FIFA president for a fifth term, chosen to lead world soccer despite separate U.S. and Swiss criminal investigations into corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 209 FIFA member federations gave the 79-year-old Blatter another four-year term on Friday after Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan conceded defeat after losing 133-73 in the first round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A day after announcing his decision to resign, Sepp Blatter was back at work at FIFA headquarters on Wednesday as the worst corruption crisis in the governing body's 111-year history continued to unfold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Interpol added six men with ties to FIFA to its most wanted list, while South African officials denied they made a $10 million bribe to secure the 2010 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Blatter spoke to FIFA staff for about 10 minutes on Wednesday morning, returning to the same auditorium where he delivered his resignation speech a day earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Staff described him as being emotional, and said he received a standing ovation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Elsewhere, Interpol got involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The international police force, based in Lyon, France, issued an alert for two former FIFA officials and four executives on charges including racketeering and corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Two of the men, former FIFA vice president Jack Warner of Trinidad and Tobago and former executive committee member Nicolas Leoz of Paraguay, have been arrested in their home counties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Warner has since been released and Leoz is under house arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Interpol "red notice" means they risk arrest anywhere they travel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In South Africa, Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula said the government wanted to "categorically deny" that the country paid any bribes to win the right to host the 2010 tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mbalula characterized the $10 million as an "above-board payment" to help soccer development in the Caribbean region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The money, which went into a fund controlled by Warner, is part of the U.S. investigation into soccer corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That probe led to the arrest of seven soccer officials in Zurich last week, kicking off the FIFA scandal and eventually leading to Blatter's decision to step down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Warner and Leoz were among 14 people indicted in the U.S. as part of the federal investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, speaking in Latvia on Wednesday at a meeting with EU justice ministers, declined to comment on Blatter's resignation or whether he was himself under investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"It's an open case and so we will now be speaking through the courts," Lynch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In a separate probe, Swiss authorities have opened a criminal investigation related to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding contests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Russia won the right to host the 2018 tournament and Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Swiss attorney general's office said Blatter was not under investigation, but said it has opened criminal proceedings against "persons unknown" for money-laundering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Blatter said Tuesday he would remain president until a new election can be set up, which FIFA said could be sometime between December and March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein, who lost to Blatter in Friday's election, left open the possibility that he could stand again, and former FIFA vice president Chung Mong-joon said at a news conference in Seoul that he will think about whether to run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>UEFA president Michel Platini is considered a likely candidate.</td></tr>
