<h3>Boko Haram leader vows to disrupt Nigeria elections</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has vowed to disrupt Nigeria's general election in a new video released on social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The release of the video came after the Islamist militant group was blamed for two suicide attacks which killed 38 people in the country's north-east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"This election will not be held even if we are dead," Shekau said in the video released on Tuesday, presumably referring to the poll scheduled for March 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Even if we are not alive Allah will never allow you to do it," he said in the Hausa language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The video appeared to be the first message released by the group on Twitter, a sign of its changing media tactics after previous messages were distributed to journalists on DVD.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Shekau was shown in unusual clarity in front of a solid blue background, dressed in black and with an automatic weapon resting to his right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nigeria's general election had been scheduled for February 14 but has been postponed by six weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Security services say they need more time to contain the violence in the north-east, Boko Haram's stronghold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Despite Shekau's threat, experts have said they doubt the Islamist rebels have the capacity to disrupt voting nationwide, although election officials have conceded that voting could prove impossible in parts of the north-east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In the video Shekau also claimed responsibility for a weekend attack in the north-east Nigerian city of Gombe, which the military said was repelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He disputed the military's account of the clashes and claimed that his fighters overran troops and freed insurgents from prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Islamist leader has been declared a global terrorist by the United States, a label sanctioned by the United Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The US military will share communications equipment and intelligence with African allies to assist them in the fight against Boko Haram, the commander of US Special Forces operations in Africa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>West African military commanders have long complained that cross-border operations against Islamist groups - from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in Mali to Boko Haram in Nigeria - have been obstructed by a lack of compatible communications equipment, which makes it hard to swap information and coordinate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Photo: The Chadian army patrols the border between Nigeria and Cameroon in January, as part of a military contingent against Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Major General James Linder said that, as part of the annual US-sponsored "Flintlock" counter-terrorism exercises this year in Chad, the US would introduce technology to allow African partners to communicate between mobile phones, radios and computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The RIOS system would allow soldiers in the field to transmit photos from a remote location in the Sahel immediately to a central command room and could also precisely pin-point the coordinates of personnel, a US military official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Brigadier General Zakaria Ngobongue, the Chadian director of the Flintlock exercises, welcomed the US assistance in improving communications between regional armies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We need support in terms of intelligence and logistics, above all in communication because the equipment we have comes from different countries, and their support will make our task much easier," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Washington's long-term goal was to enable African nations to be sufficiently trained and equipped to face their own security challenges, Mr Linder said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"By 2050, one-third of the global population will be on the African continent," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The global economy and the global community need stable countries in Africa and that can only happen through African nation states themselves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Amid growing international alarm, the four nations of the Lake Chad region - Chad, Niger, Cameroon and Nigeria - plus neighbouring Benin have been preparing a joint task-force of 8,700 men to take on Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Sunni jihadist group has killed an estimated 10,000 people last year in its campaign to carve an Islamist emirate from northern Nigeria.</td></tr>
