<h3>Greek parliament backs setting up committee to investigate bailout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek lawmakers voted on Tuesday in favor of setting up a committee to examine the circumstances under which Greece agreed to bailouts totaling 240 billion euros ($260 billion) with the European Union and International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Relations are tense between Athens and its creditors, on whom it depends for money to stay afloat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece, which has not received any bailout funds since last August, is fast running out of cash and struggling to strike a deal on reforms needed to unblock that aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"After five years of parliamentary silence on the major issues that caused the bailout catastrophe, today we commence a procedure that will give answers to the questions concerning the Greek people," Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told lawmakers before the vote in the early hours of Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The committee, proposed by Tsipras's leftist Syriza party and its coalition partner, the right-wing Independent Greeks, will look into how Greece entered the agreements and any other issue relating to the bailouts and their implementation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This includes the revision of the 2009 budget deficit, whose wildly gyrating figures triggered the country's fiscal crisis, a debt restructuring in 2012 and the recapitalisation of the country's banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The proposal was approved with 156 of the 250 lawmakers present voting in favor, 72 against and 22 abstaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Former prime minister Antonis Samaras, now the main opposition leader, accused Tsipras of trying to distract the public from the pressing issues facing the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Indeed we will need a new committee... (to examine) the credit event (crunch) which you are bringing closer... and for the new bailout you are leading us toward," Samaras said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A fierce critic of Greece's bailouts and the unpopular austerity attached to them, Tsipras had made setting up such a committee one of his pre-election pledges and has repeatedly promised to scrap measures such as wage and pension cuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Greeks have been hit hard by austerity imposed on them under the bailout agreements over the last five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greece is only just emerging from years of economic depression and roughly one in four Greeks is still unemployed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In March, parliament passed an anti-poverty bill offering food stamps and free electricity to the poor to tackle what Tsipras calls the country's humanitarian crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The bailout committee follows a parliamentary panel set up to audit ballooning debt and another to demand reparations for the Nazi occupation, a claim which has strained relations between Greece and its biggest creditor, Germany.</td></tr>
