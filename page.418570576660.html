<h3>The Latest: Dutch PM's party reserves judgment on Greek deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's Liberal Party is reserving judgment on the bailout deal intended to save Greece from bankruptcy and a messy exit from the euro single currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Rutte conceded after the deal was struck in Brussels Monday that if implemented, any bailout will mean he will have broken an electoral promise to send no more money to Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mark Harbers of the Liberal Party deflected criticism of the broken pledge by telling lawmakers in a debate Thursday that he can only give an opinion on the deal once all details have been pinned down by eurozone negotiators and Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Dutch parliament does not have to vote to approve the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Junior Dutch coalition partner the Labor Party welcomed the agreement as a key show of solidarity in a Europe beset by crises at its borders.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>ECB President Mario Draghi will chair Thursday's news conference after the bank decided to leave its main interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.05 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As well as commenting on the broad economic situation, Draghi will likely be quizzed over when the ECB will increase emergency credit to Greek banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It capped the amount on offer over two weeks ago, a move that forced Greek banks to close as they were unable to meet demands for withdrawals by fearful depositors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The ECB says it can only lend to banks that are solvent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>So it first needs a clear prospect of a bailout deal for Greece to restore the finances of the government and banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The European Union is hailing the austerity package adopted by Greek lawmakers as a significant step toward rebuilding trust and fulfilling preconditions for a new financial bailout of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>EU Commission spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt said in Brussels that the Greek parliament "has spoken with a very loud voice."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Greek lawmakers backed the package by 229 votes to 64.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Breidthardt said experts from the Commission, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank have come to a unanimous agreement that the Greeks had "legally implemented the first set of four measures agreed at the euro summit" on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Greece's 18 eurozone partners agreed to provide it with around 85 billion euros ($93 billion) in financial assistance, but only if the Greek government committed itself in advance to a raft of measures and reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Finland has given its backing to the start of Greek bailout negotiations and for a short-term loan to be sorted out for the financially strapped country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Finnish Finance Minister Alexander Stubb said a committee of Finnish lawmakers has backed both, hours after the Greek Parliament approved an austerity package demanded by creditors in return for a bailout from Europe's bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Stubb said in a tweet that the so-called Grand Committee has given the government "a mandate for bridge financing and beginning of ESM-negotiations on Greece."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Finland has taken a hard line over Greece in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Credit ratings agency Moody's says Greece's approval of austerity measures "averts an immediate disorderly default and potential exit from the euro" but warns that "risks remain elevated" given substantial skepticism within the country on the bailout conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Greek parliament's approval of the economic measures paves the way for eurozone finance ministers to open talks on a third rescue package for the country worth some 85 billion euros over three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Moody's notes, however, that "judging by recent events and the deep economic problems and social divisions within society, it is highly uncertain whether the Greek authorities have the capacity to achieve agreed objectives and to abide by its creditor's conditions."</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>Greece wants to tap the European Stability Mechanism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>To use the fund, officials must establish the existence of a risk to the financial stability of the entire eurozone, which many question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>ESM chief Klaus Regling told Germany's ARD television Thursday that failure to reach a final agreement would mean the collapse of Greece's banking system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He said the four biggest Greek banks are "system-relevant," code for significant to the international financial system, and that if they fail that would have "severe effects not just for Greece itself ... but for the eurozone as a whole."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Germany's finance minister says the eurozone must keep to its rules as it negotiates a new bailout with Greece, which Berlin says rules out an outright debt cut for Athens in the eurozone.</td></tr>

<tr><td>35</td><td>Schaeuble has taken a hardline approach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Last weekend, a paper from his ministry suggesting the possibility of a voluntary, temporary Greek euro exit emerged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The minister said Thursday "it would perhaps be a better way for Greece, and many say that - increasingly in Greece too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Germany's finance minister says the Greek Parliament's approval of an austerity package is "an important step" but is warning that talks on a final bailout deal will be tough - and that an outright debt cut would be incompatible with Greece keeping the euro.</td></tr>
