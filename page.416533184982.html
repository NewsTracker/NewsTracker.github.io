<tr><td>39</td><td>Police acknowledged Friday that Gray, 25, should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested - before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the Police Department's policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Gray, who is black, was arrested after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>50</td><td>"I'm here to do what I can. Police brutality is as old as the 1950s, 1960s. It's still here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Wearing a sign around his neck that said "I am Freddie Gray," 33-year-old Dante Acree joined thousands of others outside City Hall.</td></tr>
