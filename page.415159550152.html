<h3>Cleveland mayor apologizes for city response to Tamir Rice lawsuit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The language used in the city's response to a lawsuit brought by the family of Tamir Rice was "very insensitive" and an amended court document will be filed within 20 days that preserves the city's rights, Jackson told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The court filing asserted as a defense for the city that Rice's "injuries, losses, and damages complained of, were directly and proximately caused by the failure of plaintiffs' decedent to exercise due care to avoid injury."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jackson said he was apologizing to Rice's family and to the city's residents for what he said was a poor choice of words in the city's response filed on Friday to the family's lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"In an attempt to protect all of our defenses, we used words and we phrased things in such a way that was very insensitive to the tragedy in general, the family and the victim in particular," Jackson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An attorney for the Rice family, Benjamin Crump, on Monday criticized the city's response to the federal lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I don't want him just to apologize for the poor word use," Crump said on CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I want him to apologize for the death of this 12-year-old child."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Rice's shooting came at a time of heightened scrutiny over the use of force by police around the United States, including Cleveland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Rice was holding a replica handgun that mainly shoots plastic pellets when he was shot by a Cleveland officer within seconds after police responded to a report of a suspect brandishing a handgun in a city park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He died the next day.</td></tr>
