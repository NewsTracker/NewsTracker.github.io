<h3>Wisconsin Assembly labor committee takes up right-to-work bill in expected 10-hour hearing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- Electricians, pipe fitters, carpenters and other union members opposed to making Wisconsin the 25th right-to-work state dominated more than 11 hours of testimony Monday on a fast-tracked proposal expected to pass the Legislature later in the week and be signed into law by Gov. Scott Walker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Assembly Labor Committee, six days after the Senate Labor Committee held a similar hearing, heard testimony into the night on the bill that would ban any requirement that nonunion members in the private sector pay union dues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Opponents outnumbered supporters 70-1 at last week's Senate hearing, and the majority of those speaking Monday were also against the measure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The committee only took testimony and did not plan a vote on the measure, which was identical to what the full Senate passed last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Democrats called on the committee to make changes, but Republican committee chairman Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Andre Jacque, R-DePere, said that would only delay the process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Democrats can offer amendments when the measure is up before the full Republican-controlled Assembly, likely on Thursday, but none are expected to be adopted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Unlike in the Senate, where the committee was cut short before hundreds of people were able to testify, everyone who had registered to speak Monday and was present was able to say their piece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Union members and other opponents reiterated their arguments that the measure would weaken unions, leading to lower wages and unsafe workplaces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They also questioned who really wanted the law, given that coalitions representing hundreds of contractors and other businesses had formed in opposition, and said it was wrong to rush the bill through in less than two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Supporters, including the state chamber of commerce, said they represented many other people who were reluctant to speak publicly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Backers argue that the change will make Wisconsin more competitive with other states, in particular Indiana and Michigan, and allow workers the freedom to decide whether they want to pay union dues rather than have them deducted automatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Scott Manley, a lobbyist for Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, said businesses are pushing for the bill because it will send a message that the state has a more favorable climate for development.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kristi LaCroix, a former teacher from Kenosha, testified in favor of the measure saying workers should have the option to pay dues, rather than being required to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>John Drew, a United Auto Workers representative from Milwaukee, said approving the bill would allow non-union employees to become freeloaders, as they would receive union benefits without paying dues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's like saying if you don't like the Republicans controlling Wisconsin, you shouldn't have to pay taxes," Drew said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Randy Bryce, a former Democratic state Senate candidate and member of the Ironworkers Local 8 union who was removed from the Senate gallery last week for yelling during debate, called the bill a "blatant political attack" and government intrusion into private business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Madison bankruptcy attorney James Murray sarcastically testified in favor of the bill, saying it would "send a clear message that Wisconsin is open for bankruptcy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The full Assembly, which is controlled by Republicans 63-36, was expected to debate the measure Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The bill passed the Senate on a 17-15 vote last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Walker, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, has said he will sign it into law by the end of the week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The bill would take effect immediately.</td></tr>

<h3>Twitter, law enforcement investigate alleged Islamic State threats</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Islamic State supporters, in online posts on Sunday, called for attacks against Twitter and its "interests," including death threats, according to the online news media company Buzzfeed as well as the NBC news network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Our security team is investigating the veracity of these threats with relevant law enforcement officials," a representative for Twitter said in a statement on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Buzzfeed first reported the story on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One alleged threat was directed to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, NBC reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Dorsey didn't address or acknowledge the threats in his latest tweets on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The messages were posted on an anonymous file-sharing website called Pastebin, according to the media reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Your virtual war on us will cause a real war on you," one post by Islamic State supporters said, according to Buzzfeed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We told you from the beginning it's not your war, but you didn't get it and kept closing our accounts on Twitter, but we always come back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Islamic State militants have relied heavily on Twitter and other social media networks to coordinate and to communicate, including the publishing of shocking videos of beheadings and other violent acts against its enemies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But social media companies, including Twitter, have also removed content and suspended accounts that post gruesome content, such as executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Twitter's user policy prohibits the use of the service for violence and threats, stating on its website: "You may not publish or post direct, specific threats of violence against others."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The company does not, however, "proactively monitor content," a representative for the network told Reuters last week, adding that such policies were in place for other similar companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Twitter's platform, which allows people to post 140-character messages with pictures and brief video clips, has more than 288 million users across the world, the company says.</td></tr>
