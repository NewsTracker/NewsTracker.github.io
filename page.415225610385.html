<h3>Egypt's el-Sissi replaces interior minister in reshuffle</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It said Interior Minister Mohammed Ibrahim, who is in charge of police, was replaced by another police general, Magdy Abdel-Ghafar, a career officer in the feared State Security Agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ibrahim's removal followed an uptick in bomb attacks blamed on Islamic militants targeting the heart of the heavily protected Egyptian capital, Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On Wednesday, a massive fire destroyed most of the city's showcase convention center in an eastern suburb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>No foul play was suspected, but the fire was interpreted by the president as Ibrahim's latest failure, according to Egyptian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's the first Cabinet reshuffle since el-Sissi, a solider-turned-politician, took office in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He led the military ouster of the Islamist Mohammed Morsi, the nation's first freely elected leader, about a year before taking office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>El-Sissi also replaced the ministers of culture, tourism, education, housing and telecommunications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He also introduced a new Cabinet portfolio, a minister for vocational training.</td></tr>
