<h3>Records show thousands of Baltimore arrestees too injured to enter jail, report says - 4 arrested in murders of Miss. police officers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Thousands of people arrested by Baltimore police over the past three years have been turned away from the city's jail because their injuries are too severe, according to a new report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Baltimore Sun, citing records dating back to June 2012, reported Sunday that corrections officers refused to admit over 2,600 detainees to the state-run Baltimore City Detention Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The records showed that 123 of the detainees who weren't admitted to jail had visible head injuries, the third-most common ailment cited by jail officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Others had broken bones, facial trauma and high blood pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The records do not indicate how the people were injured or whether they suffered their injuries while in custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However, they do suggest that police officers either ignored or did not notice the injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Suspects are constitutionally guaranteed health care before they are booked into jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Police did not comment to The Sun, and department spokespeople did not immediately return messages left by The Associated Press on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The report comes as the city's police department is under intense scrutiny for their treatment of detainees following the death of Freddie Gray last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gray died of a broken neck that prosecutors said he suffered while riding in a Baltimore police van, and six officers involved in Gray's arrest are facing criminal charges, including one charged with second-degree murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Gray's death sparked rioting and widespread protests in the city and came amid national controversy over how police officers treat suspects, particularly black men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Friday, the Justice Department announced that it is conducting a civil-rights investigation of Baltimore police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Critics of the police tell the Sun that the figures indicate that Baltimore police officers don't care about the condition of detainees after they are arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Others, including criminologists and law enforcement experts, say that officers are not adequately trained to detect injuries or whether a detainee is faking being hurt in an effort to avoid jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In the Gray case, prosecutors claimed that Gray requested medical care five times before his death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Sun has previously reported that dozens of Baltimore residents have accused the city's police of inflicting injuries on them and disregarding their requests for medical help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The paper reported in September 2014 that the city has paid out almost $6 million in court judgments and settlements in response to over 100 lawsuits filed since 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</td></tr>
