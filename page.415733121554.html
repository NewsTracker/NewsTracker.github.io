<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Tunisian town that inspired the name of Luke Skywalker's home planet has become the focal point of that country's fight against ISIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Reported jihadist activity in several Tunisian locations, including Tataouine, the remote community whose name George Lucas used for the desert planet Tatooine, has also prompted warnings from the U.S. and British governments for tourists to stay away, CNN reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Star Wars" fans have been known to visit sites in Tunisia that have become settings for several of the "Star Wars" films.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>Tataouine itself wasn't used as a location in any of the "Star Wars" films, but it's near other sites that served as the quarters in "Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace," including the home of young Anakin Skywalker and his mother, Shmi, according to StarWars.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Last week, terrorists attacked the National Bardo Museum in the nation's capital of Tunis, killing 23 and leaving many others wounded.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>Tunisians say their democracy is young and vulnerable, and their country is at a crossroads in trying to fend off the jihadist "contagion" that is sweeping across North Africa, CNN reported.</td></tr>
