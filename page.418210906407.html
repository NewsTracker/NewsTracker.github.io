<h3>Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails reveal fax machine confusion</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton needed to get her fax straight when she was secretary of state, newly released emails show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Clinton had a 15-minute exchange with top aide Huma Abedin about how to use the fax machine in late December 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Can you hang up the fax line?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Abedin wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"They will call again and try fax."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I thought it was supposed to be off hook to work?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton responded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Yes, but hang up one more time. So they can establish the line," Abedin replied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I did," said Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Just pick up phone and hang it up. And leave it hung up," Abedin answered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I've done it twice now," grumbled the secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Just weeks earlier Clinton seemed to realize she could use some tech training, asking top aide Cheryl Mills if she could borrow a book called "SEND: Why People Email so Badly and How to Do it Better."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She also expressed concern on a few occasions that she wasn't hanging out enough with President Obama - noting that former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had daily meetings with President Richard Nixon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"In thinking about the Kissinger interview, the only issue I think that might be raised is that I see POTUS at least once a week while K saw Nixon everyday. Of course, if I were dealing w that POTUS I'd probably camp in his office to prevent him from doing something problematic. Do you see this as a problem?" she wrote one aide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>At another point, Clinton heard on the radio that there was a cabinet meeting with Obama, and asked her staff "Can I go?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It turns out that the meeting was just for junior staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A few days later, after showing up for a meeting with Obama at the White House that had been canceled, she seemed to grow irritated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"This is the second time this has happened," she emailed staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"What's up???"</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>These emails - and most of the 3,000 pages of emails released Tuesday night by the State Department - highlight the occasional banality of the high-flying job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She did get to hang out with some intriguing-sounding people, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Clinton repeatedly refers to someone named Santa in her emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I'm seeing Santa at 8:30 so won't take off until closer to 9:30," she emailed Abedin in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Republicans have been digging through Clinton's emails hoping to find some malfeasance or evidence that she made mistakes in Benghazi, Libya, beyond what is already public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>And while the emails do contain evidence that some Obama administration officials had her personal email, raising questions about who knew she was avoiding use of an official email account, so far they haven't exposed much new information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Despite her earlier missteps with technology, Clinton eventually got a handle on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In an email to an aide, she wrote: "Pls call Sarah and ask her if she can get me some iced tea."</td></tr>
