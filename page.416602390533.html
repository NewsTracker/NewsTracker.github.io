<h3>Border Control discover TWO sophisticated underground tunnels from California to Mexico and stop a $700K shipment of methamphetamine entering the US</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. Border Patrol agents say they have seized two sophisticated tunneling systems stretching beneath the U.S.-Mexico border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The first tunnel was discovered Monday in Calexico, southern California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The secret passageway measured a total of 230 feet - 70 meters - and burrowed into Mexicali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was about four feet high and four feet wide and was fitted with a complex lighting and ventilation system, UT San Diego reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Seized: Agents came across the tunnel after intercepting a major shipment of methamphetamine nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The entrance of the tunnel was inside a residence in Mexicali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It was discovered by members of the patrol's Border Search Trauma and Rescue unit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The discovery was precipitated by the seizure of 25 vacuum-sealed packages containing 69 pounds of methamphetamine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A group of men were caught with the haul - worth $694,000 - trying to cross the All-American Canal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Three of the men fled back to Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Then on Tuesday an incomplete tunnel was found on the Tijuana-San Diego border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The tunnel was under construction, but had a rail system with a cart, as well as lighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It was tall enough to walk through but had no drugs or contraband inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The entrance was within a home in Tijuana, but the US exit had not been dug out yet, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The residence is apparently located near the U.S. border fence in Colonia Castillo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>U.S. federal authorities have found more than 80 cross-border smuggling tunnels since 2006, according to UT San Diego.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Most of the systems are in California and Arizona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Drugs are the primary reason for the tunnels.</td></tr>
