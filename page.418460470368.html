<h3>Ramirez, Betts help Red Sox beat Yankees 5-3 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox rookie Eduardo Rodriguez didn't waste any time worrying about whether he was pitching to save his team's season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was facing the New York Yankees for the first time, and that was plenty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''I don't know how big it was for them, but for me it was pretty big,'' the 22-year-old left-hander said after helping Boston beat New York 5-3 on Saturday night to cut the team's deficit in the AL East to 5 1/2 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''It was the first time I faced the Yankees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hanley Ramirez hit a two-run homer, Mookie Betts had a pair of extra-base hits and David Ortiz also had two hits to help the Red Sox rebound a day after losing the series opener and top pitcher Clay Buchholz in the same game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That dropped Boston to 6 1/2 games behind the Yankees in the AL East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And instead of hoping for a sweep that would propel them into the playoff chase, they were looking at dropping further back in the division and perhaps out of the race entirely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Yankees had beaten Boston five straight times, including a 5-1 win Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the Red Sox got 6 1-3 solid innings from Rodriguez (5-2) to win for the 10th time in 13 games and cut the 10-game deficit they faced on June 20 nearly in half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Rodriguez allowed five hits and a walk while striking out two, leaving with a 3-2 lead in the seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He allowed solo homers to Alex Rodriguez and Jacoby Ellsbury - just the third time in nine career starts that he has given up two runs or more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''He didn't fear the strike zone after getting a couple of balls squared up,'' Farrell said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Koji Uehara pitched the ninth for his 22nd save, ending it by getting Brian McCann on a 400-foot fly ball to center with a man on base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Yankees manager Joe Girardi thought it looked good off the bat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''Then I saw it drift toward center,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Alex Rodriguez homered in the first inning for the second straight game, and Ellsbury had three hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Boston tied it 1-1 in the third, then Ortiz singled to lead off the fourth and Ramirez homered to make it 3-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ellsbury homered into the Boston bullpen to cut the lead to 3-2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Red Sox added two in the seventh, chasing Ivan Nova, when Betts hit an RBI triple and then scored on Xander Bogaerts' infield single.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Nova (1-3) allowed four runs on eight hits, striking out three in 6 2-3 innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Alex Rodriguez made it 1-0 with his 672nd career homer, hitting it over the Green Monster, where it was grabbed by a fan in a ''Free (Tom) Brady'' T-shirt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Yankees designated hitter was booed by the crowd, but he found a fan in a Yankees jersey in the front row to hand his batting gloves to on the way to the dugout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Yankees prospect Rob Refsnyder was hitless in three at-bats, batting ninth in his major-league debut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Refsnyder, who was called up from Triple-A, hit into a double play in the third and was robbed of his first hit in the sixth when Boston RF Alejandro De Aza came in to make a diving catch of his sinking liner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He popped to first in the eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''I wasn't nervous at all,'' he joked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''It was quite an experience, growing up a sports fan in a sports family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It was special.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>I would have liked to get a hit and help the team win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Yankees: Nathan Eovaldi (8-2) pitches for the Yankees in the series finale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Red Sox: Wade Miley (8-7) will try to help Boston win its fifth straight series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Yankees: The Yankees moved OF Mason Williams from the 15-day to the 60-day disabled list to make room for Rob Refsnyder on the 40-man roster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Red Sox: Buchholz was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right elbow a day after leaving his start in the fourth inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>To take his place, the club selected LHP Brian Johnson from Triple-A Pawtucket.</td></tr>
