<h3>5 Things to know about Clinton's decision to run again</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>While the Democratic political apparatus had been pushing Clinton to run since the day she left the State Department, she waited until last fall to fully engage in the process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Once she did, Clinton met with dozens of policy and political experts, pored through countless memos and delved deeply into what went wrong with her failed 2008 campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>As Clinton was returning to private life after her four years in the Obama administration, an outside group called Ready for Hillary was pushing her to run for the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At first, the group was a source of frustration for her advisers, who dismissed it as a JV operation that was putting too much pressure on Clinton far too quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But soon, the Clinton team's view of Ready for Hillary would shift from annoyance to acceptance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The energy the organization was harnessing reminded them of the kind of grassroots movements they jealously watched mobilize around Barack Obama in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There was plenty that gave Clinton pause as she started weighing another campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She grimaced at the thought of giving up her privacy again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She worried about putting daughter Chelsea, her husband Marc and their baby in the spotlight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She felt bad that her candidacy would crowd out Vice President Joe Biden, a longtime friend who was also considering a White House run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Clinton was also mindful of chatter that she could be challenged from her party's liberal left flank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She set up a meeting with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose anti-Wall Street positions were galvanizing progressives and stoking talk that she could launch her own 2016 campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The meeting was as much an opportunity for Clinton to gauge the mood of progressives as it was a chance to size up the seriousness of Warren's repeated denials of a White House run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Clinton campaigned aggressively for Democrats in the midterm elections, holding 45 events for 26 candidates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>More than half of those candidates lost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Clinton had expected the results to be bad, but not this bad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Democrats had run scared, she concluded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The party had done little to defend its accomplishments on the economy and health care, and done even less to argue what Democrats wanted to do in the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Clinton's takeaways about Democrats' failures would guide the final months of her decision-making about running for president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Though the fall, Clinton delved into meetings with political and policy experts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>As she navigated what a successful campaign would look like, she consulted several operatives who worked for Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Among them: former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, ground game guru Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, and digital director Teddy Goff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Clinton also convened long economic discussions that centered on income inequality and the widening achievement gap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Foreign policy experts gave her their diagnosis of pressing problems in the Middle East and with Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Clinton took hand-written notes and stockpiled multi-page memos.</td></tr>
