<h3>Apple's first experiment with a watch was an iPhone with a velcro strap: Firm reveals how the project started - as analysts predict it will a MILLION in first weekend</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple has revealed how its hi-tech watch started from humble beginnings - an iPhone strapped to a designer's wrist with velcro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The $349 apple Watch is set to go on sale on April 24th - with customers able to visit an Apple store to try one on from April 10th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Analysts say they expect the gadget to be a huge success - with one predicting the product could sell one million in its first weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The $349 Apple Watch is set to go on sale on April 24th - with customers able to visit an Apple store to try one on fro April 10th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>HOW MANY WILL APPLE SELL?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According Piper Jaffray senior analyst Gene Munster, Apple will sell a million watches in its first weekend on sale, three times the first-day sales of Apple's last all-new product, the iPad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It would put the Apple Watch behind Apple's first iPad, which sold 3 million in its first weekend in 2010, but ahead of the first iPhone, which sold 700,000 units when it debuted in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, it would be a fraction of the 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Pluses sold in the same timespan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In a rare interview, the head of the watch project and one of its designers have revealed how the gadget came to life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, the firm admits it didn't use any old velcro, and it was 'a very nicely designed Velcro strap,' according to Kevin Lynch, who heads up the project at Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He admitted to Wired that when he took the job, secrecy around the watch was so tight even he had no idea what he'd be doing when he moved from Adobe in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The firm initially used the velcro strap, and then designed a custom dongle, an actual watch crown that plugged into the bottom of the phone through the cord jack, to work on their interface ideas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Lynch says the key to the Apple watch is its ability to be unobtrusive - and to stop people constantly looking at their phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'We're so connected, kind of ever-presently, with technology now,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Apple's design team believed that technology becoming wearable was inevitable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'There was a sense that technology was going to move onto the body,' says Alan Dye, who runs Apple's human interface group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>According to Wired, Apple's Sir Jonathan Ive began thinking about about an Apple watch just after CEO Steve Jobs' death in October 2011, and brought the idea to Dye and a small group of others in the design studio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>According to analysts, the hard work will pay off with at least a million units sold in the first weekend, according to Piper Jaffray senior analyst Gene Munster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Kevin Lynch of Apple, who admitted secrecy around the watch was so tight even he had no idea what he'd be doing when he moved to head up the project from Adobe in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>That's three times the first-day haul of Apple's last all-new product, the iPad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The estimate is based on an attach rate of nearly half a percent of total iPhone users, Munster said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In unit terms, that would put the Apple Watch behind Apple's first iPad, which sold 3 million in its first weekend in 2010, but ahead of the first iPhone, which sold 700,000 units when it debuted in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>However, it's a fraction of the 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Pluses sold in the same timespan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Some investment firms such as JPMorgan Chase, which peg the smartwatch's first-year sales closer to 26 million units and Credit Suisse, which estimates sales as high as 35 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Last month it emerged Apple has been operating a secret health lab for two years to perfect to perfect the Apple Watch's fitness tracking capabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The gym-like lab is used for gathering fitness data and testing tracking features.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>ABC News was given access to Apple's hidden facility, revealing it is full of Apple employees wearing complex fitness monitoring masks and even have special hot and cold rooms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>ABC News was given access to Apple's hidden facility in Cupertino, revealing it is full of Apple employees wearing complex fitness monitoring masks and even has special hot and cold rooms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Employees can volunteer to participate in tests, which Apple started conducting two years ago, though it didn't reveal to employees the reasons why they were being tested until recently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>They are shown running on treadmills, rowing, doing yoga, and wearing masks to measure their breathing changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>'The employees knew they were testing something, but they didn't know it was for the Apple Watch,' said Jeff Williams, Apple's senior vice president of operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>'We have traveled to Alaska and gone to Dubai to really test Apple Watch in all those environments,' said Jay Blahnik, Apple's director of fitness and health technologies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Blahnik also claimed Apple has amassed what may be one of the world's largest pieces of data on fitness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The company believes there's still a lot more to be done in regards to fitness, and that the impact on health could be profound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Earlier this week it was revealed Apple has secretly installed a 'hidden' fitness app on phones as part of its preparation for the launch of Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Hackers discovered the Fitness app only became visible when they fooled their phone into thinking it was paired with an apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The app allows users to see the fitness data their watch has collected, and to manage it and set their fitness goals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>'So the Fitness app does exist on 8.2, it's just hidden until you connect an Apple Watch,' he tweeted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The app has already been shown off by apple in the promotinal material for the watch - but it was not known when it would be made available to users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The iPhone app stores data captured by the Watch, and it can show stats over time as well as achievements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Unsurprisingly, the app can share data with the Health app, meaning users can see all their data in one place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>It is also used to control how much music is stored on the phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Apple is preparing for the for the April 24 shipping date of the Apple Watch, which it has pushed as a personal fitness trainer, capable of tracking steps and other metrics, such as heart rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>On the back of the Watch's case, a ceramic cover with sapphire lenses sits above a sensor that uses infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes to detect the wearer's heart rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Apple Watch uses this sensor, along with an accelerometer and the GPS and Wi-Fi in a connected iPhone, to measure physical movement such as steps, distance and calories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Yesterday Apple removed competing fitness bands from its retail stores as the company prepares to ship the the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Stores in San Francisco, Palo Alto, Los Angeles and New York reveal Apple no longer carries such popular bands as the Jawbone Up and the Nike+ FuelBand, both activity-tracking wristbands, according to Re/Code.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The devices has also been removed from the firm's online stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Earlier this week Apple shows off the Watch, which includes fitness apps as well as sensors to track heart rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Since its unveiling in September the Watch has been shrouded in mystery, with Apple's boss Tim Cook teasing features at every available opportunity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>But now everything - including its 'all-day' battery life has been announced - although the CEO added that with typical use this is more likely to be 18 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>What 'typical' use entails remains unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Prices for the Sport model start at $349 in the US and 299 in the UK, while the stainless steel Watch starts at $549 ( 479) and the Edition costs from a staggering $10,000 ( 8,000).</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>The most expensive model in the US will cost $17,000 ( 11,200).</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Mr Cook said at the event at Yerba Buena Centre in California: 'This is the most personal device we have ever created.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Apple initially announced its Watch in September at its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch event in California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The Apple Watch includes a fitness app that shows exactly how much activity the user has undertaken - and has led to Apple removing competing bands from its stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Apple's app can be used for a variety of sports, and be used to read the heart rate of its wearer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>It comes in three models: the Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition, and all models are sold in either 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>'We make products that enhance people's lives - and the Apple Watch takes that to a new level,' continued Mr Cook at the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>The Watch app is available from iOS 8.2 today, and Mr Cook added: 'We think Apple Watch will become integral to your day - so we have given it all day battery life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>The Apple Watch is made of stainless steel and prices range between $549 and $1048 for the 1.4-inch model and $599 and $1099 for the larger 1.7-inch version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Watch Sport is made of 7000 Series Silver Aluminum and ranges from $349 to $399.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>The premium Edition has a similar build to the Apple Watch but comes in 18-Karat Rose Gold and Yellow Gold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Prices start at $10,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>In the UK, the Sport starts at 299, the standard Watch starts at 479 and the Edition model will cost 8,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>The Apple Watch boasts a number of applications, including GPS navigation, a heart monitor, hands-free messaging and a personal trainer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>All of the watches can be pre-ordered from 10 April and goes on sale on 24 April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>They will be available in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the UK and the US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Apple CEO Tim Cook, right, and Christy Turlington Burns, founder of Every Mother Counts, discuss the new Apple Watch earlier today in San Francisco, California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Apple's Watch is available in three models: the Watch, Watch Sport and Watch Edition (shown) and all models will be sold in 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Interchangeable straps include fluoroelastomer (rubber), leather, and stainless steel and this will mean both left-handed and right-handed people can use the Watch by fitting the strap so the digital crown is on the opposite side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Connecting to the iPhone, the Apple Watch is designed as a wrist device for messaging and calls and for a variety of health tracking applications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>'With the built in speaker and microphone you can receive calls on your watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>I have been wanting to do this since I was five years old,' Cook said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>The watch is also integrated with Apple Pay's mobile wallet, and can be used to view pictures and monitor news, and also connect to social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>It can use other apps ranging from Uber ride-sharing to music to home automation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>'Now it's on your wrist, not in your pocket or your pocketbook,' Cook said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>Apple demonstrated using the watch to listen to music, with lyrics displayed on the watch face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>The company also demonstrated an app to open a garage door from afar to let in a family member who is locked out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>The Watch ranges between $549 and $1048 for the 1.4-inch model (left) and $599 and $1099 for the larger 1.7-inch version (right).</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>Watch Sport is made of 7000 Series Silver Aluminum (centre) and ranges from $349 to $399.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>The battery life, however, could be the Achilles heel of the Watch, experts have warned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>Apple defines the Apple Watch battery on its Watch product page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>It says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>The company says it takes 1.5 hours to charge the Watch to 80 per cent and 2.5 hours for a full charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>During a workout, when the heart rate sensor is switched on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>Apple claims that the Watch's battery can last up to seven hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>The battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music and up to three hours when the Watch is used for phone calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>Used just as a watch, it can last 48 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>When the Apple Watch's battery drops gets low, it switches into Power Reserve mode, allowing users to tell the time for 72 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>Apple has been trialling the watch with Christy Turlington Burns, who used it to run a half marathon in Kilimanjaro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>The Watch was also demoed by vice president Kevin Lynch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>'Using the watch is about brief interactions, just a few seconds at a time,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>From the stage he showed off the WeChat messaging app, and apps from Instagram, Twitter, American Airlines, Uber, Shazam and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>All of these apps are available from a dedicated section on the App Store that also comes with 'how to' videos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Before the event, reports from the Wall Street Journal claimed Apple was eyeing up a platinum version in a bid to market it as a high-end fashion item but these rumours were not confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>Instead, the $10,000 price tag related to the gold Edition model.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>This may sound pricey but by comparison Tag Heuer's Monaco Men's Watch costs $72,000 ( 47,600) and the Rolex GMT-Master II Mens Automatic Watch costs $373,720 ( 247,100).</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>Models: The Apple Watch will be available in three models: the Apple Watch, Watch Sport and Watch Edition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>All models will be sold in either 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions depending on which colour the owner chooses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>Apple Watch is made of stainless steel with a sapphire crystal Retina display and ceramic back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>Apple Watch Sport is made of 7000 Series Silver Aluminum with Ion-X Glass on a Retina display and composite back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>Apple Watch Edition has a similar build to the Apple Watch but comes in 18-Karat Rose Gold and Yellow Gold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>Interchangeable straps include fluoroelastomer (rubber), leather, and stainless steel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>Prices: Apple Watch is made of stainless steel and prices range between $549 and $1048 for the 1.4-inch model and $599 and $1099 for the larger 1.7-inch version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>In the UK, Sport starts at 299, the standard Watch starts at 479 and the Edition model will cost 8,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>Gestures: Following last year's unveiling, Apple admitted the Watch is unlike any device it has ever made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>It said it has 'reinvented all-new ways to select navigate and input that are suited to a smaller device worn on the wrist'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>The Watch is also said to be able to sense force adding 'a new dimension to the user interface'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>Force Touch uses electrodes around the flexible display to distinguish between a light tap and a deep press, and trigger instant access to a range of contextually specific controls - such as an action menu in Messages, or a mode that lets you select different watch faces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>Digital Crown: On mechanical watches, the crown has historically been used to set the time and date and to wind the mainspring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>113</td><td>Apple has adapted this and its 'digital' crown can be used to magnify content on the small display.</td></tr>
<tr><td>114</td><td>Rotating the digital crown replaces the typical pinching motion used on iPhones and iPads and allows wearers to zoom and scroll without obstructing the screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>115</td><td>Pressing the crown will also return wearers to the home screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>116</td><td>Watch OS: Apple has taken the iOS software on its phones and tablets and tweaked it to better suit the watch's power, display size and functions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>117</td><td>It has also invented a new typeface to make the screen easier to read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>118</td><td>Sapphire display: Apple Watches have a laminated Retina display made from a 'single crystal of sapphire.' While on the Sport collection the screen has the added protection of Ion-X glass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>119</td><td>Glances: The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>120</td><td>They can then swipe through different Glances, or tap on one to go directly to its corresponding app for more details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>121</td><td>Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>122</td><td>Vibration and notifications: The Watch has a built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>123</td><td>Any notification that appears on the connected phone will appear on the Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>124</td><td>This is made from a linear actuator, or motor, inside the Apple Watch that produces haptic feedback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>125</td><td>The wearer can then respond to these messages directly or swipe down to see the Notification Centre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>126</td><td>This haptic feedback could also be used with Apple Maps, for example, to help people navigate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>127</td><td>It will produced gentle vibrations to signal when to turn left or right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>128</td><td>The Watch additionally understands questions in messages and offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>129</td><td>And this taptic engine means people can get someone's attention with a gentle tap or send their heartbeat remotely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>130</td><td>There is no keyboard on the Watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji.</td></tr>
<tr><td>131</td><td>Siri is also built into the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>132</td><td>Heart rate sensor: On the back of the Watch's case, a ceramic cover with sapphire lenses sits above a sensor that uses infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes to detect the wearer's heart rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>133</td><td>Inductive charging: The Watch uses Apple's MagSafe technology with inductive charging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>134</td><td>This means it can be charged wirelessly by placing a connector near the back of the watch where magnets cause it to snap into place automatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>135</td><td>MagSafe is the name of the connector Apple uses with its MacBook range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>136</td><td>Battery life: Mr Cook was vague about the battery life of the Apple Watch when it was announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>137</td><td>He confirmed last month that it will last a full day after initially saying it will need to be charged overnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>138</td><td>The Apple Watch app is available from the App Store and can be downloaded today as part of the upgrade to iOS 8.2 (pictured).</td></tr>
<tr><td>139</td><td>HOW LONG WILL APPLE WATCH'S BATTERY LAST?</td></tr>
<tr><td>140</td><td>Ernest Doku, technology expert at uSwitch.com said: 'Apple claims this is the most advanced timepiece ever created but some of the features seem like the tech giant was scraping the barrel for unnecessary unique selling points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>141</td><td>'Digital Touch is essentially a personalised emoticons app with slightly classier graphics, for example.</td></tr>
<tr><td>142</td><td>'But gimmicks aside, this really is a elegant and luxurious gadget, while also being extremely useful for health and fitness fans, who it's heavily targeted at.</td></tr>
<tr><td>143</td><td>'Apple offers several versions of the same gadget in different metals, and a plethora of faces and straps, but that level of customisation is easily replicated by competitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>144</td><td>'Pricing will dictate how fast Apple Watches fly off the shelves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>145</td><td>'Although it's an aspirational brand, a starting price of 299 and rising into the thousands of pounds for a solid gold Edition means it's hardly cheap and - given this is a first of its kind - we don't yet know if it'll deliver on its promises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>146</td><td>Apple's Watch does what Google Glass and Pebble's smartwatch failed at - create a beautiful, elegant device that works as a piece of jewellery, without even switching it on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>147</td><td>Surprisingly light, the Watch oozes quality and attention to detail in the design and build.</td></tr>
<tr><td>148</td><td>Apple has gone to great lengths to show off the specialist materials used in its construction - and it shows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>149</td><td>While in images it looks a little chunky, on the wrist it's a different story - the rounded curve means it fits comfortably on the wrist, and the range of bracelets means there's one for pretty much every taste (for the record, I used the leather strap with magnetic 'slap band').</td></tr>
<tr><td>150</td><td>Using the Watch can be slightly confusing at first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>151</td><td>The combination of digital crown, button and touchscreen mean that for your first few tries, you'll probably press the wrong one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>152</td><td>However, after a few minutes it becomes second nature to navigate around, and the digital crown in particular is perfectly weighted, making scrolling through long lists such as music or your messages simple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>153</td><td>The touchscreen in particular is extremely accurate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>154</td><td>I didn't notice a single press in the wrong place, even on the main screen which has dozens of icons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>155</td><td>However, there is undoubtedly an initial confusion factor Apple will have to overcome, and the experience of buying one in Apple's Stores will be key to its success, as the Watch simply isn't a device you can just pick up and understand instantly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>156</td><td>However, once you've learnt how to get around, the Watch is fluid, fast and the screen astonishingly bright.</td></tr>
<tr><td>157</td><td>We were able to try all of its features, and found even in the beta version we were using, the software is spot on - animations are smooth and fluid, with watch faces such as an opening rose really showing off the screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>158</td><td>Overall, the Apple Watch is by far the best wearable device on the market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>159</td><td>Sadly, this is no indicator of success as there's simply not much in the way of competition for the 'normal' consumer, despite Google's attempts with Android Wear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>160</td><td>However, will people want one?</td></tr>
<tr><td>161</td><td>The selling point from my (admittedly short) time with the watch seems to be its timesaving potential.</td></tr>
<tr><td>162</td><td>As a phone addict, I'm constantly checking for messages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>163</td><td>Having that on my wrist, along with the ability to easily reply and to see responses, meant less time fiddling with my phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>164</td><td>As with the Apple iPhone when it was first introduced, one feels we are only seeing Apple's apps in detail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>165</td><td>When it ships on April 24th, developers around the world are expected to unleash a raft of apps - and much like the iPhone, these are what could really propel Apple Watch from being an elegant way to see your notifications to being a true new computing platform for Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>166</td><td>The watch seeks to make travelling easier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>167</td><td>Apple Watch will pull a boarding pass from Passbook when a user is near the airport so they can access it on their watch (pictured left).</td></tr>
<tr><td>168</td><td>In a 'day in the life with the Apple Watch' scenario, the watch can be used to buy lunch at places like Whole Foods (pictured left) using Apple Pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>169</td><td>'Apple is the only technology brand that has the potential to move from tech brand to luxury brand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>170</td><td>This is unprecedented,' Jan Dawson, chief technology analyst for Jackdaw Research, added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>171</td><td>'I think this is Apple flexing its muscles, moving into a space that it potentially has all to itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>172</td><td>The question is: how big is that market?</td></tr>
<tr><td>173</td><td>Is Apple eating into the market or making it bigger?</td></tr>
<tr><td>174</td><td>Mr Cook also explained more details about how customers will use the buttons on the side of the device, how its sensors work, and more details about Apple Pay on the Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>175</td><td>Apple's Watch works in a similar way to its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus when it comes to making payments through Apple Pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>176</td><td>To pay with Apple Watch, wearers will double-click the side button before holding the face of the Watch near the contactless reader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>177</td><td>Apple Watch also acts as credit card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>178</td><td>A gentle pulse and tone confirms that the payment information has been sent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>179</td><td>Apple Watch doesn't have TouchID but uses a skin sensor to keep it secure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>180</td><td>A wearer enters a security code and the Watch can then be used to make Apple Pay purchases all the while it detects the wearer's skin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>181</td><td>Once removed the feature is disabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>182</td><td>At the event Mr Cook also announced Apple Pay is now available on Coca Cola vending machines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>183</td><td>Apple Pay is now accepted at nearly 700,000 locations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>184</td><td>This has been touted as being significant for the health care industry and could help doctors monitor their patients more effectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>185</td><td>The move into the watch market comes months after Burberry's boss Angela Ahrendts joined as the new senior vice president of retail and sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>186</td><td>Apple's senior vice president of Operations Jeff Williams revealed the firm was working to use the iPhone in medical research.</td></tr>
<tr><td>187</td><td>'We're proud to announce ResearchKit,' said Mr William.</td></tr>
<tr><td>188</td><td>Apple worked with University of Oxford, Stanford and others to develop this project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>189</td><td>These apps turn the iPhone into a diagnostic tool, such as an app that can monitor finger taps, a person's voice and even how they walk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>190</td><td>For example, the team is working with Parkinson's researchers on an app that shows patients their problems, along with diabetes, asthma, heart disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>191</td><td>ResearchKit will launch next month and will be open source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>192</td><td>In October, a prototype of the Edition Watch appeared at Paris Fashion Week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>193</td><td>Elsewhere Apple is said to be launching standalone 'stores within stores' for its Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>194</td><td>However, some have speculated that without a solid grounding in the high-end retail market, the Apple Edition Watch could suffer the same flaws as most iPhones, which cease to efficiently function after a few years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>195</td><td>The popularity of the iPhone 6 drove the firm's market share in China to a record high, reaching 25.4 per cent by January 2015 - clouding out Samsung as the country's second-largest seller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>196</td><td>However, Xiaomi - widely dubbed 'the Apple of China' - remains firm with 27.6 per cent of the market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>197</td><td>Venturing into watches and potentially other wearables, with Ms Ahrendts at the helm, could be the leap that clinches it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>198</td><td>Mr Dawson said: 'They could really move into anything - necklaces, bracelets, brooches...It's not clear how those might feature a screen to function in the way that a watch does.</td></tr>
<tr><td>199</td><td>And according to Thomai Serdari, Luxury Brand Strategist and Lecturer at Sotheby's Institute of Art in New York, the details of the Edition model that have been released look promising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>200</td><td>App developers Conjure polled 2,000 adults and found more than 1 in 10 respondents (13 per cent) are planning to buy the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>201</td><td>The same number said that the design is their main reason for buying it.</td></tr>
