<h3>Colo. theater shooting suspect studied brain disorders</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this June 4, 2013 file photo, Aurora theater shooting suspect James Holmes is seated in court in Centennial, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Holmes faces trial starting on April 27, 2015, in the mass shooting in an Aurora, Colo., movie theater that left 12 dead and 70 wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>CENTENNIAL, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>- James Holmes was growing volatile well before he put on a gas mask and body armor, strapped on a rifle, shotgun, pistol and ammunition, and slipped into a midnight premiere of the Batman film "The Dark Knight Rises."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He was a sought-after neuroscientist-in-training, but he was falling apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He told a classmate he wanted to kill people, prosecutors say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He fell out of favor with his professors, who suggested he find a new career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He stopped seeing his psychiatrist, then sent her text messages so threatening that she alerted University of Colorado campus police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He even mailed her his journal, in a package with burned $20 bills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Months before Holmes opened fire on the audience on July 20, 2012, killing 12 and injuring 70 more in one of America's deadliest mass shootings, the 24-year-old doctoral student was preparing for violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He stockpiled weapons, ammunition, tear gas grenades and riot gear, and rigged his apartment to become a potentially lethal booby trap, cranking techno music in an apparent attempt to lure someone into opening his door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>One neighbor who came to complain narrowly avoided a fiery explosion by walking away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Many observers hope Holmes' death penalty trial beginning Monday will finally show what twisted a seemingly dedicated scholar into a sadistic killer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Prosecutors have suggested he was angry over his academic decline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But anyone looking for a trigger or tipping point with mass killers is usually disappointed, said J.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Reid Meloy, a forensic psychiatrist at the University of California, San Diego.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"There's no such thing as someone snapping," said Meloy, who is not involved in the Holmes case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"What we know now is that even if a person is psychotic, they can still plan and methodically go about the preparations to carry out a mass murder."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mass violence is usually premeditated, following a path that begins with a personal grievance and is complicated by narcissism and paranoia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But only 1 in 5 of these killers is psychotic, Meloy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Psychosis is something Holmes knew all about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Before the shooting, he was preparing to give a class presentation on "MicroRNA Biomarkers" that provide a biological basis for psychiatric and neurological disorders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>About the same time, he was amassing deadly firepower: Two Glock pistols.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A shotgun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>An AR-15 rifle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Boxes upon boxes of ammunition -- 6,295 rounds in all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Police who searched his apartment also found prescription medications for anxiety and depression, 50 cans and bottles of beer, paper shooting targets, and a "Batman" mask.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"He was absolutely out of his mind," said Denver defense attorney Iris Eytan, who initially represented Holmes but is no longer involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>She compared Holmes to schizophrenics she has defended: They are erratic and irrational; they hallucinate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Look at his eyes, they're completely dilated," she said, referencing a mug shot showing Holmes with hair dyed comic-book orange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"He was under the influence of something, and I believe it was mental illness," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Prosecutors say the meticulous plotting shows Holmes was deliberate and calculated, and that evidence suggests he knew right from wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>For example, Holmes searched online for "rational insanity," and took haunting selfies the night of the shooting, sticking out his tongue and smiling with a Glock under his face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"He didn't care who he killed or how many he killed, because he wanted to kill all of them," Prosecutor Karen Pearson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>After an emotionally wrenching trial lasting four months or more, the 12 final jurors, chosen from a pool of 9,000, will have to decide whether he was insane at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>If so, the 27-year-old inmate with a doughy face and vacant eyes who sits tethered to a courtroom floor will be committed indefinitely to a state psychiatric hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>If not, prosecutors will press for the death penalty over life in prison without parole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Holmes' former psychiatrist and two court-appointed doctors who spent days interviewing him will likely be asked questions that could explain how a seemingly harmless college student without so much as a traffic ticket on his record could march up and down the aisles of a stadium-style theater, mercilessly shooting down those who tried to flee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>His mother apparently has no idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He didn't do drugs or gamble or even stay out late, she says in a recently published book of poems and reflections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"What the hell happened?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Arlene Holmes writes in one, titled "Home Videos."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"How can the kid who read about the Berenstain Bears and John Stewart's Earth and Uncle John's Bathroom Reader, how could he change?" she asks in another, "Jim's Room."</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"I leave his room untouched because I need the memories and tangible evidence that he was a good person."</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"People think he is a monster, but he has a disease that changed his brain," she writes in another poem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>If Holmes' mother knows more about a mental illness, her book doesn't say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The family and their lawyers didn't respond to requests for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Holmes was a shy teen who rarely started conversations but graduated with highest honors from the University of California, Riverside, and then applied for elite doctoral programs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>In one essay, he wrote of mentoring a schizophrenic as a summer camp counselor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>The boy "vacuumed the ceiling of our cabin. These kids were heavily medicated but this did not solve their problems, only create new ones. ... I wanted to help them but couldn't."</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>In another, Holmes hinted at how his own mind worked, writing that he was "fascinated by the complexities of a long lost thought seemingly arising out of nowhere into a stream of awareness. These fascinations likely stemmed from my interest in puzzles and paradoxes as an adolescent and continued through my curiosity in academic research."</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>He landed at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus near Denver, one of just six students awarded entry into the exclusive doctoral program in June 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>He also earned a National Institutes of Health grant for top performers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>But by his second semester, his world was crumbling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>His professors sought to keep him out of their labs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>He flunked a key oral exam on June 7, and withdrew from the university three days later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>He saw his psychiatrist a final time, then pretty much fell out of sight, his former classmates said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Outside his 800-square-foot apartment in the suburb of Aurora, neighbors recalled seeing him alone, sometimes drinking beers at a nearby bar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>From July 5 to July 18 -- two days before the attack -- he logged onto a dating website with the handle "classicjimbo."</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>His profile said he was seeking "casual sex" and asked "Will you visit me in prison?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>When he showed up at the "Batman" movie dressed head to toe in protective gear, some theatergoers assumed he was part of the show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Then, he tossed tear gas canisters into the crowd and started shooting.</td></tr>
