<h3>Senior official says Germany won't be blackmailed by Greece</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN (AP) - Germany's Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel says his country won't let itself be blackmailed into a bailout deal with Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gabriel, who is also vice-chancellor, told German public broadcaster ARD on Sunday that Europe's patience with Greece is running out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece said Friday it would present its creditors with new proposals over the weekend in an attempt to breathe life into stalled bailout talks amid fears the country could go bankrupt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gabriel said "a couple of game theorists in the Greek government believe that in the end the fear in Europe that Greece might leave (the euro) is so great that we'll agree to anything. That's not the case."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He repeated the German government's position that Greece needs to commit to previously agreed reforms if it wants a deal.</td></tr>
