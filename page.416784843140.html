<h3>Report: 2.2 Million Iraqis Displaced by Islamic State Group</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Conflicts and violence worldwide displaced a record 38 million people in 2014, with 2.2 million Iraqis alone forced to flee the Islamic State group, a Norwegian humanitarian group report released Wednesday revealed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The findings of the study carried out by the Norwegian Refugee Council's Internal Displacement Monitoring Center are endorsed by the United Nations refugee agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a joint statement, they said 11 million were newly displaced last year - mostly because of conflicts in Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That's the equivalent of 30,000 people each day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"These are the worst figures for forced displacement in a generation, signaling our complete failure to protect innocent civilians" said Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 4.7 million increase compared to 2013 comes mostly from the Middle East and Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Iraqi civilians were the most displaced in 2014, with at least 2.2 million people fleeing the Islamic State group starting in June last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Intense fighting followed between the Sunni militants and Iraqi troops, Kurdish fighters and Shiite militiamen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Syria has the highest number of internally displaced, with 7.6 million dislodged because of their country's civil war, now in its fifth year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That's 35 percent of the population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In 2014, at least 1.1 million Syrians were newly displaced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>More than 220,000 people have been killed and 1 million wounded in the war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Also, the militant group Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria drove hundreds of thousands away, or three quarters of at least 975,300 displaced there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The report said that for the first time in more than a decade, Europe had massive enforced displacement caused by the war in Ukraine, where 646,500 people fled their homes last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Volker Turk, UNHCR's Assistant High Commissioner for Protection, said the longer conflicts lasts, the more the displaced are likely to become refugees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"As we have seen in the recent past, for example in the Mediterranean, despair drives people to take their chances and even risk dangerous boat journeys," Turk said.</td></tr>
