<h3>Known to Police, Tunisia Attackers Had Trained in Libya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>One of the two gunmen who killed tourists and others at a prominent Tunisian museum was known to intelligence services, Tunisia's prime minister said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But no formal links to a particular terrorist group have been established in an attack that threatens the country's fledgling democracy and struggling tourism industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Radicalized, trained in Libya, and already in police files, the two young men who shot dead 21 people at a renowned Tunisian museum embody what many see as the main threat to this North African country bent on building democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Celebrating the 59th anniversary of its independence Friday, Tunisia was coming to grips with the hundreds of disaffected youths who have sought training in weapons and battle skills in its chaotic eastern neighbor and elsewhere and are returning to threaten the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Tunisia has taken important steps in the political and democratic arena, which have been praised by the entire world. We must continue on this path," said President Beji Caid Essebsi in a televised holiday address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Wednesday attack on the National Bardo Museum, which left 20 foreigners, a Tunisian special forces officer and the two gunmen dead, was a "great disaster," he said, but pointed out that security measures were already being set up to prevent similar attacks in the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The gunmen, Hatem Khachnaoui and Yassine Laabidi, had slipped across the border in December to reach one of many militia camps in Libya, Rafik Chelli, a top Interior Ministry official said in a TV interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Since the ouster of Moammar Gadhafi three years ago, Libya has fallen into chaos and is now awash in well-armed militias fighting for control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On the anniversary of Tunisia's independence from France, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve became the first high level foreign official to visit the country in the wake of the attacks and he promised Tunisia material and intelligence help in fighting terrorism and strengthening its border security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The state has been considerably weakened by its porous borders between Libya and Tunisia," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The control of borders is important and we can work on it by mobilizing our skills and means."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The attackers followed a well-worn trail trekked by many young Tunisians who were disillusioned when the promises of the 2011 revolution were slow in coming and were radicalized in extremist mosques or through online religious propaganda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With authorities tightening control on airports, it was the land journey across the Libyan border that these young, jobless men would take, with many staying to join the ranks of radical groups in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Increasingly over the past year, there have been reports about Tunisians killed in the Libyan fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Several militias in Libyan cities like Derna in the east and Sirte in the center have declared allegiance to the Islamic State group, which has claimed responsibility for the attack in Tunis, describing the young gunmen as "knights" and promising more attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"As long as Libya stays as it is now, our country will still be threatened by these phenomena. So we have to look for a resolution in Libya," said Rachid Ghannouchi, the leader of Tunisia's powerful moderate Islamist Ennahda party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Speaking Friday at the opening of the latest round of peace talks between Libya's rival parliaments, UN envoy Bernardino Leon said the bombing in Tunisia added even more urgency to efforts to reconcile Libya's warring factions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It is another alarm sign that we have to take into account for what is going on in the region," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Terrorism in Libya is becoming a problem for Libyans and a problem for the region."</td></tr>

<h3>Capitol Hill Buzz: House Judiciary Committee enlists GIFs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>That doesn't mean they can't have fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The panel took an unusually lighthearted approach to immigration policy this week, posting a Buzzfeed-style listicle comprised of animated GIFs to illustrate the GOP's opposition to Obama's executive actions deferring deportations for millions of people in the U.S. illegally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Celebrities including Britney Spears, Jennifer Lawrence, Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig are featured exclaiming in horror and amazement at captions describing Obama's moves, and promoting a GOP bill that allows state and local governments to enforce immigration laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This is the best!" actress Emma Stone is shown exclaiming over a caption asserting that "By allowing hundreds of thousands of local law enforcement officers to enforce our immigration laws, we keep immigration enforcement up and operating, even when a president tries to unlawfully refuse to enforce our laws."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's just the latest example of politicians trying to co-opt popular culture or Internet trends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Obama appeared in a Buzzfeed video recently wielding a "selfie stick" to photograph himself with a smart phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>House Speaker John Boehner used a listicle of Taylor Swift GIFs earlier this year to attack Obama's proposal for free community college.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Judiciary Committee aides said the panel is always looking for more effective ways to communicate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As for any copyright concerns raised by the post, the committee argued GIFs are considered "fair use," meaning they can be widely shared by the public without permission from their creators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Judiciary Committee oversees copyright law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The immigrant advocacy group National Council of La Raza was not amused, calling the post "a case study in how to ignore facts and turn a heartbreaking situation for millions of American families into a juvenile BuzzFeed rip-off."</td></tr>
