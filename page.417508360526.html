<h3>In Tech: Microsoft tries to win mobile friends</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Looking for a new app for making "to-do" lists on your Apple or Android phone?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>You could use Apple's Reminders or Google's Keep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Microsoft is hoping you'll try Wunderlist, created by a German tech startup that Microsoft bought this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Microsoft's acquisition of German firm 6Wunderkinder this week for an undisclosed sum is part of its broader effort to win friends in the mobile world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It is still promoting its Windows operating software for smartphones, but relatively few consumers are buying Windows phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>So the company is also building a stable of apps for devices that run on Apple's iOS and Google's Android platforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That includes Android and iOS versions of Microsoft's Office programs, which the Redmond, Washington, company created in-house and released earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Then there's a mobile calendar called Sunrise, made by a company Microsoft bought in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Microsoft Corp. also bought the startup behind an email app called Accompli, which " like Sunrise and Wunderlist " has won praise from tech reviewers for its clean design and useful features.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Microsoft has since rebranded the Accompli app as "Outlook" for mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But it's still offering the Sunrise calendar and Wunderlist apps under their original names, while planning to use some of their features in other services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>All the apps have a free version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Microsoft hopes they'll eventually win people over to services that make money from subscriptions or ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Magic Leap, a secretive startup backed by Google, is working on a breakthrough that it promises will make people feel like wizards starring in their own personal Harry Potter movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Although the technology is still shrouded in mystery, Magic Leap CEO Rony Abovitz describes it as a way to manipulate "rivers of light" so digital content normally seen on the screens of personal computers and mobile devices appears as holograms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Geeks typically refer to this concept as "augmented reality."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Abovitz prefers to think of it as "cinematic" or "mixed" reality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We are giving people a paintbrush to paint all the world," Abovitz said Tuesday during a rare appearance at a San Francisco conference presented by the MIT Technology Review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Abovitz is still being cagey about when Magic Leap will begin selling its products, but it might not be too much longer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He revealed that the Dania Beach, Florida, company is planning to manufacture a "photonic lightfield chip" in a 300,000-square-foot plant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The expansion is being financed by Google Inc. and other prominent investors, including Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who have poured $592 million into Magic Leap so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Another sign of progress: Magic Leap is getting ready to release a software kit that will enable outside developers create games and other content that will work with the technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We are a dream factory where you dream something and then make it happen," Abovitz said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>INSTA-ADS?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Instagram's more than 300 million users will soon see a lot more advertisements in their feed of travelscapes, breakfast scones and stylish babies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>When Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, the popular, free photo-sharing app had no ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Since then, Instagram has been careful to only show a few, hand-picked ads in users' feeds, for fear of alienating its fiercely loyal following " or marring the Instagram experience. But we all knew that wouldn't last.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>This week, Instagram announced that it will make ads on its app "available to businesses of all types and sizes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Advertisers will also be able to target their messages to users based on their age, location and gender, as well as their interests and things they follow on Instagram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Working with Facebook, we will enable advertisers to reach people on Instagram based on demographics and interests, as well as information businesses have about their own customers," reads a blog post from Instagram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>To start, Instagram will be open to what it calls a "select group" of Facebook marketing partners and agencies, and will expand worldwide throughout the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>With contributions from AP Technology Writers Brandon Bailey and Michael Liedtke in San Francisco and Barbara Ortutay in New York.</td></tr>
