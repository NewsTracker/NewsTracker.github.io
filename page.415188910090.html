<h3>Saudis try to keep Islamic State from recruiting youth</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Saudis try to keep Islamic State from recruiting youth This story is the first in a series produced by The GroundTruth Project on government responses to the rise of the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Editor's note: This story is the first in a series produced by The GroundTruth Project on government responses to the rise of the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It is produced with support from the Henry Luce Foundation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia - A professor at the religiously conservative Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University recently asked a class of about 80 students if they personally knew someone who had joined the Islamic State, the radical jihadi movement terrorizing the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>To his surprise, 10 students raised their hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Under his probing, they each described a similar pattern: For about a month, the friend or relative ate and slept at home but "disappeared from his normal life cut his social connections and became more religious," recalled the professor, who asked not to be named.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Then one day, the person disappeared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Students related how some young men had sold their cars to pay for their plane ticket from Saudi Arabia to Turkey, then the underground network to spirit them through Turkey into Islamic State-held territory in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Though support for the Islamic State among Saudi youth is relatively low, it is enough to have officials deeply concerned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One poll last year found that only 5% of Saudis sympathize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"There is enough support in the population for Da'esh to make life difficult for the government," said one middle-aged Saudi who also asked not to be named, referring to the Islamic State by its Arabic acronym.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Young people are drawn to it, he said, "because it does what it says it is going to do" and by declaring an Islamic caliphate, "it is reviving the glory days of Islam."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Saudi officials fear the Islamic State's ideological attraction to Saudi youth will grow if it prolongs its hold over large swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq that it has declared an Islamic caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This is the challenge," said Ministry of Interior spokesman Gen. Mansour Al Turki.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The more these people have time to develop their propaganda, it will increase with time the number of people who will be inspired" to join.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Al Turki said 2,275 residents had left the kingdom to join extremist groups in Syria since 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Of those, 635 had come home, leaving 1,640 still with those groups - or dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Islamic State, whose brutality has shocked Muslims and non-Muslims alike, has declared Saudi Arabia a prime target and aims to win control of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That is very unlikely, but the group has made itself felt in the kingdom in recent months, especially since Riyadh joined the international coalition fighting the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The group has been responsible for shootings of foreigners and the murder of at least seven Shiite worshipers in Al Ahsa last November, as well as an attack on a Saudi border post along the northern border with Iraq that left three Saudi guards dead, according to official statements and media reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Islamic State has not mounted major, multipronged operations like the explosions and hostage-takings organized by al-Qaeda in 2003-2006 that killed scores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Still, officials do not disregard the Islamic State's potential, Al Turki said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Islamic State "is more of a threat than al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (because) it's better organized, it has established a base and is teaching children to be terrorists," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"They are better trained. I would not be surprised one day to see (Islamic State members) flying an air force jet because they appear to be formed of people with a military background."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In addition, the Islamic State is more sophisticated than al-Qaeda in its social media recruiting efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Its videos are slicker and its presence stronger on messaging sites such as Twitter that are popular with youths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In response to the Islamic State's appearance in the past year, the Saudi government has adopted tougher methods against alleged terrorists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A royal decree in February 2014 made it illegal for citizens to join conflicts abroad without official permission, setting a mandatory minimum of three years in prison for violating the order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Even the Islamic State recruits who return home to Saudi Arabia voluntarily aren't given the option of entering the government's militant rehabilitation program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Before the royal decree, we used to handle them through the rehabilitation program in coordination with the family," Al Turki said, "but now they go to jail."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>This change exacerbates a longtime problem for the government, which is that Saudi prisons are full of political prisoners who may get more radical in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Among the 392 people arrested in 2014 for alleged terrorism-linked activities, most were Saudis, and many of those were attempting to establish Islamic State support networks in the kingdom, according to Al Turki.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Of those, 97 had been through the government's militant rehabilitation program, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The royal decree that banned joining jihads outside the kingdom slowed but did not stop the outward flow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Of the 2,275 who have left since 2011, 355 departed after the decree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Saudi Arabia's problem is that the Islamic State's underlying ideological foundation is the same as that of Wahhabism, the dominant strain of Salafi Islam promoted by the Saudi state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>That foundation is a literalist reading of Islam's scriptures that is intolerant of other faiths and promotes a way of life like the earliest Muslims'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The big difference is that Wahhabism officially preaches obedience to the reigning Islamic ruler, whose permission is required for jihad and corporal punishments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>By contrast, the Islamic State declares jihad to be an individual duty for every Muslim, and it uses extreme violence, including beheadings and mass executions as a weapon against those who do not follow its strict interpretation of Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"These people are giving the impression that they are creating an Islamic state, which is a trap to delude and recruit young Muslims," Al Turki said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Young religious Saudis are susceptible to the Islamic State's message that Saudi Arabia, one of the most religiously conservative governments in the world, is un-Islamic because it allows women on Saudi television and permits females to study overseas on scholarships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>As a result, some Saudis have concluded that confronting the Islamic State's appeal requires giving religious authorities more leeway and a higher profile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>They were happy to see public overtures to the kingdom's conservative religious establishment made by King Salman, who ascended to the throne after the death of King Abdullah on Jan. 23.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"There is a general belief that King Abdullah did not succeed to fight the fanatics because he tried by liberal ways," said Abdullah Al Shammari, a political columnist for Al Youm newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"The only way to fight them is by religion by Islam. Now, the danger will be less because King Salman will fight Islamic State by the Quran, by the ulema (religious authorities), by religion."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Salman met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday in Riyadh to discuss regional issues, such as how to confront the Islamic State, which has declared some areas of Egypt to be part of its caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Last year, King Abdullah chided his clerical establishment for its "laziness" and silence because it was so reticent to condemn the Islamic State and its atrocities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>There is a tendency among clerical ranks to restrain from criticizing the group because it promotes Sunni interests against those of the minority Shiite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Although Saudi Arabia's highest religious authority, Grand Mufti Sheik Abdul Aziz Aal Al-Sheik, and other senior clerics have condemned the Islamic State, some Saudi religious scholars say the government and its religious allies don't do enough to counter its message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Sheik Adel Al Kalbani, a Wahhabi cleric, said at his Riyadh mosque that the terrorist group is making the same mistake as some other Salafi Muslims, which is "living the past in the present."</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>The Islamic State is "implementing the rules of the past or the traditions of the past in the present, while they should implement what the Quran and what the hadith (the collected sayings of prophet Mohammed) say in the present, taking the original principles and leaving the details," Kalbani said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>A true Salafi interpretation, he said, "is in the middle, not too strict and not too lenient. It is a middle religion."</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Kalbani said he sees a lot of support for the Islamic State on sites such as Twitter, though it is not possible to know how much comes from inside the kingdom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>He fears the extremists' lure will increase among Saudi youth if clerical authorities do not become more active in the ideological fight against it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>"The problem is with the (clerics)," he said, because they "don't explain things in detail. They usually talk in generalities. And they need to speak up more frequently especially to explain things to the young people. We should have intensive programs and discussions about Da'esh and discuss with people what is right and wrong."</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Kalbani said, "Outside people are not the problem; it's the inside people. When people inside Saudi Arabia are convinced by Da'esh ideas, that will harm Saudi Arabia. If we don't talk to young people, probably Da'esh is going to be a problem."</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Murphy is the author of "A Kingdom's Future: Saudi Arabia Through the Eyes of Its Twentysomethings."</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Her recent trip to Saudi Arabia was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.</td></tr>

<h3>Using Private Email, Hillary Clinton Thwarted Record Requests</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The department eventually responded, furnishing House committees with thousands of documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The State Department had not searched the email account of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton because she had maintained a private account, which shielded it from such searches, department officials acknowledged on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was only last month that the House committee appointed to investigate Benghazi was provided with about 300 of Mrs. Clinton's emails related to the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That was shortly after Mrs. Clinton turned over, at the State Department's request, some 50,000 pages of government-related emails that she had kept on her private account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was one of several instances in which records requests sent to the State Department, which had no access to Mrs. Clinton's emails, came up empty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In 2013, Nitasha Tiku, then a reporter for Gawker, filed a Freedom of Information Act request, seeking all correspondence on Mrs. Clinton's private email account between her and Sidney Blumenthal, a close adviser and onetime staff member in the Clinton White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some of those emails had already spilled into public view and been reported in the news media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But the State Department told Gawker that it could find no records responsive to the request, Gawker reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mrs. Clinton's aides on Tuesday sought to play down the significance of her exclusive use of a personal email account for State Department business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But an examination of records requests sent to the department reveals how the practice protected a significant amount of her correspondence from the eyes of investigators and the public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mrs. Clinton's exclusive use of personal email for her government business is unusual for a high-level official, archive experts have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Federal regulations, since 2009, have required that all emails be preserved as part of an agency's record-keeping system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In Mrs. Clinton's case, her emails were kept on her personal account and her staff took no steps to have them preserved as part of State Department record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In response to a State Department request, Mrs. Clinton's advisers, late last year, reviewed her account and decided which emails to turn over to the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The State Department says it will now search the 50,000 emails Mrs. Clinton provided in response to Freedom of Information and congressional requests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The White House, in its first response to the news, said it frowned on the practice of officials using their personal email accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"What I can tell you is that very specific guidance has been given to agencies all across the government, which is specifically that employees of the Obama administration should use their official email accounts when they're conducting official government business," the White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"However, when there are situations where personal email accounts are used, it is important for those records to be preserved consistent with the Federal Records Act."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But political groups and news organizations said requests for records related to Mrs. Clinton had repeatedly gone unanswered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In December, The Associated Press said its FOIA requests for records related to Mrs. Clinton's tenure at the State Department, the oldest of which was submitted in March 2010, were not answered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In addition to requesting Mrs. Clinton's schedules, The A.P. asked for correspondence related to Huma Abedin's special arrangement to serve as a top adviser to Mrs. Clinton and consult for private clients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Conservative groups have filed numerous requests for information about Mrs. Clinton as she prepares for a possible presidential run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Citizens United is expecting a court ruling on Friday about a lawsuit the group filed last year after the State Department would not disclose flight records that would have shown who accompanied Mrs. Clinton on overseas trips.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The group had intended to cross reference the agency's flight manifests with the donors who contributed to the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The FOIA request was just one of 16 appeals the group has made to the State Department since May that have gone unfulfilled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Those requests also included specific correspondence from Mrs. Clinton and her closest aides, including Cheryl D. Mills and Ms. Abedin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>America Rising, an anti-Clinton "super PAC," has submitted a dozen FOIA requests for State Department records beginning last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Requests included correspondence between Ms. Mills and Clinton Foundation leadership and Ms. Abedin's communication with members of Teneo, a private consultancy partly run by Doug Band, a longtime aide to former President Bill Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Ms. Abedin had a special arrangement that allowed her to work at the State Department and be paid by Teneo, which offers strategic advice to major global corporations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>America Rising also requested Mrs. Clinton's schedule during the annual Clinton Global Initiative gatherings in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In all cases, the State Department acknowledged receipt of the FOIA requests and assigned case numbers but did not produce any of the requested documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Unfortunately, Clinton's own political calculation and desire for secrecy, as evidenced by her exclusive use of personal email accounts while at State, is preventing an open process and full, fair review of her time there," said Jeff Bechdel, a spokesman for America Rising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>State Department officials have previously said they handle thousands of records requests and try to respond as quickly as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>On Tuesday, Alec Gerlach, a spokesman for the department, defended the agency, and stressed that it was working diligently to comply with the voluminous requests for information from the Republican-controlled House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Adrienne Elrod, a spokeswoman for Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton group, called the issue of Mrs. Clinton's using personal email "manufactured controversy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>In a written statement, the National Archives said it had "reached out to the State Department to ensure that all federal records are properly identified and managed in accordance with the Federal Records Act and that controls and procedures are in place to manage records effectively in the future."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Mrs. Clinton's aides have said her use of private email was not out of the ordinary, pointing to the fact that former Secretary of State Colin Powell also used a personal email account, before the current regulations went into effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But since 2009, said Laura Diachenko, a National Archives and Records spokeswoman, federal regulations have stated that "agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency record-keeping system."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The rules are designed to ensure a contemporaneous record of government activity is being kept so it will be available to members of Congress, the news media, historians and ordinary citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Secretary of State John Kerry uses a government email account, and his correspondence is preserved as part of the department's record-keeping system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on March 4, 2015, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Using Private Email, Clinton Thwarted Records Requests.</td></tr>
