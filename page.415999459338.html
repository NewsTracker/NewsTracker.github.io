<h3>Kenya mourns victims of student massacre with Easter prayers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Easter ceremonies across the country were due to be held in the memory of the students and security personnel killed in a country where 80 percent of the population is Christian, with flags flying at half-mast in a show of respect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Alarm bells rang in Kenya's elite Recce Company in Nairobi as soon as the first reports of Thursday's pre-dawn attack around 5:30 am emerged in Garissa, a northeastern town some 365 kilometres (225 miles) from the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But it would take until just before 2:00 pm until the main team reached the attack site, Kenya's major Nation newspaper said, noting that the first airplane carried the interior minister and police chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This is negligence on a scale that borders on the criminal," the Nation wrote in its editorial on Sunday, recalling how survivors said "the gunmen, who killed scores of students with obvious relish, took their time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some journalists based in Nairobi who drove to Garissa after hearing the first reports of the attack arrived before the special forces, who came by air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Standard newspaper's editorial cartoon accused security forces of sleeping on the job, depicting a snake labelled "terror threat" waking a snoring security officer with a bite, as a dog barks, "too little, too late".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The day-long seige that began long before dawn in Garissa, close to the border with Somalia, claimed 148 lives, including 142 students, three police officers and three soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>About an hour before darkness fell, around 5:00 pm, troops moved in on the dormitory where the gunmen were holed up, apparently determined to prevent the siege lasting overnight as seen in the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in September 2013, when Shebab fighters killed at least 67 people over four days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It... beggars belief that many of the failures that were witnessed during the Westgate siege -- including the late deployment of specialised police -- were repeated in Garissa," the Nation added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed defended the response, telling AFP on Saturday that "fighting terrorism... is like being a goalkeeper. You have 100 saves, and nobody remembers them. They remember that one that went past you."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka also dismissed the criticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"If you look at how we responded it was not bad at all, say, compared to Westgate," he told the Nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Islamist militants lined up non-Muslim students during the massacre Thursday, taunting them and then executing them in Shebab's bloodiest attack to date, with President Uhuru Kenyatta warning they would face justice for the "mindless slaughter" and vowed to retaliate in the "severest way" to the killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The massacre was Kenya's deadliest attack since the 1998 bombing of the US embassy in Nairobi, and Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning beginning Sunday, calling for the killings to unite and not divide the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Earlier on Saturday, the Shebab warned of a "long, gruesome war" unless Kenya withdrew its troops from Somalia, and threatened "another bloodbath".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hours after Shebab's warning, police in Garissa paraded four corpses of the gunmen piled on top of each other face down in the back of a pick up truck followed by a huge crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Police insisted the grim display was to see if anyone could identify the assailants, but some onlookers threw stones at the bodies as they passed, while others jeered and shouted at the dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In Nairobi's ethnic Somali district demonstrators took to the streets protesting against the Shebab, calling for unity in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Five men have been arrested in connection with the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Forensic investigators continued to scour the site where one student shocked security forces -- who had said all students were accounted for -- by emerging unharmed from a wardrobe where she had hidden for over two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A Kenya Red Cross spokeswoman said that the 19-year old was traumatised and dehydrated, but physically unharmed and undergoing assessment by doctors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Over 600 students from the now closed college on Saturday boarded buses for the home towns around the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said five arrests had already been made, including three "coordinators" captured as they fled towards Somalia, and two others in the university.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The names of the three suspected organisers were not given, but Njoka said the two arrested on campus included a security guard at the university, and a Tanzanian named as Rashid Charles Mberesero, found "hiding in the ceiling" and holding grenades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A $215,000 (200,000 euro) bounty has also been offered for alleged Shebab commander Mohamed Mohamud, a former Kenyan teacher said to be the mastermind behind the Garissa attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Kenyatta said it was clear terrorist masterminds were operating inside Kenya and not just Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"The planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities," he said, warning that "radicalisation is happening openly" in Islamic schools by "rogue" preachers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We will... stop at nothing to avenge the deaths of our Muslim brothers until your government ceases its oppression and until all Muslim lands are liberated from Kenyan occupation," the Shebab said in a statement released Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Until then, Kenyan cities will run red with blood... This will be a long, gruesome war of which you, the Kenyan public, are its first casualties."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>On Saturday, United States embassy vehicles were seen entering the campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In past attacks, including the Westgate massacre, FBI investigators helped Kenyan police with forensic examinations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Forensics and investigations are still going on," Njoka said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The Shebab on Saturday described how they had specifically singled out non-Muslims to kill, gathering them together before executing them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"The mujahedeen stormed the university compound and swiftly proceeded to the halls of residence where they had gathered all the occupants," the Shebab statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"And since the attack targeted only non-Muslims, all Muslims were allowed to safely evacuate the premises before executing the disbelievers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Kenya: Garissa University massacre I.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Vericourt / G.</td></tr>
