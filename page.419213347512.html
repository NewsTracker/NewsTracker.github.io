<h3>Arrested in Ferguson Last Year, Washington Post Reporter Is Charged</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A reporter for The Washington Post, arrested while covering the protests in Ferguson, Mo., last August, has been charged with trespassing, the newspaper said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The reporter, Wesley Lowery, was arrested at a McDonald's restaurant while covering nightly demonstrations that followed the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by Darren Wilson, a white police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In an account Mr. Lowery wrote of the incident, he said he had been arrested after receiving contradictory instructions from the officers about which direction to exit the restaurant, which had served as a kind of staging area for reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At the time, the Post's executive editor, Martin Baron, said that there had been "absolutely no justification for his arrest."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Post reported Monday that Mr. Lowery had been ordered to appear in a St. Louis County municipal court on Aug. 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"You'd have thought law enforcement authorities would have come to their senses about this incident," Mr. Baron said in a statement to his own newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Wes Lowery should never have been arrested in the first place. That was an abuse of police authority."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A spokesman for the St. Louis County executive did not respond to a message seeking comment Monday evening.</td></tr>
