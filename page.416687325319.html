<h3>Frank Olivo, Santa pelted with snow at '68 Eagles game, dies (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The fill-in Santa whose downfield jaunt at a Philadelphia Eagles game in 1968 lives on in sports history for the hail of snowballs and shower of boos that rained down on him has died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Frank Olivo was 66.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Olivo died early Thursday at a suburban hospital after a long battle with heart disease, diabetes and other ailments, said his cousin, Richard Monastra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''It was his 15 minutes of fame,'' Monastra said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The snowy onslaught began with the real Santa Claus stuck in New Jersey and unable to make it to the final game of the season between the Minnesota Vikings and a moribund Eagles team that started the season with 11 straight losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Olivo, who was in the stands wearing a Santa suit and fake white beard, was asked to fill in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But when he ran downfield past a row of elf-costumed ''Eaglettes'' and the team's 50-person brass band playing ''Here Comes Santa Claus,'' thunderous boos erupted from the crowd of 54,535 and snowballs began raining down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The halftime behavior during the team's final home game, broadcast around the country on Howard Cosell's national sports show, helped cement Philadelphia's reputation for rowdy sports fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Monastra, who was at the game that night, said he believes the fans were unhappy with the team, which lost the game to finish 2-12, and coach Joe Kuharich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''They were ticked off at the team, they were ticked off at the coach,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But he said his cousin and a great sense of humor and took it in stride, even telling one nearby fan who pelted him that he could expect coal in his stocking on Christmas morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Olivo was a barber by trade, and had his own shop for a while, then spent two decades in the casino industry in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Monastra said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He later sold cars and worked in the mortgage industry before ill health forced him to retire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''He was a very nice man, very generous, helped out everybody whenever he could,'' Monastra said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Monastra said his cousin embraced his moment of sports infamy.</td></tr>
