<h3>EIi Manning not looking to be the NFL's top paid quarterback (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning (10) throws against the Cincinnati Bengals during the first half of an NFL preseason football game in Cincinnati, Friday, Aug. 14, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Eli Manning didn't ask the New York Giants to make him the NFL's highest-paid quarterback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A perplexed and slightly miffed Manning on Wednesday shot down a report that he wants to be the league's top-paid quarterback, insisting that was not the goal in contract talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''Never been said, never come out of my mouth,'' Manning said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The two-time Super Bowl MVP is in the final year of a contract that will pay him a $17 million base salary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His agent, Tom Condon, has been negotiating a new deal, but the two sides are not close to an agreement, Giants co-owner John Mara said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Manning insisted neither he nor Condon told the Giants to make him the highest-paid quarterback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said he speaks with Condon occasionally, but he isn't looking for constant updates on the talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''If something comes up, I ask him to call me and keep me updated or send me a text, but that's it,'' Manning said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Aaron Rodgers of the Packers currently is the NFL's highest-paid quarterback, earning $22 million annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 34-year-old Manning has spent all 12 of his NFL seasons with the Giants, so he knows how people in the New York-area react to headlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>For those who know him, it's totally out of character to make such a demand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Manning even received a telephone message from his father asking what was happening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''I don't know how all negotiating goes and what is being asked,'' Manning said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''I don't think I want to know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Manning said he does not compare himself to other quarterbacks by salary, and right now he is not thinking or concerned about his contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''My focus is on practice and getting the best out of our practices and getting better,'' Manning said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''That's all I am focused on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Nothing has changed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Nothing is different.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Reports are all wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>I don't know where they are getting their information from.</td></tr>
