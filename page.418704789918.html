<h3>Apple third-quarter profit, revenue beat expectations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple didn't provide sales figures in its earnings release for Apple Watch, but said the launch of the device was successful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple Inc. once again exceeded Wall Street expectations, reporting profit of $10.7 billion, or $1.85 per share, on revenue of $49.6 billion for its fiscal third quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Industry analysts had expected profit of $10.3 billion, or earnings per share of $1.78, on revenue of $49 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The growth was fueled by record third-quarter sales of iPhone and Macs, all-time record revenue from services and what Apple called the "successful launch of the Apple Watch," although it didn't provide sales figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the same quarter a year earlier, Apple reported revenue of $37.4 billion and profit of $7.7 billion, or $1.28 per share.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Cupertino, Calif., company sold 47.5 million iPhones, 10.9 million iPads and 4.8 million Macs during the three months ended June 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Revenue from iPhones totaled $31.37 billion, up 59% year-over-year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Still, it wasn't the blowout quarter that Apple is used to, and shares quickly began falling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>About 15 minutes after the earnings report was released at 1:30 p.m. PDT, Apple's stock was down about 6.5% in after-hours trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The company's fiscal third quarter was especially noteworthy because it included the launch of the Apple Watch in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Although analysts and investors would love to know how many watches the company has sold, Apple said last year that it did not intend to break out specific Watch sales numbers as it does for the iPhone, iPad and Macs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Instead, the Apple Watch has been lumped into the company's "other products" category, which includes iPods and accessories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It seems appropriate to start it that way," Chief Executive Tim Cook said in October when he announced the plan to bundle Watch sales figures with those of other products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Also, to be straight, I'm not very anxious in reporting a lot of numbers on Apple Watch and giving a lot of detail on it because our competitors are looking for it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>So analysts will have to "figure out how to extrapolate from that number," said Tim Bajarin, a longtime Apple watcher and president of Creative Strategies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>His estimate is that Apple sold 4.1 million to 4.3 million Apple Watches in the quarter; other industry analysts have predicted a lower 3.3 million figure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Apple said its "other products" category pulled in $2.64 billion in revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Gross margin for the quarter was 39.7% compared with 39.4% in the year-ago quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>International sales accounted for 64% of revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Shares of Apple closed down $1.32, or 1%, to $130.75 during regular trading on Tuesday.</td></tr>
