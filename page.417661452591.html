<h3>Suicide bomber attacks Egypt's Luxor temple tourist site</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A suicide bomber has blown himself up at an ancient Egyptian temple near Luxor popular with tourists, security sources and witnesses said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bomber attacked the Karnak temple in the southern Egyptian city on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>According to initial reports, he blew himself up in the parking lot of the tourist site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>&#x2022; Is it safe for tourists to return to Egypt?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Egypt's state news reported that no tourists were injured, citing an anonymous "senior security source".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They said three armed men tried to storm a barricade that leads to the Karnak temple site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Two men left the car and engaged in gunfire with police, who killed them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The third man in the car managed to overcome the barricade and blew himself up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However, Egypt's interior minister claimed that the purported bomber had only been wounded, and two other attackers killed, in what he described as a "foiled terrorist attack".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The city is frequented by millions of foreign and Egyptian tourists every year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The attack was the first to target world-famous attractions in Luxor since November 1997, when Islamic militants opened fire on tourists at the city's 3,400-year-old Hatshepsut Temple on the west bank of the Nile, killing 58.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>No group immediately claimed responsibility but Islamist militants bent on toppling the Cairo government have killed hundreds of police and soldiers in the past, usually at checkpoints and barracks or police stations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Gunmen on a motorcycle shot dead two members of Egypt's tourism and antiquities police force on a road near the Giza pyramids last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In 2014, Egypt&#x2019;s prime minister issued a warning to the tourism industry after a terror group claimed a suicide bombing on a bus which killed three South Koreans and threatened to stage more attacks.</td></tr>
