<h3>French, German presidents tried to influence World Cup votes - Blatter in paper</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN (Reuters) - The embattled president of FIFA, the governing body for world football, told a German newspaper the presidents of France and Germany tried to exert political pressure before the World Cup was awarded to Russia and Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sepp Blatter has become entangled in a corruption investigation of the sport's governing body, which involves the decision to hold the World Cup in the two countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blatter has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but he has retained an attorney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In a story published on Sunday, the newspaper Welt am Sonntag quoted Blatter as saying: "Before the World Cup was awarded to Russia and Qatar, there were two political interventions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Mr (Nicolas) Sarkozy and (Christian) Wulff tried to influence their voting representatives. Therefore, we now have a World Cup in Qatar. The people who decided this should also take responsibility," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>No one was immediately available at Sarkozy's office or Wulff's office to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Welt am Sonntag reported, however, that Wulff had denied trying to influence the vote in his book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In May, Swiss authorities arrested seven FIFA officials as part of an investigation into a global bribery scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The U.S. Department of Justice has now asked that Switzerland extradite the seven to the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Also in May, U.S. prosecutors announced they had indicted nine current and former FIFA officials and five sports marketing businessmen in connection with a corruption investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Welt am Sonntag quoted Blatter as saying the German football federation, DFB, had "received a recommendation (from Wulff) that Germany should vote for Qatar for economic interests".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>FIFA said Blatter was correctly quoted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Europe football chief Michel Platini has repeatedly said that nobody had asked him to vote for Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Neither Sarkozy nor anyone," he told the newspaper L'Equipe a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, the head of UEFA also said that he and Sarkozy had a lunch with Qataris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's true that, when I was invited for a lunch in private with the president and I found myself with Qataris, I understood that there was a subliminal message. But I've never been asked to vote for them," Platini told L'Equipe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Blatter announced on June 2 he would step down as FIFA's president after an election that is likely to happen this year or early next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Blatter also told the paper he needed a "recovery phase" and said he was limiting his travel plans because of the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I won't take any travel risks until everything has been cleared up," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He did, however, say he would go to Moscow at the end of July for the draw on the qualification games for the 2018 World Cup are held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I will go there," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A U.S.-based layer said last week Blatter would not travel to Canada for Sunday's final of the women's World Cup for personal reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Reuters was unable to determine why Blatter had decided not to attend the final in Vancouver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Some lawyers with experience in international criminal cases have said Blatter would be ill-advised to travel after the U.S. indictments were announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Blatter said he did not mind criticism but "tirades of hate hurt".</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I am now here to fight. Not for myself but for FIFA ... I am afraid that they want to destroy FIFA ... A work that I helped create," he was quoted as saying.</td></tr>
