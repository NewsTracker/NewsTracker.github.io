<h3>Nigeria Boko Haram victories may not boost Jonathan in poll</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nigeria holds presidential elections on March 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>LAGOS (Reuters) - A spate of victories against Boko Haram has pushed the militants out of much of the territory they controlled in Nigeria, but that is unlikely to do much to boost President Goodluck Jonathan's bid for re-election by divided voters next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At the start of this year the Islamist militants had seized an area the size of Belgium in Africa's biggest economy and were slaughtering civilians at will, a crisis authorities cited as a reason for delaying the poll by six weeks to March 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Boko Haram is now on the run and squeezed into ever smaller turf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That still won't help John Dauda get his family back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The military operations going on now mean nothing to me because I lost my two wives and four children," the 52-year-old fuel dealer in northeastern Adamawa state said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For that reason, Jonathan will not be getting his vote when he goes into one of the polling booths to be set up in camps for the more than a million people who, like Dauda, have been displaced by fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jonathan, a Christian southerner, has been criticized for failing to tackle the insurgency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His main challenger, Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim from the north, has campaigned on his reputation for being tough on security when he was military ruler of Nigeria in the 1980s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Nigeria's army said on Tuesday it had taken back all but three local government areas, out of around 20 controlled by Boko Haram, a shift owing partly to neighbors Chad, Cameroon and Niger stepping up offensives against the Islamists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It may have come too late to alter perceptions of Jonathan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Why did he have to wait until now that the elections are here? Recapturing those towns is like 'medicine after death'," computer science student Joe Garba, 38, said, shaking his head as he turned away from his keyboard in his university classroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With Nigeria facing its closest election since the end of military rule in 1999, victory on the battlefield won't automatically mean victory at the ballot box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Morris Adaka, a 50-year-old retired civil servant in Yenagoa, capital of Jonathan's Niger Delta home state of Bayelsa where the president is expected to do well, wondered why it took the government six years to take action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"If this measure of seriousness had been deployed early enough, the Chibok girls wouldn't have been kidnapped," he said, referring to the abduction of around 200 schoolgirls in April last year by Boko Haram to worldwide horror.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Thomas Hansen, a senior analyst at Control Risks, said the media narrative around Jonathan had improved, but that "most people in Nigeria seem to have already made up their minds about who they will vote for in the elections".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Not all oppose the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Edet Edet, a cook in Abuja, made up his mind to vote Jonathan a while ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"It's not his fault that Boko Haram killed people. To be winning the battle makes me like him even more," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>What this means, says Bismark Rewane, CEO of Lagos-based advisory group Financial Derivatives, is "the military offensive has reduced the hemorrhaging of popularity that Jonathan has been experiencing, but it hasn't turned into a catalyst for support".</td></tr>

<h3>Man Marries Diabetes in Downtown New York City</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The invitation read "Marry the Beast," and more than 100 people were in attendance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The marriage was actually a commitment ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Paul Binder renewed the vows he had made to his Type 2 diabetes when diagnosed 18 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Paul Binder is founder of New York's Big Apple Circus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Yet don't let that make you think this ceremony was an act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Binder says, "Making my vows again to my diabetes I had a real and deep sense of commitment and renewal. Saying them out loud in front of a group of people, some of whom are my oldest friends, made me feel tremendously supported."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The ceremony was part of an event staged by The Betes, an organization expanding narrative medicine to include healing through theatre and play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Marina Tsaplina, The Betes' founder, is the 20th in my series on diabetes change agents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At 28 she is helping us see and transform our chronic illness "stories" to heal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Marina Tsaplina (on right) founder of The Betes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Photo courtesy of Tsaplina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tsaplina is a performing artist, puppeteer and executive and artistic director of The Betes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She told me the idea of a wedding first came to her last July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We were in the middle of developing The Betes programs," Tsaplina explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Our focus on emotional health in the face of chronic illness made me confront my own pain and lifelong journey with diabetes. Wanting to embrace my struggle I thought what if I marry my diabetes?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"My dear friend Barbara Ann Michaels is a wedding officiant so she performed the ceremony. To my complete surprise during the ceremony I found myself saying, 'I love you,' to the character I'd developed for my diabetes. Immediately, I understood the value of this ceremony. Also, that it perfectly fit The Betes' work, helping people visualize, verbalize and externalize their chronic illness stories."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Betes has a big mission: To remind us that health care is a human story and that empathy and seeing the whole patient, not just their disease, needs to be at the heart of the patient-provider interaction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Most importantly Tsaplina says is, "To help people transform their relationship with their illness. As we un-demonize our illness and treat it more tenderly, we see the many layers of meaning it holds for us. Then we are able to embrace our illness and become more whole."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tsaplina long thought of her own Type 1 diabetes, which she got at the age of 2, as her "beast."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"But then I realized that all that I was going through, my struggle with depression and low self-esteem, not just my diabetes, were my beast," Marina said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"No one has to see their illness as a beast, but there is probably something that is attached to it that needs to be heard and healed. That said, our work doesn't 'cure' or 'treat' the physical disease. It helps make the burden lighter and the person feel more free."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Betes' artistic director and producer is Deborah Kaufmann.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Kaufmann is a founding member of Big Apple Circus Clown Care, the world's first professional hospital clowning program and the recipient of the Raoul Wollenberg Humanitarian Award for her work with Clown Care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Kaufmann has entertained thousands of ill children in hospitals and trained all of the "Clown Doctors" who participate in the program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Play, humor, joy, being open and bringing our stories out into the light, these are things we seldom talk about in chronic illness and never see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Yet, as in narrative medicine's therapeutic story-telling, these are centuries old means through which to connect to, and transform, our stories of hardship to heal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That night as we watched Paul on stage with his officiate, sipping our wine, gladdened to be among friends who share diabetes and many esteemed health professionals, we witnessed a new ritual -- a public commitment to one's own health care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Rituals allow us to soften grief, heighten confidence and mark an event as significant and meaningful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>As did Paul's face reading his vows and taking his old partner, diabetes, into his heart anew to tend to and to love as long as they both shall live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Should you like to arrange your own commitment ceremony, "Marry the Beast" or a service for healthcare teams to reaffirm commitment to their practice, "Marry the Care" contact The Betes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Riva's latest book, Diabetes Dos & How-Tos, is available in print and Kindle, along with her other books, 50 Diabetes Myths That Can Ruin Your Life and the 50 Diabetes Truths That Can Save It and The ABCs Of Loving Yourself With Diabetes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Riva speaks to patients and health care providers about flourishing with diabetes.</td></tr>
