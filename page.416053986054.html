<h3>Greece says Germany owes it $400 billion</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Germany owes Greece more than 278 billion euros ($400 billion) in war payments, including 10 billion euros for a forced loan taken by Nazi occupation forces, a junior Greek minister has told parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"According to our calculations, the debt linked to German reparations is 278.7 billion euros, including 10.3 billion euros for the so-called 'forced loan'," junior finance minister Dimitris Mardas told the chamber on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Mardas added that the relevant data had been compiled by Greece's state general accounting office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece's new radical government that came to power in January says German war reparations are a "moral issue" that must still be resolved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told German Chancellor Angela Merkel as much during a visit to Berlin last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greece said last month that it was prepared to activate a 15-year-old Greek Supreme Court ruling that authorised the seizure of German assets in Greece to pay for wartime atrocities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Berlin argues that the issue of reparations to Greece has already been settled, and points to payments made in 1960 as part of an agreement with several European governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And Berlin maintains that a treaty signed by the two former Germanys with the Allies in 1990 to formally end World War II effectively drew a line under possible future claims for war reparations.</td></tr>
