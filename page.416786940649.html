<h3>Apple Dives Back into Bond Market</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple Inc. is back in the bond market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The tech giant is looking to complete a large bond deal Wednesday, though no size has been set yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The company says it will use the proceeds to help pay for share buybacks and dividends, part of an expanded capital-return program for shareholders the company announced last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple is offering the bonds in up to seven parts, with maturities ranging from two to 30 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Investors have said previously that they were expecting Apple to tap the market, given that the company has sold bonds around this time the past two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apple's bond sale comes after a number of large bond deals from highly rated companies, as issuers take advantage of the continued low-interest rate environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Tuesday, AbbVie Inc. sold $16.7 billion, and last month, AT&T Inc. sold $17.5 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Earlier in the year, Actavis PLC placed a $21 billion deal.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>Strong iPhone sales helped boost the company's performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Some outstanding Apple bonds traded slightly lower in price, and higher in yield, on Wednesday morning, as some investors sold in anticipation of the new deal.</td></tr>
