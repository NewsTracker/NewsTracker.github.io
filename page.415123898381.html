<h3>Ukrainian model Anna Duritskaya was with Boris Nemtsov when he was murdered</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A beautiful Ukrainian model may hold the key to identifying the assassins who gunned down top Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Anna Duritskaya, 23, was with the charismatic pro-Western reformer when he was killed in a drive-by shooting in view of the Kremlin as they walked home from a restaurant in Red Square on Friday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ms Duritskaya, who was not injured, was questioned by police for several hours and only released at 5am yesterday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Last night, friends of the couple said they feared the Russian authorities were trying to implicate Ms Duritskaya in what is believed to be a politically motivated murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>One said: 'She is the victim of appalling innuendo as she grieves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Even as world leaders, including Barack Obama and Angela Merkel, condemned the killing of one of President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critics, pro-Kremlin media organisations were hinting darkly that Ms Duritskaya's 'role' needed to be 'clarified'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>One Putin-supporting online newspaper, Life News, reported that she had recently had an abortion and suggested - with no evidence to back up the claim - that the couple might have had a row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It quoted a 'high-ranking' state investigator as saying: 'The girl who accompanied Boris Nemtsov at the moment of his murder is a citizen of Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'We have found out that not long ago she flew from Moscow to Switzerland to abort a baby fathered by the politician.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Nemtsov, 55, died hours after appealing for support for a march today in Moscow against the war in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He had openly opposed Russia's role in the conflict and the annexation of Crimea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Yesterday, flowers were laid at the spot where he died, and today's rally is to be replaced by a mourning procession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Nemtsov, a father of four, was hit in the back by four bullets fired from an unmarked car, which then sped away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His body lay in falling snow for an hour before it was placed in a black body bag and taken away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Nemtsov's lawyer, Vadim Prohorov, said he believed the motive for the shooting was Mr Nemtsov's opposition to Mr Putin and the war in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The lawyer said his client had suffered constant harassment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Boris Nemtsov knew he might one day be silenced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Now the shocking pictures of his body prostrate in the shadow of the Kremlin is a chilling symbol of Vladimir Putin's gangster style of presidency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It is almost irrelevant whether Putin personally ordered the killing or merely created the circumstances in which critics of his rapacious regime and adventurism in Ukraine are gunned down in cold blood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>For Nemtsov's courageous and consistent criticism of Putin is underscored now in his own blood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>I spent time with this charming and charismatic politician during the brief flickering of the 'Russian Spring' in 2011 and 2012, protests that rattled Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He told me he saw it as his patriotic duty to oppose a regime leading the nation to ruin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>'People are tired of corruption, tired of criminals, tired of Putin's brutality and stupid remarks,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But while impatient for change, he was scared of seeing street unrest turn into another explosive revolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>'Peaceful protest is the way to separate Putin from the people,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>I watched as he grew frustrated in chaotic meetings of people leading the protests - then joined him in a television studio as he had to apologise for belittling supporters as 'scared penguins' in bugged phone calls leaked to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Yet Nemtsov's own bravery could not be faulted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>As other opposition leaders were jailed, exiled or placed under house arrest, he continued to campaign against the former KGB chief who runs his country like a mafia boss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>His death came hours after a radio interview denouncing Putin's 'mad, aggressive' policies and on the eve of a rally today against the war in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Nemtsov was working on a report highlighting Russia's involvement in the separatist revolt in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>These were dangerous activities amid the ugly mood of nationalism inflamed by Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Smear lists of 'traitors' and 'fifth columnists' are bandied around by broadcasters and on the internet, Nemtsov's name always among them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Few doubt killings such as this bear the hallmarks of the old KGB - just as the mysterious bombings of residential buildings that began three weeks after Putin became prime minister, sparking his savage onslaught in Chechnya, also did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Many admirers of Nemtsov's articulacy, good looks and liberal reforms expected him to get the top job after Boris Yeltsin appointed him deputy prime minister in 1997.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>How different Russia might be today if Nemtsov had won the keys to the Kremlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Instead he is dead, testament to the darkness that has descended on his great nation under Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>'A few months ago, threats started coming in on social media, which prompted us to contact the law enforcement authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Last night, Ms Duritskaya's mother Inna told how the model called her from the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>'She was crying and saying that Boris had been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>I was shocked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>She confirmed that the model had had an abortion, saying: 'Yes, I knew about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Ms Duritskaya was pregnant in December 2013 and Mr Nemtsov paid for her to go to Switzerland for the termination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>In 1998, when Mr Putin headed the Russian security service the FSB, Mr Nemtsov was assaulted by a group of leather-jacketed thugs in a Moscow restaurant while dining with his wife Raisa and a Western correspondent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>He told his guests that the men were 'provocateurs' - but when police arrived, they ejected Mr Nemtsov and his wife from the restaurant and let the attackers go free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>As a young man, Mr Nemtsov was praised as a free-market reformer by Margaret Thatcher when she visited Nizhny Novgorod, an industrial town 260 miles from Moscow, where he was regional governor in the 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>He had been in a relationship with Ms Duritskaya for several years and the couple divided their time between Moscow and the Ukrainian capital, Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>A friend called Yulia said: 'They met three years ago and fell in love.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>It is believed that Mr Nemtsov remained married to Raisa, 56.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Last night, police claimed to have found the car used in the attack, amid reports that Ms Duritskaya had given them a clear description of the vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>It is thought to be a white Ford Focus or Mondeo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>The Kremlin said the Russian state had no reason to kill a figure who had lost much of his political influence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>'With all respect to Boris Nemtsov, he did not pose any threat in the political for the Russian authorities or for Vladimir Putin,' said a spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>'If we compare his popularity ratings with the government' Nemtsov was quite an average citizen.' Yet, the Kremlin condemned the murder as a 'provocation' and said Mr Putin had expressed condolences to Mr Nemtsov's family and friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko drew a link between the killing and the conflict in the east of his country between his government troops and pro-Russian separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>He claimed Mr Nemtsov had been killed because of his role as a 'bridge' between Moscow and Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Unlike many prominent Russian politicians, Mr Nemtsov did not employ bodyguards, even though he had predicted his own death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Earlier this month he said: 'I'm afraid Putin will kill me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>I believe he was the one who unleashed the war in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Hours before he was gunned down he said in a radio interview: 'The country needs political reform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Mr Nemtsov had four children with Raisa and two other partners, one of whom is Ekaterina Odintsova, 42, a former TV presenter and now editor-in-chief of OK!</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>magazine in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>She said: 'We loved him - he was an example for us.</td></tr>
