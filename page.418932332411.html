<h3>Turkey onslaught on Kurds, after Islamic State attack, fuels anger</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Musician Axin Bro, 36, talks to the Associated Press at a cafe in Diyarbakir, southeastern Turkey, Thursday, July 30, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We are used to this. Kurds have witnessed betrayal for centuries" says Bro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In Turkey's Kurdish heartland, the government's renewed military onslaught against the rebels has left many people crying treachery - with suspicions rife that Turkey used a brief offensive against IS as a cover to launch a broad attack against the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>DIYARBAKIR, Turkey - Just when it seemed Turkey was getting serious about the fight against the Islamic State group, it has turned its military focus to pounding its old foe: the Kurdish rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In Turkey's Kurdish heartland, the government's renewed military onslaught against the rebels has left many people crying treachery - with suspicions rife that Turkey used a brief offensive against Islamic State militants as a cover to open a broad attack against the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Many Kurds also are venting frustration against the United States, accusing Washington of turning a blind eye to Turkish attacks on the Kurds in exchange for logistical support on the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are used to this. Kurds have witnessed betrayal for centuries" said Axin Bro, a musician.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"National powers use us for their own ends."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The U.S. had welcomed Turkey's air assault last week on the Islamic State group, along with its decision to open air bases for American sorties, as a sign that Turkey had dropped its reluctance to fight the extremist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Since then, the jets taking off from this city in Kurdish-dominated lands have been hitting PKK targets in northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey, as the militant group has targeted military and police in Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Turkish jets again pounded PKK targets in northern Iraq in an operation Thursday that lasted 21/2 hours, a government official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said the latest air strikes were in retaliation for an attack on troops stationed near the border with Iraq earlier in the day that killed three soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government rules requiring prior authorization to speak to journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The U.S. has said Turkey has a right to defend itself against the PKK, which Washington, like Turkey, considers a terrorist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The PKK is affiliated with, but separate from, Syrian Kurdish fighters allied with the United States in its fight against the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Turkish officials say the Syrian Kurdish group is not a target of Turkey's operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Of the 1,300 people the government rounded up in a nationwide antiterror sweep, the overwhelming number has been Kurdish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That may reflect the PKK's greater presence in Turkish society, but Kurdish politicians charge that the government's objective is to curb the rising political power of the Kurds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Kurdish activists and government critics also believe the government's crackdown on the PKK is a tactic aimed at strengthening the ruling party ahead of possible new elections in November.</td></tr>
