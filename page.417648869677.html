<h3>Who's Who in music streaming: Apple, Spotify, Pandora & more</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple shook up the music world more than a decade ago when it offered an easy way to buy songs digitally for 99 cents each.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Now, it's trying to do it again with a subscription music streaming service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But this time, it faces heavy competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Several services charge $10 a month to let you play any of millions of tracks on mobile devices and even download them for offline listening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Once you stop paying, though, you lose all your songs, even ones you've already downloaded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Some offer free versions with ads and other restrictions, such as song selection only on PCs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>- With last year's purchase of headphones maker Beats, Apple got Beats Music, which offers unlimited listening and offline playback for $10 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That is evolving into Apple Music and will have a prominent spot on iPhones and other Apple devices, as well as a unique integration with Siri, Apple's voice-activated digital assistant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple Music, set to debut June 30, will also be $10 a month, after a three-month free trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The whole family can sign up for $15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>- Spotify is one of Apple Music's biggest competitors in this space, with 60 million active users worldwide, and a quarter of them paying subscribers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It also offers the ability to pick and play tracks on PCs for free with ads; on mobile devices, non-paying users can play albums, artists or playlists they want but with tracks in random order, also with ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>- Rhapsody, operating as Napster in some countries, offers unlimited music for $10, along with a hybrid service called "unRadio" for $5 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's basically ad-free Internet radio with the ability to save up to 25 favorites for playback anytime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>- Tidal and Deezer also offer high-fidelity CD-quality song streaming, which audiophiles tend to prefer over MP3s and other formats that reduce quality in the compression process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Tidal offers music video and curated playlists from experts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Both charge $10 a month for standard sound quality and $20 for high-fidelity, although discounts can reduce this price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>- Rdio offers full on-demand listening for $10, or a $4 hybrid service that allows 25 tracks to be picked and played on mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>- Besides the main on-demand features, Slacker's twist on a hybrid plan is a $4-per-month "Radio Plus" that allows for Internet radio stations to be listened to offline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>- Google Play Music service also offers unlimited on-demand listening for $10 a month, with no free option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Google also offers a service called YouTube Music Key for selected music videos, free of ads, for $10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Paying for one gets you the other, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>YouTube itself, which is free with ads, is possibly the world's favorite free option for music, whether you watch the video or not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>- Amazon offers on-demand unlimited listening with a $99-a-year Prime membership, though the song selection is very limited compared with rivals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>With Internet radio, which is free with ads, you can't choose songs or artists, as you can with the on-demand listening services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But you can fine-tune your Internet stations by specifying a song, artist, genre, playlist, mood, activity or time of day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The station will then stream songs to match your choices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>You can personalize stations further by skipping tracks or giving a thumbs up or down on the songs you hear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>- Pandora, the U.S. leader, has about 80 million active listeners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>It's free with ads, or you can pay $5 a month for an ad-free premium service and higher-quality audio over Web browsers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>- IHeart Radio combines genre-based Internet radio with online feeds of hundreds of traditional radio stations so homesick devotees can listen while out of market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>- Slacker's free offering intersperses playlists with pre-recorded intros and factoids by DJs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>- Songza offers a concierge Internet radio service based on the time of day and your activities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>- Internet radio through Apple's iTunes Radio is going away and will become part of the new Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The difference is humans rather than computers will choose the songs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It's free on Apple devices and Mac and Windows personal computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Apple is also launching a global radio station called Beats 1 to join stations based on genres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>DJs in Los Angeles, New York and London will host.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Pay per song enables you to buy songs or albums to own forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>- Apple's iTunes first made it easy to buy singles or albums, and that will continue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>But now, Google and Amazon compete in that space, often at lower prices and with different options to save your tunes online.</td></tr>
