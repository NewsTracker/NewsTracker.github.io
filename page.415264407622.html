<h3>Iraqi forces approach Tikrit as Islamic State destroys Nimrud</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Shiite fighters in Al Hadidiya, south of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Baghdad: As Iraq's largest offensive against Islamic State militants came a step closer to the city of Tikrit, archaelogists around the world warned that IS was attempting to destroy the priceless relics of a birthplace of civilisation after they took bulldozers to the capital of the biblical kingdom of Assyria, Nimrud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Shiite militiamen and Iraqi troops entered the town of Dour, just south of Tikrit, on Friday, according to Iraqi state television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Despite setbacks in some villages over the past four days,IS fighters have managed to hold on to Tikrit itself, using suicide attacks and roadside bombs to augment their defence against a pro-government force of at least 30,000, most of them from Iranian-backed Shiite militias.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The militias have played a crucial role in halting IS's march through Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A 2013 photograph of an ancient statue at the archaeological site of Nimrud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But their close ties to Iran, and allegations that they have killed Sunni civilians in revenge attacks after taking over some areas, have raised fears that the militias' counteroffensive into Iraq's Sunni heartland could worsen the sectarian strife that IS seeks to exploit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In Nimrud, IS fighters began looting and levelling the 3000-year-old site, the Iraqi government said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The city was one of the capitals of the Assyrian empire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Its statues, frescos and other works are revered around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was, until Thursday, the best preserved of all the Assyrian sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Daesh terrorist gangs continue to defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity," its antiquities ministry said, referring to IS by its Arabic acronym.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"In a new crime in their series of reckless offences they assaulted the ancient city of Nimrud and bulldozed it with heavy machinery, appropriating the archaeological attractions dating back 13 centuries BC."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The top cultural official at the United Nations called the latest destruction a war crime and vowed to do "whatever is needed" to stop the plundering by IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Nimrud destruction came a week after IS militants videotaped themselves marauding through Mosul's museum, using sledgehammers and torches to destroy statues, artefacts and books.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>IS leaders have sought to justify the cultural destruction by asserting that statues and other artefacts violate Islamic prohibitions on idol worship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But religious authorities have denounced the destruction as barbaric and anti-Islamic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Archaeologists and antiquities experts have also accused IS of selling many plundered artefacts, which suggests a cynical profiteering motive to the destruction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Abdulamir al-Hamdani, an Iraqi archaeologist who specialises in Mesopotamia at the department of anthropology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said Mosul residents had seen IS fighters removing artefacts to sell them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He expressed alarm that the next target could be the ruins of Hatra, south-west of Mosul, which is also within the area controlled by IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Hatra, thought to have been founded in the third or second century BC, became an important religious centre that was ruled by a succession of Arabian princes, and is one of several UNESCO World Heritage sites in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Nimrud, about 30 kilometres south of Mosul, was built about 1250 BC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Four centuries later it became capital of the neo-Assyrian empire - at the time the most powerful state on Earth, extending to modern-day Egypt, Turkey and Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Many of its treasures have been removed to museums over the years - its stunning gold jewellery to the national museum in Baghdad, some of its enormous statuary, including winged bulls with giant human heads, to the British Museum in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>However, much remains on site, including other statues and friezes unearthed in excavations in the 1950s and 1960s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Paul Collins, Ancient Near East curator at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, said archaeologists had been told by their local contacts that IS militants had arrived about midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>As yet, no pictures or videos have surfaced, so the extent of damage is not clear, but he said he feared the worst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Islamic State members came to the Nimrud archaeological city and looted the valuables in it and then they proceeded to level the site to the ground," a local tribal source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"There used to be statues and walls as well as a castle that Islamic State has destroyed completely."</td></tr>
