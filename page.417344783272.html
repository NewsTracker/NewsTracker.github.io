<h3>Why do Western women join Islamic State?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Why do Western women join Islamic State?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As ISIS recruiters prey on the gullible, the government's "hard" response toward the Muslim community isn't the right way to fight this "ideologiocal war", says senior Islamic leader Silma Ihram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>London: Western women in the Islamic State are playing a crucial role in disseminating propaganda and are not simply flocking to the region to become a "jihadi bride," according to a new British research report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The report published Thursday by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London called the view that women are joining the Islamic State primarily to marry a foreign fighter "one-dimensional."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Women are drawn to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, by a number of factors, including a sense of isolation, a feeling that the international Muslim community is under threat, and a promise of sisterhood, which was especially important for teenage girls, the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Much has been made of romantic notions in motivating people to go, but we know that reality is very different," Melanie Smith, one of the report's authors, said at a news conference in central London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The researchers said that about 550 Western women were living in the Islamic State, where their main responsibility is to be a good wife and mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Some women have expressed a desire to fight on the front lines, but it is not allowed under the Islamic State's interpretation of Sharia law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Western women are playing a significant role in propaganda and the recruitment of other women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"ISIS have allowed for, and even relied upon, a decentralised network of messengers to carry and promote their propaganda and proliferate their world-vision," the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The report highlighted the case of Salma and Zahra Halane - the teenage "terror twins" from Britain - who encourage women to migrate to the territory and avoid censorship by changing Internet usernames and "using 'shout-out' tactics" to keep their followers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They also answer questions from would-be migrants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Salma, for instance, advised a woman on Ask.fm that she should marry as soon as possible after she arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Smith, the researcher, said that the longest known period of a woman living unmarried in the Islamic State was two months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Women are also aware that their marriages may not last long, the report says, highlighting the case of "Shams," a Malaysian doctor who is prolific on social media and whose husband proposed on the first day they met.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Using social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Ask.fm, the researchers monitor about 100 women from 15 countries who they believe are living in Islamic State-controlled territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The majority are in their late teens and early 20s, with the youngest being 13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And though the researchers said marriage wasn't the only reason women were joining the Islamic State, it was still a factor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Online, images of a lion and lioness are shared frequently to symbolize this union. This is symbolic of finding a brave and strong husband, but also propagandises the notion that supporting a jihadist husband and taking on the ISIS ideology is empowering role for females," the report says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The report also highlighted discrepancies between the utopian society presented through Islamic State propaganda and the reality on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Women have been increasingly raising concerns, albeit indirectly, about issues including inadequate health care, shortages of electricity and clean water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Some were "considering climbing pine trees to gain Internet reception," the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>One woman reported having a miscarriage in the hospital after she was unable to communicate in a common language with her doctor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But such grumbles are the exception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The report said that the hashtag #nobodycaresaboutthewidow was "drowned out by overwhelmingly positive accounts and resultant propaganda."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The researchers also suggested ways to counter the recruitment of women to the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>They said that highlighting the reality of what life is really like - puncturing holes in the utopian propaganda - would help to deter young women from going.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>They also recommended boosting the number of female mentors and caseworkers working with vulnerable young women, noting that there is a lack of persuasive female voices reaching these women.</td></tr>
