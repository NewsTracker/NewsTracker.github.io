<h3>Sponsors say Blatter resignation one step in FIFA reform</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - For FIFA's top sponsors, the resignation of Sepp Blatter is just the first step in restoring the reputation of soccer's governing body and regaining the fans' trust following a corruption scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Blatter resigned as FIFA president Tuesday, amid pressure from colleagues, sponsors, athletes and fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The resignation came just days after he was re-elected to a fifth term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The soccer world was shaken last week after the U.S. issued indictments against 14 current or former soccer officials last week alleging corruption and fraud and the Swiss announced a criminal investigation into the votes awarding the World Cup tournaments to Russia in 2018 and to Qatar in 2022.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sponsors, including Coca-Cola and Visa, said they were examining their relationship with FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Those sponsors, who pour millions into supporting the World Cup and other FIFA tournaments, expressed relief Tuesday that the organization was taking positive action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Adidas, which has provided the official match ball for every World Cup since 1970, said in a statement that "today's news marks a step in the right direction on FIFA's path to establish and follow transparent compliance standards in everything they do."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Other sponsors echoed the sentiment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The allegations of corruption and questionable ethics within FIFA have overshadowed the game and taken away from the sport, players and fans," McDonald's said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We're hopeful that the changes being implemented within FIFA will be a big first step in positively reforming the organization."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Coca-Cola said Blatter's announcement is a "positive step for the good of sport, football and its fans."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Electronic Arts, which makes FIFA video games, said it is "supportive of FIFA's examination of its organization and the important steps being taken toward reform."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Blatter, who is not implicated in any of the charges, said he would step down in an acknowledgement that major change was needed at the top of FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>FIFA couldn't ignore the criticism, as the sponsors provide almost a third of its revenues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Recent figures showed the organization generated $5.7 billion in 2011-2014, which encompassed the Brazil World Cup, with sponsors and commercial partners contributing almost $1.6 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Visa reiterated Tuesday that it expects FIFA to take steps to "rebuild a culture with strong ethical practices."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The company had threatened to jump ship last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The negative sentiments likely played some part in Blatter's decision, said Manish Tripathi, assistant marketing professor at Emory University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The sponsors "make up such a large part of FIFA's revenues, and I am sure the last thing they wanted was the negative publicity of a drawn-out public fight between Sepp and the authorities," he said.</td></tr>
