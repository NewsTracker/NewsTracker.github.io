<h3>Fugitive ex-U.S. spy Snowden in talks on returning home: Lawyer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In Washington, U.S. officials said they would welcome Snowden's return to the United States but he would have to face criminal charges which have been filed against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Snowden's lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, who has links to the Kremlin, was speaking at a news conference to present a book he has written about his client.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Moscow granted Snowden asylum in 2013, straining already tense ties with Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I won't keep it secret that he... wants to return back home. And we are doing everything possible now to solve this issue. There is a group of U.S. lawyers, there is also a group of German lawyers and I'm dealing with it on the Russian side."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The United States wants Snowden to stand trial for leaking extensive secrets of electronic surveillance programmes by the National Security Agency (NSA).</td></tr>

<h3>Mundelein teen to be sentenced in stabbing death of sister</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The now 15-year-old pleaded guilty to first degree murder in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A Mundelein teenager who admitted to killing her younger sister in a rage because she felt unappreciated will remain in a juvenile detention facility until she turns 21, with a possibility of being released one year early by a parole board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The girl, who was 14 when she was accused more than a year ago of killing her 11-year-old sister, Dora Betancourt, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Now 15, the girl read a statement in Lake County juvenile court Tuesday saying she was grateful for the opportunity for the intensive counseling she is to receive in detention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She said she misses her sister and hopes her family can forgive her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>By pleading guilty Tuesday to the murder of her 11-year-old sister, a Mundelein teenager will be allowed to remain in the juvenile system with "intensive mental health services" - a deal that would not have been an option under Illinois law had she been a few months older.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I am truly sorry for the pain I've caused them," she said of her mother and former stepfather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The teen added that "I know that God forgives me" and that she will embrace her sister in heaven one day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I have had a lot of time to think and cry," said the teen, as a pastor and extended family waited outside the courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Tribune has not named the girl because she was charged as a juvenile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The teen, described as a "mini-mom" to her younger sister, recalled the things she and her sister used to do together, like watching movies, making bracelets and playing sports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Now I can only remember those times," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I can never get them back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>During the hearing, lawyers discussed the findings of two doctors who had evaluated the teen's mental health and agreed that she needed help to control her anger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Officials revealed that the teen had formerly been in counseling after waving a baseball bat at her mother at age 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She was forced to take on many adult responsibilities because her mother, a single parent, worked two jobs to support her daughters and save for private school, said the teen's lawyer, Michael Conway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Prosecutor Claudia Kasten said the teen admitted to stabbing Dora multiple times Jan. 22, 2014, because the younger sister "did not appreciate her."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Kasten read aloud the teen's two-page statement that she gave police, in which she said, "My mind was in another place and the devil was in me, and that is why my sister & is dead."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On Tuesday, Kasten said: "We know that the loss is great. This family is broken and shattered."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed to a deal that will have the teen remain in a juvenile facility until her 21st birthday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>After five years, her lawyers will be allowed to request her parole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Reading from her prepared statement, the teen said she plans to finish high school and pursue a career in nursing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I am also grateful because of the second chance I am getting," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I'll get out at 21 and start my life over. Not everyone gets that chance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>David Betancourt, Dora's father and the teen's former stepfather, gave a brief statement in court, saying: "It's been tough on all of us, losing Dora, losing (her sister). She wants to get help."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>After the hearing adjourned, the girls' grandfather, Jim Knauf, said: "I'm happy this is all over with. Dora's in heaven. She's in a good place. We're glad (her sister) will get help."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The court will monitor the teen's progress and access to mental health services every six months, said Judge Valerie Boettle Ceckowski.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Mental health experts for the defense and prosecution agreed that, if she receives such services, she should pose no threat to the community on her release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>After Tuesday's hearing, Lake County State's Attorney Michael Nerheim said he was initially "leaning" toward charging the teen as an adult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He changed his mind based on the girl's age, the medical reports and family history, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"It was a very difficult case," Nerheim said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"There's no easy answer, no perfect decision. We try to balance the interests of justice & and be sure she gets all the services she needs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The outcome would have been far different if the teen was 15 at the time of the murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Under a controversial Illinois law, juveniles 15 and older are automatically handled in adult court for several felony offenses, first-degree murder chief among them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Many juvenile justice experts, advocates and lawmakers have called for an end to the law, saying it has failed to enhance public safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Experts have said the law does not take into consideration a growing body of scientific research indicating the brains of teens are less developed than those of adults.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Supporters of a change in the law say a judge should have discretion to decide if older teen defendants should be tried in juvenile or adult court, based on factors like background and potential for rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The Mundelein girl initially told police an intruder killed her sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>She later confessed when her story didn't add up, prosecutors have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"What happened a little over a year ago & is not who she is," said her lawyer, Conway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"It was an aberration."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The judge on Tuesday encouraged the teen to "make a good life for yourself, a life that honors your sister, Dora, so that something good comes out of this unspeakable tragedy."</td></tr>
