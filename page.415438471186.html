<h3>Cyclone leaves trail of destruction</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cyclone Pam tore through the tiny South Pacific archipelago with winds of 270 kilometers (168 miles) per hour early on Saturday, leaving a trail of destruction and unconfirmed reports of dozens of deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Power remained out across Vanuatu throughout Saturday and people on many of the outer islands had no access to running water or outside communications, according to Chloe Morrison, a World Vision emergency communications officer in the capital Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ms Morrison said communications have been so problematic that her aid group has not yet been able to account for many of its own 76 staff on the islands and authorities have been unable to assess the extent of the damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I can say that for anybody who wasn't in a secure shelter last night, it would have been a very, very tough time for them," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 spread over 65 islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>About 47,000 people live in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ms Morrison said authorities did a good job of moving thousands of people in Port Vila into 23 evacuation centres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>With the winds and rain easing on Saturday, many people stepped out only to find that their homes were missing a roof or had disappeared, and were forced to return to the shelters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Teetering trees and downed power lines in Port Vila have made many areas hazardous, she said, adding that she had heard reports of entire villages being destroyed in more remote areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It's still really quite dangerous outside. Most people are still hunkering down," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Unicef estimated that 54,000 children were among those affected by the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the impact and scope of the disaster caused by the cyclone was not yet clear, but he feared the damage and destruction could be widespread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We hope the loss of life will be minimal," he said during the World Conference on Disaster Risk and Reduction in Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The UN said it was preparing to deploy emergency rapid response units.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, who was attending the conference, told participants: "I do not really know what impact the cyclone has had on Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I am speaking to you today with a heart that is so heavy. I stand to appeal on behalf of the government and the people to give a helping hand in this disaster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ms Morrison said the first priority was to ensure people had adequate food, drinking water and shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Beyond that, she said, there would need to be a long and concerted rebuilding effort in the months ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She said the winds peaked between about midnight on Friday and 1am on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A westward change of course put populated areas directly in the path of Cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said there were unconfirmed reports of 44 deaths in Vanuatu's northeastern islands after Pam moved off its expected track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>New Zealand has pledged one million New Zealand dollars ( 497,000) to help with relief efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Australia was preparing to send a crisis response team to Vanuatu if needed, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"There are destructive winds, rain, flooding, landslides, sea surges and very rough seas and the storm is exceedingly destructive there," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We are still assessing the situation, but we stand ready to assist."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The small island nation, located about a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii, has repeatedly warned it is already suffering devastating effects from climate change with the island's coastal areas being washed away, forcing resettlement to higher ground and smaller yields on traditional crops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Scientists say it is impossible to attribute single weather events like Cyclone Pam to climate change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The cyclone has already caused damage to other Pacific islands, including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Authorities in New Zealand are preparing for Cyclone Pam, which is forecast to pass north of the country on Sunday and Monday.</td></tr>

<h3>Australian Peter Nash pleads guilty in US to Silk Road role</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Los Angeles: In a dark, seedy, encrypted corner of the internet visited by drug addicts, traffickers and crime gangs, Australian prison employee Peter Nash was known by a number of aliases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>There's a good chance the 41-year-old from Brisbane will be known for much of the rest of his life by a serial number in the US federal prison system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nash entered a guilty plea in a Manhattan court on Friday to one count of narcotics conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He also faces up to 20 years' jail after admitting to one count of money laundering conspiracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I deeply regret my conduct and any consequent harm I caused," Nash told the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The former behavioural scientist at Queensland's Wacol Prison was one of the key players involved in Silk Road, a hidden, black market bazaar website where users could buy and sell heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and other drugs, fake passports and hire hitmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The site operated via a Tor network, a system of computers on the internet and distributed around the world designed to conceal the identities of the networks' users who used bitcoins as currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nash's guilty pleas came a month after Ross Ulbricht, the US mastermind behind Silk Road known as Dread Pirate Roberts, was convicted in a Manhattan court for narcotics trafficking and money laundering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prosecutors allege Silk Road was used by several thousand drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to well over a 100,000 buyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Nash, who admitted to earning $US30,000 from his role as the primary moderator on the site's chat room, told the court he used the money to buy drugs for his own personal use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nash will be sentenced on May 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ulbricht, 30, also faces life in jail when sentenced on May 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, praised the Australian Federal Police for their role in Nash's prosecution.</td></tr>
