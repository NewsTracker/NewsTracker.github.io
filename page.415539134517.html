<h3>Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst mistaken for murder suspect Robert Durst</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In an unfortunate mix-up, the Associated Press has confused Robert Durst, the property heir who once shot and dismembered a neighbour, with Fred Durst, the lead singer of nu-metal band Limp Bizkit, saying that Robert Durst belonged to the rock band and that he had been charged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Robert Durst, often described as a real estate heir, or property baron, was arrested by Louisiana state police on March 16 for possession of a firearm and controlled substance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On Saturday, he was charged with the murder of former friend and confidante Susan Berman in 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Renewed interest in Mr Robert Durst has come as a result as of a six-part documentary, The Jinx, on his life and crimes, alleged and proven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"NEW ORLEANS (AP) - A Louisiana State Police trooper says millionaire Robert Durst has been booked on weapons charges in that state - on top of a first-degree murder charge lodged by Los Angeles authorities. Trooper Melissa Matey told the Associated Press that an arrest warrant was issued for the former Limp Bizkit frontman and he was rebooked in the Orleans Parish Jail on Monday under two new charges," an AP report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The mistake, which was the second item in the AP's "California 10th NewsMinute" sent to users of the news organisation's state broadcast wire on March 16, was soon corrected in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The Associated Press reported erroneously that Robert Durst is a member of a band. He is a real estate heir; Fred Durst is the former frontman of Limp Bizkit," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Limp Bizkit, known for songs such as Nookie and Behind Blue Eyes, had its heydey in the early to mid 2000s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Fred Durst also acts in and produces independent movies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In contrast, the unconventional life of Robert Durst has recently captured the public imagination with the release of the documentary on his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>From one of New York's wealthiest and most powerful property owning families, Robert Durst has been continually under suspicion since his wife disappeared in 1982, suspected of her murder, allegations which have dogged him throughout his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In 2001, he shot and dismembered an elderly neighbour, Morris Black, dumping the body in Galveston Bay in Texas, while posing as a mute woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He was acquitted of murder but spent time in prison for other charges related to the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the final episode of the series, which aired in the United States on March 15, Robert Durst is recorded as saying, "What the hell did I do?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Durst is heard whispering when it appears he thought the microphone was off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Killed them all of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Partly as a result of this and ongoing investigations into the deaths, Robert Durst was charged with Susan Berman's murder in 2000, along with the separate weapons charges in Louisiana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Fred Durst in contrast, will be performing in Limp Bizkit's next concert in Mexico on March 24.</td></tr>
