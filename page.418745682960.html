<h3>FIFA asks Russia why it banned player for reaction to racism</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) FIFA has asked the Russian Football Union to explain why it banned a Ghanaian footballer for two matches for his reaction to fan racism and did not sanction the alleged abusers' team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In video from Friday's Russian Premier League game, Spartak Moscow fans could be heard racially taunting FC Ufa midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>Russia's second city on Saturday hosts the qualifying draw for the World Cup, which has increased the spotlight on the country's struggle eradicating racism from football matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''It is up to us as the organizers of this event to make sure this event is welcoming everyone, it is safe for everyone - not just for the players and participants but also for the fans,'' Addiechi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''It would be naive and first of all too arrogant for us to come here and say we are going to educate Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In December 2010, within hours of winning the FIFA vote to host its first World Cup, Russian leader Vladimir Putin said on football racism: ''We see it and we believe it is a problem.</td></tr>
