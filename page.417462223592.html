<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece says it has sent creditors a "comprehensive" and "realistic" package of reforms, as it races to reach a last minute debt deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is calling on Europe's leaders to accept the plan to end what he describes as "divisions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We have made concessions, because a compromise demands concessions," said Tsipras.</td></tr>
