<h3>World Briefing: Kenya: Thousands Attend Italian Nun?s Beatification</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tens of thousands of people gathered in the central town of Nyeri on Saturday to attend the beatification ceremony of an Italian nun, Sister Irene Stefani, who worked for many years in Kenya until her death in 1930 at the age of 39.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sister Stefani, who belonged to the Consolata Missionary Sisters, arrived in Kenya in 1915, according to a website dedicated to her beatification.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>During her time in Kenya she served as a Red Cross nurse and treated East African soldiers wounded during World War I. Decades later, a miracle was attributed to her: In Mozambique, about 270 people held captive in a church during that country's civil war prayed to her, and a small font produced enough water for all of them, according to a Kenyan newspaper, The Daily Nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A version of this brief appears in print on May 24, 2015, on page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Kenya: Thousands Attend Italian Nun's Beatification.</td></tr>
