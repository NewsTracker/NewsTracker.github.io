<h3>Clinton asks if nation wants to see a woman president</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>On the cusp of a second presidential campaign, the former secretary of state previewed some of the economic themes that could animate an upcoming race, pointing to an economy that too often fails to address the challenges faced by families and working mothers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We have to get our economy to reflect the realities of 21st century America, and we're not doing that," Clinton said at the 30th anniversary gala of EMILY's List, an organization that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We're not doing that when the hard work of men and women across our country is not rewarded with rising wages, but CEO pay goes up and up no matter what."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Clinton's 30-minute address was punctuated by references to her future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Looking out at the ballroom of female Democrats, Clinton asked if they were hopeful of seeing more women running for local offices like school board member, governor, mayor and member of Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I suppose it's only fair to say, 'Don't you someday want to see a woman president?'" she asked, generating loud applause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton steered clear of questions that emerged Tuesday about her use of a personal email account instead of a government-issued email address during her time as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Republicans seized on the disclosures, accusing her of violating a law intended to archive official government documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>GOP officials have also amplified reports that the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from foreign governments ahead of an expected Clinton campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It speaks volumes that Hillary Clinton will gladly attend fancy galas yet continue to hide from the American people," said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She said voters deserved to know "why she only used private email while serving as secretary of state at the same time the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from foreign governments who were lobbying her State Department."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In her speech, Clinton accused Republicans of fostering policies promoting "trickle-down economics" but noted that both parties have spoken of ways to boost wages for middle-class workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We welcome them to come with their ideas and we will match them," Clinton said of the Republicans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"That's what elections should be about. Elections should be a contest of ideas."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The prospect of a Clinton campaign was invoked repeatedly by political leaders who have worked with the fundraising powerhouse, whose name is an acronym for "Early money is like yeast."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The organization has a strong track record in Democratic politics, electing more than 100 women to the U.S. House, 19 to the Senate, 10 governors and more than 500 state and local officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"She's more than an idol," said Stephanie Schriock, EMILY's List's president, describing Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"She's an inspiration - and a leader whose talents we desperately need."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The event brought to the stage Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, the group's first endorsed candidate who recently announced her retirement, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California and former Arizona Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Gabrielle Giffords, who was gravely wounded in a deadly 2011 shooting during a political event at a Tucson, Arizona, shopping mall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Giffords said female leaders deliver results, in places like city hall, state houses, governor's mansions and Congress, "and maybe soon, in the White House."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The organization has helped lay the groundwork for a potential Clinton campaign, holding events to promote the possibility of electing the nation's first female president and commissioning polling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Ellen Malcolm, the founder of EMILY's List, pointed to Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign as the first step, bringing the audience to their feet when she identified 2016 as the "time to shatter that glass ceiling and put a woman in the White House."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Clinton, seated in the audience, laughed and clapped along with the crowd.</td></tr>

<h3>Door may open for Brian Williams if former NBC News exec Andrew Lack returns</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Embattled NBC News anchor Brian Williams has a potential lifeline in Andrew Lack's expected return to NBC News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lack is in advanced negotiations to take the top news post at the network, where he worked from 1993 to 2001, according to NBC executives not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He would replace current NBCUniversal News Group Chairman Pat Fili-Krushel, who is set to take another corporate role, the executives said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Several TV news executives who worked under Andrew Lack's previous tenure at the network say Lack's becoming the new head of the news group provides a path for Brian Williams to return from his six-month suspension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Several TV news executives who worked under Lack's previous tenure at the network say Lack's becoming the new head of the news group provides a path for Williams to return from his six-month suspension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Lack was responsible for grooming Williams to take over the anchor chair on "NBC Nightly News" from Tom Brokaw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"While it's not a guarantee, it certainly indicates that he is coming back," said one of those former executives who asked not to be quoted by name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Five other veterans of NBC News with former ties to Lack and Williams agreed with that assessment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They are great friends," said another former colleague of both men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Brian Williams thanks Andy for getting the chair."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Williams' successful 10-year run on "NBC Nightly News" came to an abrupt halt Feb. 7 when he stepped away amid the controversy over his false statements regarding his 2003 reporting during the U.S. invasion of Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Feb. 11, he was suspended while NBC News conducts an internal review to determine whether there have been other discrepancies in his reporting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Lack advised NBC News during the discussions on the anchor's future, according to several network executives familiar with the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He was among the people NBC Universal Chief Executive Steve Burke reached out to when deciding how to handle the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Thanks to his highly successful run when he was NBC News president, Lack has the respect within the organization needed to get support for a Williams rehabilitation effort, said another former executive who has worked closely with the two in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"He can say 'Brian has served his time and we know he was wrong - I've known this guy as long as anybody and I have 100% faith in him that it won't happen again,'" the former executive said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>David Westin, who as a top executive at ABC News spent years competing against Lack, believes he is capable of restoring the luster to a news division that has been embroiled in turmoil since Fili-Krushel took over in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"He did a terrific job at NBC the first time around, and I'm sure he'll do it again," Westin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But Westin added he believes any action that Lack takes on Williams won't be based on friendship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"There are strong reasons why it made sense for Steve Burke to leave the door open for Brian's return," Westin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"But Andy will make the right decision for NBC News on the merits, not because of any personal relationship with anyone. That's what those jobs require."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The situation with Williams has been part of a steady stream of events that have depicted NBC News as a chaotic organization unable to regain its footing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>NBC News hired one-time ESPN programming whiz Jamie Horowitz to help turn around its "Today," only to fire him less than three months later after sweeping changes he proposed for the second-place morning program had been leaked to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>David Gregory was unseated from his moderator role at "Meet the Press" after the company publicly stated support for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Gregory's successor, Chuck Todd - chosen after NBC News President Deborah Turness approached comedian Jon Stewart about taking the job - has only delivered minor improvements to the ratings on the program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>While the return of Lack, who had top executive stints at Bloomberg Media and Sony Music, brings valuable institutional knowledge to NBC News, there is still the question of whether he can lead the division into the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Turness, who was Fili-Krushel's hire, was brought in with a mandate to prepare the news division for TV's changing digital landscape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>That strategy may not matter at this moment, according to one NBC News insider who said, "How can you get to the future if you can't handle today?"</td></tr>
