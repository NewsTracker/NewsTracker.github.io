<h3>Islamic State fighters suspected of using chlorine gas in Iraq</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Islamic State fighters traded sniper fire and mortar rounds with Iraqi troops and allied Shi'ite militia forces on Sunday in the city of Tikrit amid further reports the militants had obtained chlorine for possible use as a chemical weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A military official returned from the front in Tikrit said no major advances were made by either side nearly two weeks into an operation to win back the city IS fighters seized last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Iraqi Kurdish authorities said on Saturday they had proof the radical Islamist militants occupying large parts of the country's north and west used chlorine against Kurdish peshmerga fighters in January in a car bombing attempt west of the city of Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Baghdad government has not issued a statement on the semi-autonomous Kurdish region's announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the mayor of a town on the northern edge of Tikrit told Reuters on Sunday that storage containers filled with chlorine were found by troops when they entered al-Alam last week, the day before they fought their way into Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We found a number of storage units containing chlorine that we think were seized by [the Islamic State] from water purification stations in different parts of Tikrit," Laith al-Jubouri said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said security forces had sealed off the area where the containers were found and alerted Baghdad authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He also said the security forces had found bombs containing chlorine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On Tuesday, when Iraqi forces and allied mainly-Shi'ite militias pushed IS fighters out of the town, a Reuters photographer was present when Iraqi police instructed journalists to stand back and hold their breath as they detonated a roadside bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>When they detonated the bomb, a yellowish plume burst into the air, and as bystanders coughed, officials shouted, "Be careful, it's chlorine!" the Reuters photographer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The statement from Kurdish authorities about Islamic State's use of chlorine referred to footage of "similar attacks" during the recent fighting around Tikrit, though the mayor and another security official only noted the presence of chlorine found in areas recently seized back from IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The military campaign to retake Tikrit has been stalled since Friday, when security officials said Iraqi forces and their militia allies would wait for reinforcements before moving forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Two days later, back-up had not yet arrived, and officials continued to stress the challenges they faced in flushing out militants in street-by-street battles and defusing bombs and booby traps they laid while retreating from parts of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"There were no new pushes today from either side, only scattered skirmishes in the northern and southern parts of the city," Colonel Mohammed Abid al-Jubouri told Reuters by phone after visiting the southern edge of Tikrit on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr. Jubouri said the process of "organizing troops and waiting for reinforcements" was ongoing and did not say when a fresh effort to seize the central districts of the city still held by IS would begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The militants still hold about half the city, which lies about 160 km north of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Most residents of Tikrit fled in the months after the extremists overran the city in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Fabio Forgione, Head of Mission for Doctors without Borders, said his organization was concerned about the "huge number of civilians" in areas north of Tikrit where fighting could shift after the current offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The effort to retake Saddam Hussein's home city from the militants has been the biggest offensive yet against the group that has declared an Islamic caliphate on territory it controls in Iraq and neighboring Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>To the southeast near the Shi'ite city of Samarra, a suicide bomber drove a car into a group of Shi'ite militiamen, killing three of them, police and medical sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The militia groups have been using Samarra as a rear base for the Tikrit offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Atrocities committed by Islamic State continue to surface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>More than 50 corpses were found on Sunday near the mainly Shi'ite Turkman town of Bashir near Kirkuk in northern Iraq, said Kamil Amin, spokesman for Iraq's Human Rights ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He said experts from the Human Rights and Health Ministries also visited three mass graves recently found near the village of Abu Ajeel, east of Tikrit, on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The experts took one corpse as sample to do analysis to determine whether they were the victims of a massacre of Iraqi soldiers of unprecedented scale at Camp Speicher in June.</td></tr>

<h3>Manly confirm Foran exit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Foran told his Sea Eagles teammates on Monday morning he was following halfback Daly Cherry-Evans out of the exit door at the end of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But the 24-year-old said linking up again with former Manly assistant Arthur was the biggest reason for swapping Sydney's northern beaches for the western suburbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"There's no hiding from the fact that played a part," Foran told the Nine Network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"He's someone I really respect and have a whole lot of time for. But more importantly enjoyed playing under and working with in that 2013 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I guess when he rang me and asked me about the opportunity of going there I took it as a good one."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Foran denied his decision was an insult to Sea Eagles coach Geoff Toovey and said it was difficult breaking the news to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I have the utmost respect for 'Tooves'," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It was hard, I could see the disappointment and hurt in his face. He is someone I have a lot of time for."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The five-eighth also admitted feeling under huge pressure to stay after Cherry-Evans announced he was on his way to the Gold Coast knowing what a blow it would be for the club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I guess it did, I didn't want to see Manly lose both of us," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"That is why I was wrestling with my decision up until this morning."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Parramatta chairman Steve Sharp hailed the signing of Foran as a great day for the club and a sign the Eels are on their way to returning as a major force in the NRL - less than two years after claiming a second successive wooden spoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Sharp, who threatened to resign two years ago unless Arthur was given the job over Jason Taylor, said the influence of the coach is transforming the club after more than a decade of mediocrity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It's a great day for our club when a player of Kieran's ability decides to join us," Sharp told AAP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"He is already a fantastic player and under Brad Arthur's coaching he will become an even better player than he is now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Brad's created an environment here where the players want to play for him and I think this signing is evidence of that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The club is in a good place and it smells like a football club again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>News of Foran's exit was a bitter blow for the Sea Eagles, for so long the plunderers of other club's talent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Manly CEO Joe Kelly, who joined from South Sydney where he'd served as chief financial officer, last October, had made keeping Foran and Cherry-Evans his biggest goal when he was appointed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He now finds himself having to turn to a shortlist of potential replacements in addition to finding a major sponsor with Kaspersky set to cut ties at the end of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But he vowed to splash the cash to keep the club successful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The club is now in a position of having the resources necessary to recruit some of the best talent in the marketplace, to ensure the Sea Eagles remain a dominant team in the NRL," Kelly said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We've an extremely bright future here at Manly.</td></tr>
