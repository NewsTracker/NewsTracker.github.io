<h3>Hillary Clinton to make first South Carolina trip on May 27, campaign says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATLANTA - The campaign for Hillary Rodham Clinton says the Democratic presidential candidate plans to be in the early voting state of South Carolina on May 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It will be her first trip to the state since announcing her second White House bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The campaign did not disclose details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>South Carolina, which hosts the South's first 2016 primary, is important for Democrats because it is the contest with a large number of black voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the 2008 campaign, Clinton initially led then-Sen. Barack Obama in early South Carolina polls, but many African-Americans shifted their support to Obama once he won Iowa, and Obama went on to defeat Clinton 55 percent to 27 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton already has campaigned in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the nominating contest.</td></tr>
