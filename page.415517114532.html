<h3>16 million Americans gained health coverage under Obamacare, HHS says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The report issued Monday was based in part on findings from a Gallup poll, which found the uninsured rate for Americans had fallen from 20.3 percent in October 2013 - when the sign-ups began - to 12.3 percent during the first quarter of 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The increases come from sign-ups through the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) almost five years ago, about 16.4 million uninsured people have gained health coverage - the largest reduction in the uninsured in four decades," HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said in a written statement accompanying a new report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Remember when conservatives claimed that Obamacare was increasing the number of uninsured?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The increase of insured Americans represents a 35 percent reduction in the number of uninsured, leaving 26 million American adults without health insurance compared to the previous number of approximately 40 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The greatest changes in coverage gains were among Latinos and African-Americans, according to a Gallup-Healthways Well-Being index survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For Latinos, the uninsured rate was 41.8 percent before Obamacare was launched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>By the first quarter of 2015, that number dropped by just over 12 percent, leaving 29.5 million without insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For African-Americans, 22.4 percent were without insurance by the first quarter in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That percentage was almost cut in half by the first quarter of 2015, leaving 13.2 percent of African-Americans without health insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Wow. 16.4 million Americans have been insured under Obamacare http://t.co/brlXLJfdb0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Largest drop in uninsured in 4 decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>White Americans, meanwhile, saw a 5.3 percentage point reduction in their uninsured rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Just 9 percent remain without health coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The overall decline comes from government-run marketplaces that sell health insurance, the loosening of Medicaid eligibility requirements in more than half the country and allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health plans until they turn 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"When it comes to the metrics of affordability, access and quality, the evidence shows that the Affordable Care Act is working, and families, businesses and taxpayers are better off as a result," said Burwell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There are 28 states and Washington, DC that have expanded their Medicaid programs, and another 22 states kept their stricter restrictions on Medicaid eligibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The goal of Obamacare was to reduce the number of uninsured Americans and the latest figures suggest growing progress towards the goal, but this achievement could be threatened by a lawsuit being heard by the US Supreme Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The lawsuit, King v.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Burwell, centers on whether federal subsidies in 34 states that have not set up their own health insurance markets ("exchanges") are legal under the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The plaintiffs argue a particular section of the law refers only to "exchanges established by the state" when mentioning eligibility for subsidies - meaning it explicitly excludes marketplaces established by the federal government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The government is arguing that the phrasing may be unfortunate, but that the entire law clearly intends that the federal tax credits apply to people using the federally established exchange, not just the state ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>If the Supreme Court rules against the government, that would mean the end of federal subsidies to more than seven million Americans in 37 states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>This, in turn, would disrupt the fragile framework of the law that orders Americans to purchase insurance or face tax penalties, while forbidding the insurers to turn anyone away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Insurance companies, Democratic lawmakers and liberal activists argue this would effectively destroy the ACA.</td></tr>

<h3>Homegrown gourmet pot on the rise in Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But in the new world of legal markets and gourmet weed, aficionados here are looking to the United States and Europe for the good stuff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Instead of Acapulco Gold, Mexican smokers want strains like Liberty Haze and Moby Dick - either importing high-potency boutique pot from the United States, or growing it here in secret gardens that use techniques perfected abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's a small but growing market in a country where marijuana is largely illegal, unlike the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington that have legalized recreational use, and others where medicinal pot is available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A text message will bring a Mexico City dealer to the customer's doorstep with a menu of high-end buds for sale at the swipe of a credit card through a smartphone reader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hydroponic shops have sprung up that supply equipment to those who want to cultivate potent strains in sophisticated homegrown operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Some even are setting up pot cooperatives to share costs like high electrical bills and swap what they grow with each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I know people who are architects, executives, lawyers & who went to the United States or Europe," said Antoine Robbe, the 35-year-old, French-born proprietor of Hydrocultivos, one of the shops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>So far, reports of U.S.-grown marijuana making its way south have been only anecdotal but enough to raise concern, according to Alejandro Mohar, a Mexican physician and member of the U.N. International Narcotics Control Board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration official told NPR news in December that Mexican cartel operatives were smuggling in high-end U.S. marijuana to sell to wealthy customers, though there's no sign so far of a massive southward trade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The DEA declined to comment further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In Mexico City, several people said they have seen freezer-size bags of marijuana labeled as being for medicinal use in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mexico allows people to carry up to 5 grams of pot for personal use, but bans selling and growing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Historically, there has been little social tolerance for pot use, with "marijuanos" stigmatized as slackers or supporters of the deadly drug trade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mexico growers say the home-cultivation phenomenon is removed from the grisly "narco-wars" that have wracked the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In fact, growing and swapping among themselves, they contend, allows them to avoid supporting the cartels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I'm not a narco, dude. I just like to smoke," said Daniel, a goateed 32-year-old living in the bohemian Roma neighborhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He spoke on condition that his last name not be used because, he said, his home-grow operation is "super-illegal" despite being for personal use only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mexican law provides for prison sentences of up to 25 years for people convicted of producing, trafficking or selling drugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Home growers say they are forming cooperatives to share the costs of indoor gardening gear and high power bills, and swap harvests with each other, with many building their club model with skills first imported by foreigners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Last year, Homero Fernandez, a 29-year-old event promoter, teamed up with about a dozen people to form a pot club, each paying about $200 to buy a hydroponic growing kit now tended to by one of the members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Today the club has about 50 to 60 plants that produce enough sativa buds to satisfy the members, some of them heavy smokers, who are able to purchase an ounce of high-end pot for between $95 and $130, less than half of what they'd pay a dealer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The end result is pot with around 15 to 20 percent THC, the high-generating component of marijuana, compared to 3 to 8 percent in the Mexican "brick weed" more commonly sold here and north of the border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Some people are also producing concentrates with 60 to 99.6 percent THC, the strongest of which are too powerful to be smoked in a pipe or joint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"It comes out much cheaper than paying for even regular pot & and the quality is much higher," said Fernandez, who wore his Ray-Ban shades indoors and sported a white T-shirt emblazoned with the letters "THC."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"What gets produced is exclusively for us. Nothing more, and it doesn't get sold outside (the club)."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The market for gourmet weed is still minuscule next to the multibillion-dollar marijuana export trade dominated by the cartels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>According to DEA statistics, seizures along the border last year accounted for more than 2.2 million pounds (1 million kilograms) of pot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The hydroponic shops don't sell seeds or pot and thus stay on the right side of the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Like others, Daniel ordered seeds online from a company in Spain, opting for a U.K.-originated strain known as Exodus Cheese.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The precious cargo arrived by mail nine days later in envelopes resembling tea bags inside a tiny, discreetly labeled tin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Just as seeds increasingly are crossing borders, Fernandez said, wider acceptance abroad is reshaping attitudes in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"The United States, with this boom of regularization and this boom of legal marijuana, all that arrives here and has an impact on cannabis culture.</td></tr>
