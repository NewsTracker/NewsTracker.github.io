<h3>Kenya says Islamic extremists kill 14 in Kenya's north</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - At least 14 people were killed in an attack early Tuesday in the country's north by al-Shabab, Islamic extremist rebels from neighboring Somalia, a Kenyan official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Eleven people were also wounded in the attack which took place in Soko Mbuzi village in Mandera County near Kenya's border with Somalia, said Mandera County Commissioner Alex Nkoyo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Somali-based militants, who are allied to al-Qaida, have killed at least 85 people, all of them non-Muslims, in Mandera County in the last eight months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Al-Shabab has vowed to carry out attacks in Kenya as retribution for the country sending troops to Somalia to fight the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kenya sent its troops to Somalia in October 2011 following a series of cross-border attacks including kidnappings which the government blamed on al-Shabab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Somali government, supported by the U.N. and backed by troops from African Union countries including Kenya, has pushed al-Shabab out of Somalia's major cities but the rebels still control some rural areas and carry out bombings and attacks on the capital, Mogadishu, and attacks on Kenyan targets.</td></tr>
