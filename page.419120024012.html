<h3>F1 driver and wife gassed, robbed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(CNN)Formula One driver Jenson Button's wife Jessica had her engagement ring stolen when thieves broke into a rented house in France -- in a burglary that a spokesman for Button suggested might have involved the use of gas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The British McLaren Honda driver, his wife and friends were vacationing in a rented villa in Saint Tropez, on the French Riviera, when two men broke in on Monday night while they all slept, said spokesman James Williamson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The thieves "stole a number of items of jewellery including, most upsettingly, Jessica's engagement ring," he said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The police have indicated that this has become a growing problem in the region with perpetrators going so far as to gas their proposed victims through the air conditioning units before breaking in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Whilst unharmed, everyone involved is unsurprisingly shaken by the events."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Police in Saint Tropez declined to comment on the reported theft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Button, who lives in Monaco, has enjoyed a 15-year career as a Formula One driver and was 2009 world champion.</td></tr>
