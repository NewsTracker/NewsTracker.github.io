<h3>Kenya bombed two al Shabaab camps in Somalia on Sunday - military source</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NAIROBI, April 6 (Reuters) - The Kenyan air force bombed two al Shabaab camps in Somalia on Sunday, a Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) source said, in the first major military response to last week's attack by the militant group on a Kenyan university.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jets pounded the camps in Gondodowe and Ismail, both in the Gedo region bordering Kenya, the military source said on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Cloud cover made it difficult to establish how much damage the bombings caused or estimate the death toll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We targeted the two areas because according to information we have, those (al Shabaab) fellows are coming from there to attack Kenya," he said, in reference to Thursday's massacre at Garissa University College, some 200km (120 miles) from the Somali border.</td></tr>
