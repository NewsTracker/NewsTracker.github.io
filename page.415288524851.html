<h3>Beleaguered Hadi says Aden Yemen 'capital'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But tensions were running high in Aden, as special forces suspected of links to the militia known as Huthis readied defences against an anticipated assault by Hadi loyalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Aden became the capital of Yemen as soon as the Huthis occupied Sanaa," the aide quoted Hadi as saying in reference to their takeover of Sanaa several months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Several Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, have already moved their embassies to Aden after an exodus of foreign diplomats from Sanaa in February over security concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the United States, the first to close its mission in Sanaa, has said it will not do so, although it continues to back Hadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hadi also accused ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh and the Huthis of links with Iran, and spoke of his escape from Sanaa and Huthi demands to integrate thousands of their militants into the army and police and secure top government posts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His remarks about Aden reflect his determination to hold out against Huthi efforts to extend their influence, but are purely symbolic because moving the capital requires a change to the constitution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Outgoing defence minister General Mahmud al-Subaihi also managed to flee from Sanaa to Aden on Saturday, a source close to him told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"After realising he had disappeared from Sanaa, the Huthis broke into his house and searched it," said another source in his entourage, confirming his flight from the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Subaihi was part of the government of prime minister Khalid Bahah, who resigned in January after the Huthis seized the presidential palace and key government buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Huthis had named Subaihi to chair their new security commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The special forces commander in Aden, Abdel Hafez al-Saqqaf, has defied a decree by Hadi sacking him and said he will only follow orders from the presidential council in Sanaa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His men have cut roads leading to their headquarters near Aden's international airport and set up barricades, saying they fear an assault by the Popular Resistance Committees, loyal to Hadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Aden, the country's second largest city, was capital of a once-independent south Yemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Huthis named a "presidential council" after Hadi and Bahah tendered their resignations in January in protest at what critics branded an attempted coup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>After fleeing house arrest in Sanaa, Hadi resurfaced in Aden where he retracted his resignation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Bahah remains trapped in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On Saturday, Hadi said he escaped his Sanaa residence through a tunnel linking it to the nearby house of one of his sons and travelled to Aden using back roads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Huthis overran Sanaa in September and have since exerted their influence over several other areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Shiite militia has long complained of marginalisation and fought the government between 2004 and February 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Huthis oppose a plan for a six-region federation, which Hadi hopes to implement, saying it would divide Yemen into rich and poor areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Hadi said Saturday the Huthis had demanded 135 top government jobs and the vice presidency for one of their leaders, Saleh al-Sammad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They also demanded that 35,000 militiamen be integrated into the armed forces and 25,000 into the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Hadi accused Iran of links with the Huthis, saying 1,600 militia members are being trained in religious schools in the holy Iranian city of Qom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He also accused Saleh, the veteran ex-president who was forced from power in 2012, of having urged Iran to persuade the Huthis to collaborate with him before they seized Sanaa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Gulf Cooperation Council, which continues to support Hadi, is ruled by Sunni Muslim regimes deeply suspicious of the Huthis, fearing they will take Yemen into Shiite Iran's orbit.</td></tr>

<h3>Ukraine rebels insist heavy weapons withdrawn from front line</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Snizhne: Pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine claim to have fulfilled their end of a February deal with government forces to withdraw heavy weapons from the front line as part of a ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Today is the last day of the weapons withdrawal," Eduard Basurin, one of the rebel leaders, told reporters in the town of Snizhne on Saturday, where the separatists displayed eight 120mm mortars that had been moved back from their positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Watched by six international monitors, who declined requests for comment, the separatists towed the arms to a disused brick factory serving as an arms depot, about 90 kilometres from the rebel hub of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A battered Ukrainian army helmet in Yenakievo, Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rebels claim they have withdrawn heavy weapons from the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Basurin said the separatists were withdrawing a total of 26 mortars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They will be stored with the rest of the military hardware," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Four other artillery pieces were seen inside the Snizhne depot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A pro-Russian rebel cleans equipment at the weekend near the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Under the terms of the European-brokered, Russian-backed truce, signed in the Belarussian capital, Minsk, on February 12, both sides to Ukraine's 11-month conflict must move their artillery back far enough to create a buffer zone of between 50 kilometres and 140 kilometres, depending on the weapons' range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The process has been fraught with distrust and mutual recriminations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Both parties have accused the other of merely paying lip service to the peace deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Alexander Zakharchenko, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, accused Ukraine's government of failing to live up to its side of the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A trench near the front line in Horlivka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We have fully removed heavy weapons from the line of contact. Ukraine has not yet done it," he told the separatist news agency DAN, threatening to redeploy the arms if Kiev did not match the de-escalation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ukrainian army spokesman Anatoliy Stelmakh said the government was upholding its end of the bargain, saying the army was continuing to withdraw its 220mm Uragan rocket launchers from the conflict zone, after earlier pulling back its smaller Grad multiple rocket systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The process is ongoing," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The end of the nearly daily deluge of shelling and rocketing, which has killed more than 6000 people in eastern Ukraine since April 2014, would be a coup for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, architects of the Russian-backed ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is monitoring the truce, has recorded arms movements on both sides over the past two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>However, it said it was being denied access to the information it needed to confirm weapons were being put beyond use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>After a blood-soaked start to the truce - as the rebels fought on to seize the transport hub of Debaltseve - eastern Ukraine regained a measure of peace in the past two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Beyond the heavy weapons, the deal also calls for the withdrawal "of all foreign-armed formations" and military equipment from Ukrainian territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The accord also commits Kiev and the rebels to exchange all prisoners and to negotiate a change to Ukraine's constitution by the end of 2015, in order to give rebel-held areas more autonomy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>On Saturday, they again traded accusations of violating the ceasefire in the past 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But there was good news in Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"For the first time over the past few months" no Ukrainian soldier was killed or injured by rebel fire, a military spokesman said.</td></tr>
