<h3>Warriors erase 20-point hole, beat Pelicans 123-119 in OT (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Stephen Curry scored 40 points, including a 3-pointer in the final seconds of regulation to complete a 20-point, fourth-quarter comeback, and the Golden State Warriors beat New Orleans 123-119 in overtime Thursday night to take a 3-0 lead in their first-round playoff series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Curry hit seven 3s in all, including one to start overtime that gave the Warriors the lead for good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Klay Thompson had 28 points for the Warriors, who trailed 89-69 after three quarters, then outscored New Orleans 39-19 over the next 12 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Anthony Davis had 29 points and 15 rebounds for the Pelicans, but his missed free throw with 9.6 seconds left - as the crowd chanted ''M-V-P!'' - allowed Curry's late 3 to tie it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Curry missed a 3-point attempt in the final seconds of regulation, but Marreese Speights corralled the rebound and handed it to Curry in the corner, and the Warriors' leader wasn't going to miss twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Davis had a chance to tie it in the final seconds of overtime, but Warriors center Andrew Bogut forced him into a difficult driving shot, which missed badly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ryan Anderson, who had hit only two of 11 shots through the first two games of the series, responded with 26 points in Game 3, making 10 of 14 shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His second 3-pointer with 1:11 left in overtime pulled the Pelicans to 119-118.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Soon after, the Pelicans had a chance to take the lead, but Eric Gordon's attempt to surprise the Warriors with a quick 3 backfired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Curry's free throws made it 121-118, but the Pelicans were able to trim the lead with a free throw and keep the ball because of a foul away from the ball by Thompson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Davis made the free throw, but he couldn't convert the field goal needed to tie it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Draymond Green had 12 points and 17 rebounds for Golden State, which finished with 22 offensive rebounds and 30 second-chance points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Shaun Livingston had 12 points and Harrison Barnes added 11 for Golden State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Tyreke Evans had 19 points and Norris Cole added 16 for New Orleans, which lost despite outshooting the Warriors 51.1 percent (46 of 90) to 41.1 percent (42 of 104).</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Pelicans, who went 28-13 at home during the regular season, withstood a strong start by Golden State and then used a stunning 19-0 run to open a double-digit lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Davis started the surge with a putback dunk and Cole scored seven points during the run, including a 3 and reverse layup, the latter putting the Pelicans up 39-25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>New Orleans led by as many as 16 points in the quarter before Golden State trimmed it to 63-52 at halftime, thanks in part to Thompson's fifth 3 of the half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Warriors: F David Lee missed his third straight game, but coach Steve Kerr said he was ''doing better'' and expected to do some 3-on-3 work during practice on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>... Green fouled out late in overtime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Pelicans: Quincy Pondexter received a technical foul in the third quarter for arguing with officials after he was called for blocking on Curry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>... New Orleans shot 59.6 percent (28 of 47) in the first half, including 5 of 11 from 3-point range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Warriors made their first five 3-point attempts, with Thompson hitting three and Curry two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>They then missed their next 10 attempts from long range before finishing 14 of 41 (34.1 percent) from beyond the arc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>New Orleans made 13 of its first 18 shots in the second quarter, but only 7 of 19 shots in the fourth quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Pelicans reserves outscored Golden State's 58-26, largely because of the production by Anderson and Cole, as well as Jrue Holiday, who had 10 points.</td></tr>
