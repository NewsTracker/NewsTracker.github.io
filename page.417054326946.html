<h3>Islamic State tightens grip on Ramadi</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Irbil: The Islamic State group has consolidated its control over Ramadi, the capital of Iraq's largest province, whose capture by the militants was the worst defeat for the Iraqi government since the fall of Mosul nearly a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Iraqi officials and local officials said Islamic State fighters were combing through neighbourhoods in search of government employees and pro-government tribal fighters, and were conducting public executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The IS consolidation comes after US special operations forces killed senior Islamic State leader Abu Sayyaf in a raid in Syria, US officials said on Saturday, an operation that appeared to mark a departure from Washington's strategy of relying mostly on a bombing campaign to target militant leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>President Barack Obama ordered the overnight operation that killed Sayyaf, identified as an Islamic State commander who helped manage the group's black-market sales of oil and gas to raise funds, according to US officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His wife, Umm Sayyaf, was captured and was being held in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In Iraq, the mayor of Ramadi, Mohammed Kubaisi, said Islamic State fighters had burned most of the government buildings they captured on Friday and then withdrew "out of fear of the American planes, which would easily be able to target government facilities".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But he said the withdrawal was simply a repositioning to safer locations and that the group controlled virtually all of Ramadi, a city with an estimated 500,000 inhabitants that until Friday was one of the last government-held areas in Anbar province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Islamic State had besieged the city since January 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It finally overwhelmed government positions in an attack that began on Thursday night with a series of suicide car bombings that forced Iraqi police and security forces to abandon their positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In response to the blitz, which included armoured bulldozers that cleared away government defensive barriers, the US is rushing new shipments of shoulder-fired rockets to Iraq that a White House statement said would be especially useful against armoured car bombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Daesh fighters have blocked anyone from leaving the area and are searching for government soldiers and tribesmen that have opposed them," said a resident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"They're executing people in the streets, I have seen at least 20 myself and there are no government forces left in the main sections of the city. We have been abandoned to Daesh."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Brigadier General Saad Maan Ibrahim, an Iraqi military spokesman, told Iraqi state television that the US-led coalition had been supporting Iraqi troops with "painful" airstrikes since late on Friday and that three regiments of Iraqi troops had been deployed to help retake the city, although witnesses throughout the area said those troops had yet to arrive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Iraqs flee Islamic State militants who have taken control in Ramadi.</td></tr>
