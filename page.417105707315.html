<h3>Morocco's Islamic women preachers lead social revolution</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CASABLANCA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Girls are "like a timebomb ready to explode and ruin the family's reputation", the Moroccan jewelry trader tells his customer as she admires a display of necklaces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His customer, Hannane, replies firmly that Islam does not advocate child marriage and that women can also play an important role outside the home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hannane is one of a new generation of female religious leaders, known as morchidat -- part of a quiet social revolution in the North African country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Their groundbreaking work is the subject of a British film, "Casablanca Calling", which will be showcased on Tuesday night at an international conference on child marriage in Morocco's famous port city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The morchidat were introduced in 2006, partly in an attempt to counter Islamist radicalism following suicide bombings that rocked Casablanca in 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The hope is that these female spiritual leaders can both encourage a more tolerant Islam and improve the position of girls and women in Moroccan society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The morchidat are a rare experiment in the Muslim world," the film's Moroccan associate producer Merieme Addou told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's the first time in a Muslim country that a religious role has been given to a woman."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The morchidat give guidance to women and young people in mosques, schools, orphanages, hospitals, prisons and rural villages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Addou says they have their work cut out as they try to overcome the many problems facing Moroccan society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"So many cultural traditions -- from early marriage to women's education -- have become confused with religious teaching and it is challenge to separate them in people's minds," she adds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The scene in the jewelry shop reflects some of the views the morchidat are trying to tackle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Morocco and other Muslim countries have been living in a long period of ignorance and stagnation," says Hannane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Many people knowingly or unknowingly have blocked the most basic rights Islam gives women."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>At a mosque, Hannane listens to a woman talk about her granddaughter's problems finding a husband.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Her granddaughter is 14.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Although Morocco has outlawed marriage under 18, early marriage is a common problem encountered by the morchidat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In a classroom, a teenager tells Hannane she has been promised to a boy since she was four years old and that it is becoming difficult to continue at school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"My family say now I'm getting married I shouldn't leave the house," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The morchidat tells her that when it comes to marriage "God has given a woman the right to choose for herself" and that the girl should stand up to her father using Sharia law to support her rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>There are now more than 400 morchidat working across Morocco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Addou says it is the first time women have had someone to talk to about spiritual, moral, social and personal issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Although the morchidat are outspoken on women's rights, she says they are not seen as a threat because what they say is rooted in religion which gives their message legitimacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In the rural northern area of Larache, we meet Bouchra, a morchidat who is championing girl's education.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Women toiling in the fields describe lives of servitude in a region where few girls go to school, illiteracy rates are sky high, misogyny entrenched and domestic abuse not uncommon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Women are doomed and then they die," comments one fieldworker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In the evenings Bouchra mentors girls at rural boarding schools for the poor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>One evening she is called to a dormitory after a student commits suicide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>She is told the girl's father had seen her with a boy and beaten her in front of her friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The morchidat initiative is part of wider reforms in Morocco aimed at giving women more rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Addou says other Muslim countries are taking an interest in the work of Morocco's female religious leaders, some of whom have been invited to speak abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>One of these is a bright, cheerful woman called Karima, who works in Rabat where she is concerned about the numbers of young people wanting to migrate to the West.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>She believes that until young Moroccans feel proud of their Muslim identity and culture, mass emigration and violent extremism will continue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Addou says "Casablanca Calling", which is set to air on Al Jazeera this year, provides a glimpse of a world rarely seen in the West.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"My vision of Islam is very different from what many people in the West think," says Addou.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"Many think Islam oppresses woman and restricts their freedoms, but this is because of traditions that have nothing to do with Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"Men and women are equal in our religion. There is no difference."</td></tr>
