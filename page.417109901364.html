<h3>Ghana defender Jonathan Mensah banned 4 months by FIFA</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ghana defender Jonathan Mensah has been banned for four months by FIFA in a breach-of-contract case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Court of Arbitration for Sport said its appeal panel upheld Mensah's suspension imposed by FIFA last July in a case dating to 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He is also liable for compensation to former club Udinese.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, FIFA said Tuesday that Mensah - who played at the past two World Cup tournaments - is eligible to play for Ghana next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It hosts Mauritius in the opening match of a 2017 African Cup of Nations qualifying group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>FIFA judged that Mensah was still contracted to Udinese when he joined French club Evian Thonon Gaillard four years ago claiming to be a free agent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Under FIFA rules, Mensah will serve about one month of the ban until the French season ends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The sanction is not spent during the offseason and does not apply to national team friendlies or qualifiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mensah will become a free agent and is unlikely to stay with Evian, which has been relegated from the top division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He will serve the final three months of the ban from the official start of his next club's new season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 24-year-old Mensah played in all three Ghana matches in Brazil last June, including a 2-1 loss to the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He was a member of the Under-20 World Cup-winning team in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>CAS said the case has not ended for Evian, which FIFA could order to compensate Udinese and ban from signing players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The sporting sanctions that were imposed on Evian Thonon Gaillard ... are suspended and referred back to the (FIFA) Dispute Resolution Chamber," the court said.</td></tr>
