<h3>Germanwings crash: Air traffic controllers 'tried three times to radio pilots with no response'</h3>

<tr><td>2</td><td>Bild published this timeline of what it says happened to the Airbus (times are local, one hour ahead of GMT).</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>Aviation experts said that while the lack of communication could point to the pilots being incapacitated, they may have been simply too busy trying to get the aircraft under control, as they are taught to "aviate, navigate, communicate", in that order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>One of the plane's black boxes has been found, but it was unclear whether it was the flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Investigators will continue searching for the second black box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Weather did not appear to be a factor in the crash, with conditions calm at the time, French weather officials said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>Video images from a government helicopter on Tuesday showed a desolate snow-flecked moonscape, with steep ravines covered in scree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Debris was strewn across the mountainside, pieces of twisted metal smashed into tiny bits.</td></tr>
