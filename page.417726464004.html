<h3>Mexico cheer-dance Nazi routine criticised</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A cheer-dance team of about two dozen girls aged 10 to 16 and one boy in Mexico has drawn criticism for a routine involving flags with swastikas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A cheer-dance team in Mexico has drawn criticism for a routine in which they displayed flags with swastikas, dressed in pseudo-military outfits and one girl appeared to toss a Nazi salute to the crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The girls wore red armbands, camouflage dance outfits and carried red flags as they strutted in marching-style formations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A video of the performance drew condemnation when it began to circulate on Friday on social media sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On local news sites, many readers said the girls probably did not know much about the Nazis, and blamed the event organisers and the team's choreographer for the questionable routine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Event organiser Enrique Casas said he would not identify the team for security reasons, because the comments on social media sites "have been a little aggressive".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The comments have gone beyond freedom of expression ... and have included direct insults against the girls."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Casas said the routines were the individual choice of the 192 teams that participated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But he said organisers might put safeguards on the next competition to avoid hurting people's feelings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Cheer-dance competitions combine cheerleading and dance routines.</td></tr>
