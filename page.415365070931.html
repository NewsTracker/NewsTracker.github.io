<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Video posted online by Islamic State shows a boy killing an Israeli Arab accused by IS as working for Mossad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Beirut: A video posted online by militants of the so-called Islamic State on Tuesday purportedly shows a boy killing Muhammad Musallam, an Arab citizen of Israel accused by the group of having signed up as a jihadist to spy for Mossad, with a bullet to the head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The video, published by the group's Furqan media outlet on Tuesday, showed Musallam sitting in a room wearing an orange jumpsuit, talking about how he had been recruited and trained by the Israeli intelligence service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said his father and elder brother had encouraged him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After that, it showed Musallam being escorted to a field and executed by a boy, a child described by an older, French-speaking fighter as one of the "cubs of the caliphate".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The mother and father of Muhammad Musallam, an Israeli Arab held by Islamic State in Syria as an alleged spy, hold pictures of him in their Jerusalem home in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The authenticity of the footage, which also appeared on Twitter feeds used by IS supporters, could not immediately be verified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Israeli security officials said they were aware of the video but could not confirm that it was authentic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The video, which was about 13 minutes long, showed Musallam on his knees as he listened to the older fighter pronouncing the verdict in French.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Then the boy, wearing a military uniform and armed with a pistol, stands face to face with Musallam and fires one bullet into his forehead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Musallam slumps, then the child shoots him three more times and chants "Allahu Akbar!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>(God is Greatest).</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>An image from a video reportedly released by the Islamic State through Al-Furqan, one of the Jihadist platforms used by the militant organisation on the web, shows a youth identifying himself as 19-year-old Mohammed Said Ismail Musallam from Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the video, Musallam repeated what he said last month in an interview published by the group's English-language magazine Dabiq, in which he said he had joined IS to report to the Israelis on weapons caches, bases and Palestinian recruits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Israel and his family denied that he was an Israeli spy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I tell my father and my son: Repent to God. I say to the spies who spy on Islamic State: You will not be successful, they will expose you," Musallam said in the latest video, in Arabic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Musallam's family have said he went missing while on a tourist trip to Turkey and an Israeli security official has said he went to Syria to fight for IS in October last year.</td></tr>
