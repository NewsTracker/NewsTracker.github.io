<tr><td>2</td><td>Dhaka, Bangladesh: A blogger who wrote for a website that promoted secularism was killed on Tuesday by a group of men wielding sharp weapons, a police official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was the third fatal attack on a Bangladeshi blogger since February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Four men chased the blogger, Ananta Bijoy Dash, through streets near his home in the northeastern city of Sylhet and attacked him, said Mohammad Rahamat Ullah, a police official in Sylhet.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>Imran Sarker, the head of an organisation of secular bloggers in Bangladesh, said Dash had written for Free Mind, a website that the Bangladeshi-American blogger Avijit Roy had moderated before being killed in February by machete-wielding assailants while leaving a book fair in Dhaka, the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Five weeks after Roy's death, another blogger, Oyasiqur Rhaman, was killed by three men with machetes in Dhaka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The deaths recalled the 2013 killing in Dhaka of the blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Haider, Roy and Rhaman were all part of a movement known as Shahbag, which called for the death penalty for Islamist political leaders who were implicated in atrocities committed during Bangladesh's 1971 war for independence from Pakistan.</td></tr>

<tr><td>16</td><td>The leader of the Indian branch of al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the deaths of Roy and Haider in a video posted on jihadi forums on May 2.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>Bangladeshi social activists hold a banner displaying a portrait of blogger and author Ananta Bijoy Das during a protest against his killing, in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Sarker called the state's response to the string of attacks inadequate, noting that few arrests had been made in the recent cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"This is frustrating, that one by one we are killed and the government is doing nothing," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The recent killings have drawn international condemnation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the US State Department, called Roy's killing "a cowardly assault on the universal principles enshrined in Bangladesh's Constitution."</td></tr>
