<h3>Blatter not traveling to Women's World Cup final in Canada</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA says President Sepp Blatter will not go to Canada for Sunday's Women's World Cup final, amid criminal investigations into soccer's governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Secretary General Jerome Valcke will also be absent from the biggest event in women's soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>FIFA said "due to their current commitments in Zurich, the FIFA President and the FIFA Secretary General will remain at the FIFA Headquarters."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Traveling to Canada would have taken Blatter to the doorstep of the United States, where he is a target of the investigation into alleged soccer corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There have been no charges or accusations against Blatter - unlike two of his vice presidents, who remain in custody in Switzerland.</td></tr>
