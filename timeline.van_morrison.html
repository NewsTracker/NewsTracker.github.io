<li>Mia Michaels of "So You Think You Can Dance" fame is the show's choreographer and knew Morrison as he was coming up the ranks in the theater world.</li>
<li>While he's been away from New York, Morrison has seen the profile of Broadway and theater increase, in part due to shows like "Glee" and "Smash."</li>

<li>Morrison, 36, plays J.M. Barrie, the "Peter Pan" author, in the adaptation from the 2004 whimsical film of the same name about a widow whose four young sons inspired Barrie to write the children's classic.</li>
<li>Morrison had previously starred on Broadway in "Hairspray," ''South Pacific" and "The Light in the Piazza," for which he was nominated for a 2005 Tony Award.</li>

<li>"I just imagine her welcome guests back in her pearls and everything," Morrison said, sipping tea.</li>
<li>"There's nothing more challenging or exciting than doing a brand new Broadway show," said Morrison.</li>
<li>The show ended earlier this year and Morrison's last scene was of him singing "Teach Your Children" by Crosby Stills, Nash & Young in dedication to all his fictional students, many who are in tears by the end of the song.</li>
<li>Morrison barely had time to say goodbye to Schuester before it was time to tackle Barrie.</li>

<li>That number increased with Monday's release of Morrison's new album, "Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue."</li>
<li>For Morrison, "There were two parts to it," the 69-year-old artist told The Times in an exclusive email interview.</li>
<li>Morrison has spent the vast majority of his career looking ahead, writing and recording a string of studio albums that now numbers more than three dozen; "Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue" represents a rare dip into his past.</li>
<li>During that event, Morrison invited Staples, Womack and Cole to go into a recording studio to get the ball rolling.</li>
<li>"I first heard him in the '60s at a show with Aretha Franklin and Dr. John and I thought then, 'Who is this guy?'" Mahal told The Times at a performance Morrison gave last summer outside his hometown of Belfast.</li>
<li>"What I love about Van so much was that you couldn't categorize him," said Buble, who sings one of his favorite Morrison songs, "Real Real Gone," on the album.</li>
<li>Morrison's storied back catalog, which stretches back to his recordings with the Irish rock band Them in 1965, encompasses hundreds of songs that he and his duet partners drew from for the new album.</li>

<li>Their easy camaraderie makes one miss the late John Lee Hooker, who teamed with Morrison for some of the finest duets of their respective careers.</li>
<li>Chris Farlowe, who has joined Morrison on stage at times, teams up with him on "Born To Sing" and former bandmate Georgie Fame duets on "Get On With the Show."</li>
<li>There's plenty to hear, and there's plenty more hidden away in Morrison's impressive archives.</li>
