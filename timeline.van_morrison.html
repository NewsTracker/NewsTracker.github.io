<li>Morrison's latest book, "God Help the Child," will be released on Tuesday, April 21, 2015.</li>
<li>NEW YORK (AP) - Toni Morrison has written 11 novels and won all the great prizes, but found herself struggling with her new book, "God Help the Child."</li>
<li>There are no stand-ins for Morrison in her novel, no one who lives even remotely like the world famous, 84-year-old Nobel laureate.</li>
<li>Writing is Morrison's path to outside of herself, but it's undertaken alone, in her imagination: The Civil War era in "Beloved," the 1920s in "Jazz," colonial times in "A Mercy."</li>

<li>NEW YORK (AP) - It's taken six years for Matthew Morrison to get back on Broadway so it's no surprise he knows a thing or two about where he ended up.</li>
<li>"I just imagine her welcome guests back in her pearls and everything," Morrison said, sipping tea.</li>
<li>Morrison, 36, plays J.M. Barrie, the "Peter Pan" author, in the adaptation from the 2004 whimsical film of the same name about a widow whose four young sons inspired Barrie to write the children's classic.</li>
<li>"There's nothing more challenging or exciting than doing a brand new Broadway show," said Morrison.</li>
<li>The show ended earlier this year and Morrison's last scene was of him singing "Teach Your Children" by Crosby Stills, Nash & Young in dedication to all his fictional students, many who are in tears by the end of the song.</li>
<li>Morrison barely had time to say goodbye to Schuester before it was time to tackle Barrie.</li>

<li>That number increased with Monday's release of Morrison's new album, "Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue."</li>
<li>Among his 16 duet partners: Mavis Staples, Taj Mahal, Michael Buble, Natalie Cole, the late Bobby Womack and Morrison's daughter, Shana Morrison.</li>
<li>For Morrison, "There were two parts to it," the 69-year-old artist told The Times in an exclusive email interview.</li>
<li>Morrison has spent the vast majority of his career looking ahead, writing and recording a string of studio albums that now numbers more than three dozen; "Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue" represents a rare dip into his past.</li>
<li>During that event, Morrison invited Staples, Womack and Cole to go into a recording studio to get the ball rolling.</li>
<li>"I first heard him in the '60s at a show with Aretha Franklin and Dr. John and I thought then, 'Who is this guy?'" Mahal told The Times at a performance Morrison gave last summer outside his hometown of Belfast.</li>
