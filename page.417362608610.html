<tr><td>9</td><td>Buhari has vowed to spare no effort to defeat the Boko Haram armed group which has killed thousands and displaced more than a million people in a six-year campaign to establish a caliphate in the northeast region abutting Lake Chad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>About 30 countries have sent high-level representatives for the ceremony, many from the rest of the African continent, which stands to gain if Buhari is able to breathe new life into the economy and restore Abuja's diplomatic credibility and clout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>South African President Jacob Zuma attended the ceremony - a sign of Pretoria's desire to improve relations with Abuja after a series of diplomatic spats under Jonathan, including the deaths of 84 South Africans in a Lagos church building collapse in September, and a wave of attacks on foreigners in South Africa this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>US Secretary of State John Kerry, British foreign secretary Philip Hammond and French foreign minister Laurent Fabius were also at the event.</td></tr>
