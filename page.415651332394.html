<h3>German tourist killed in Egypt shark attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The attack happened at a resort on Egypt's Red Sea, and police have revealed it is the first fatal shark attack in the region since 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 52-year-old man's body has been moved to a local hospital after the attack yesterday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Officials are conducting an investigation into the attack, which saw the man's leg bitten off at the knee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>State news agency Al-Ahram report that the tourist was swimming with his wife when the attack happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An official from the German Embassy in Cairo says they received reports that a German citizen died in the area but are not aware of the cause of death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was the first fatal shark attack in Egypt since a string of maulings in 2010 that left a German woman dead and three Russian tourists wounded in another Red Sea resort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In 2010, the German pensioner was mauled to death as she snorkelled in relatively shallow waters around the resort, which is famed for its scuba diving sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She died just a day after Egyptian authorities lifted a 48-hour ban prompted by four other savage shark attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One victim lost a hand and another lost a leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Red Sea is home to several species of shark, but the type believed to have been behind the 2010 attacks was the oceanic whitetip common to the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The attacks in 2010 forced the government to close off a stretch of beach in the Sharm el-Sheikh resort for a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In 2009, a shark killed a French woman off another resort close to where the German tourist was attacked on Sunday.</td></tr>
