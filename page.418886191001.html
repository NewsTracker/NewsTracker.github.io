<h3>Mexico to clean seaweed from coast, monitor floating masses</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) " Mexican authorities say they are working to clean sargassum seaweed from 112 miles (180 kilometers) of the country's Caribbean coast and will try to prevent more from coming ashore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Environment Department said Tuesday that the government is setting up air and sea monitoring of sargassum mats "to prevent them from reaching the coast."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The department said the "unusual" seaweed accumulation could be due to high levels of nutrients in ocean water, climate change or changes in ocean temperatures, currents or wind patterns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The seaweed removal efforts will cover Holbox in the north through Cancun, Isla Mujeres, Playa de Carmen, Cozumel, Akumal, Tulum and as far south as Mahahual.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sargassum is an algae that grows in the Sargasso Sea, a large body of warm water in the mid-Atlantic.</td></tr>
