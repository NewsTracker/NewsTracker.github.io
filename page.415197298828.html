<h3>EU court backs UK on euro trading</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>So-called clearing houses ensure financial contracts such as futures are honoured, reducing risk for traders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In its role as financial overseer, the ECB wanted to make clearing houses that mainly process trades denominated in euros to be based in one of the 19 euro states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Today the General Court annulled the policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>London is Europe's predominant financial centre and the ECB's proposal could have eroded its position and cost thousands of jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Britain called the decision "a major win".</td></tr>
