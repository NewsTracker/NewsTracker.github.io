<h3>Liberal U.S. Senator Sanders to challenge Clinton in 2016 race</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, launched a long-shot bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, a move likely to pressure Hillary Clinton from the left on issues from income inequality to corporate governance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sanders, one of the most outspoken liberals in Congress, called for rebuilding the middle class and reducing the influence of wealthy Americans and businesses on U.S. elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We're in this race to win," Sanders said at a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The 73-year-old, second-term senator faces long odds against the fund-raising might and name recognition of Clinton, the Democratic front-runner and former U.S. secretary of state, senator and first lady.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sanders highlighted his fight against authorizing the Iraq war, which Clinton voted for as a senator, and his opposition to trade deals that liberals and labor unions fear could hurt American workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton has not expressed her position but said trade deals should help workers and protect U.S. security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sanders said he would campaign as an "independent Democrat," saying that running as a third-party candidate in the November 2016 election would be too difficult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Democratic National Committee said in a statement that it welcomed Sanders' announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The former Burlington, Vermont, mayor, has cultivated a liberal following for defending expanding Social Security and raising taxes on the wealthy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Brooklyn native calls himself a "democratic socialist," and says voters know that is different from foreign leaders who call themselves socialists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>His entry could nudge Clinton to take more liberal positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It could also give her cover against complaints that she will coast to the nomination untested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A Clinton spokesman did not immediately have a comment on Sanders' bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Some could see Sanders as a substitute for U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a darling of the left who has said she is not running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Erica Sagrans of Ready for Warren said in a statement the group was "excited" Sanders is running but still wants Warren to jump in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Similar pressure comes from former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, who has not formally entered the race but has staked out liberal positions on issues such as free trade agreements being negotiated by the White House.</td></tr>
