<h3>Latest on Baltimore police-custody death: Rough van rides?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Latest on Baltimore police-custody death: Rough van rides?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>People in Baltimore and other cities accuse police of sometimes giving prisoners an extra-rough "nickel ride" in the back of a transport van and are asking whether this tactic might have been a factor in the death of Freddie Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Gray was arrested and put into a transport van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He died a week later of a mysterious spinal injury suffered at some point while in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A lawyer for the family of Dondi Johnson says that's he died of a "rough ride" after his arrest for public urination in Baltimore in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Attorney Kerry D. Staton said Johnson was seated alone in the van with his hands cuffed behind him and no seat belt to restrain him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Staton says Johnson was thrown from one seat into the opposite wall, and that's how he broke his neck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Johnson's family won a $7.4 million judgment that was reduced to $200,000, the legal cap for such cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In 2001, Philadelphia police barred transportation of prisoners without padding or belts after The Philadelphia Enquirer reported the city had paid $2.3 million to settle lawsuits by people subjected to intentionally rough rides, including two who were permanently paralyzed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A lawyer for the Baltimore police officers union says Freddie Gray wasn't strapped in with a seat belt after he was hoisted into a police van and driven to a Baltimore station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If that's correct, the officers who arrested Gray would appear to have violated a policy issued by their own department just nine days before the April 12 arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The document, released by a police department spokesman, says "all passengers, regardless of age and location, shall be restrained by seat belts or other authorized restraining devices."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Assistant Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said Gray was secured by "leg irons" after he became agitated during the trip, but the department hasn't said whether he was left otherwise unsecured, as Attorney Michael Davey has said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Davey acknowledged that department policy requires seat belts, but said "policy is policy, practice is something else," particularly if a prisoner is combative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Officials in Baltimore are urging commuters to head home early as the city prepares for more large protests in the police-custody death of Freddie Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Protesters plan to gather Thursday afternoon at City Hall and near the site of Gray's arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Gray died of a mysterious spinal injury he suffered after he was arrested April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The city's Department of Transportation is warning drivers to expect heavy congestion with "unpredictable conditions" through the afternoon and evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They encourage workers to leave downtown before 3 p.m. "to avoid major disruptions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The governor of Maryland is sending state troopers to Baltimore to help with protests following the police-custody death of Freddie Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Gov. Larry Hogan's office said Thursday that a team of 32 troopers are being sent to help with crowd control at the request of Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Baltimore police say it's common to ask for troopers to help with events that have large crowds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>There have been demonstrations for nearly a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>On Wednesday night, the protest splintered into two groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>As one group cursed at police and threw some soda cans at them, another group marched 20 blocks to City Hall, at times blocking intersections and disruption traffic as they shouted: "No justice, no peace."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Three people were detained, no one was hurt and the protests remained largely peaceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>A civil rights group says it will conduct its own investigation into the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died of a mysterious spinal injury he suffered after he was arrested by Baltimore police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Baltimore chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference said Thursday that a former Philadelphia police officer will conduct the investigation for the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Baltimore police are doing an internal investigation and the Justice Department has opened a probe to see if Gray's civil rights were violated when he was arrested April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Rev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>C.D. Witherspoon, the head of the civil rights' group's local chapter, said an independent investigation is needed because police brutality in Baltimore has gone unpunished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"We have no faith in City Hall," Witherspoon said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"You can prove us wrong. We challenge City Hall to prove us wrong."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Former Philadelphia officer Terence Jones will lead the investigation by speaking with witnesses to the arrest.</td></tr>
