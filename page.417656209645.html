<h3>Poll: Americans less willing than Europeans to send financial aid to Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MOSCOW - A new survey shows that Americans are less willing than Europeans to send economic aid to Ukraine, where the government is struggling to keep the economy afloat while battling Russian-backed separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At the same time, Americans would be more willing than Europeans to use military force against Russia if it were to attack a neighboring country that was a member of NATO, according to the survey released early Wednesday by the Pew Research Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While Ukraine is not a NATO member, other former Soviet republics are and they worry that the Western alliance would not defend them if it meant military confrontation with Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The survey examined public opinion in eight NATO countries: the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The interviews were conducted in April and May among about 1,000 adults in each country, with margins of error ranging from plus or minus 3.4 to 4.1 percentage points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Of the eight countries, only Italy was less supportive of sending economic aid to Ukraine than the U.S., where 62 percent of those surveyed were in favor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Support was highest in Poland and Spain, at 77 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But when asked whether NATO should send arms to Ukraine, the U.S. and Poland were most in favor, at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Germany was at the bottom of the pack with only 19 percent support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Americans and Germans were also at opposite ends on the question of whether their country should use military force to defend a NATO ally if it were attacked by Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the U.S., 56 percent surveyed said yes, while in Germany only 38 percent said they would support military action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In Italy and Poland, the interviews were conducted face-to-face; in the other six countries they were done over the telephone, on land lines and cell phones.</td></tr>
