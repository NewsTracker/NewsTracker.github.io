<h3>Judge Won't Block Part of Seattle's Minimum Wage Law</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>in support of raising the minimum wage locally to $15 an hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A federal judge on Tuesday March 17, 2015 cleared the way for Seattle's new minimum wage law to take effect as planned next month, rejecting claims by franchises of big national chains that it discriminates against them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A federal judge on Tuesday cleared the way for Seattle's new minimum wage law to take effect as planned next month, rejecting claims by franchises of big national chains that it discriminates against them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In his 43-page decision Tuesday night, U.S. District Judge Richard A. Jones rejected all of the arguments brought forth by the International Franchise Association, which represents national chains ranging from fast food joints to hotels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Lawyers for the franchise association, including Paul Clement, the former U.S. solicitor general, insisted that they were not challenging the minimum wage itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Instead, they were challenging how quickly their clients must adopt it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The law, which will eventually raise the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour, is phased in more quickly for big companies than small ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Among those determined to be big companies under the law are franchises that are connected to networks that have a total of more than 500 workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In arguments before the judge last week, Clement said that was unfair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The franchises are essentially small businesses, but by 2017 they'll have to pay their workers a minimum wage $4 an hour higher than their purely local competitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The franchises cited various legal grounds, including the argument that the city's law would affect interstate commerce - in violation of the U.S. Constitution, which reserves its regulation to the federal government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Jones dismissed that notion and ruled that the possible harm to the franchises "does not outweigh the concrete harm" that would be suffered by employees who are entitled to an increase in their wages under the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said there was simply "no evidence" that the city's ordinance would have any effect at all on interstate commerce, and that its adoption fell well within the purview of the City Council and the mayor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The city argued that the advantages franchises receive from their national organizations - including marketing, advertising and training - provided legitimate reason to require them to adopt the $15 wage more quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The Ordinance is, at least putatively, designed to assist low wage workers, to decrease the gender wage gap, and to ensure that workers can better support and care for their families and fully participate in Seattle's civic, cultural and economic life - objectives that are well within the scope of legitimate municipal policymaking," the judge wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On April 1, the large businesses and national chains must raise their pay to at least $11 an hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Smaller ones must pay at least $10 an hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Seattle's current minimum wage is $9.47, the same as the Washington state minimum wage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The franchises sought a preliminary injunction that would block the relevant part of the law from taking effect, pending a ruling from Jones expected later this year on the full merits of the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"This is a great day for Seattle's fast food franchise workers," Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said in a statement Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This ruling ensures that on April 1st, the minimum wage will go up for everyone in our city.</td></tr>

<h3>SXSW: 'Krisha' and 'Peace Officer' win top jury prizes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The director of the narrative feature grand jury prize winner had a backpack strapped on, another prize-winner wore shorts and a baseball cap, and more than a few hugs and tears could be seen as the South by Southwest Film Conference and Festival gave out its awards Tuesday night, capturing the casual feel and small, honest emotions of the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Krisha," directed by Trey Edward Shults, won the grand jury prize in the narrative feature competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Peace Officer," directed by Scott Christopherson and Brad Barber, took the grand jury prize in the documentary feature competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The awards were announced in a ceremony at the Paramount Theater hosted by "Saturday Night Live" cast member Vanessa Bayer, who also appeared in the movie "Trainwreck," which had its world premiere at the festival on Sunday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bayer kept the mood playfully off-kilter throughout the evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bayer finished her opening monologue by saying, "If hosting an awards show where you don't understand what most of the awards are is wrong, then I don't want to be right."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Shults is a Texas-based filmmaker and his feature debut, "Krisha," is an expansion of a short film that played SXSW just last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The film stars Krisha Fairchild (Stults' real-life aunt) in a story that traces the impact of addiction on one family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This is overwhelming, I don't know what to say, I wasn't expecting this," said Shults, a backpack double-strapped on his back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This is a family-and-friends affair, purely. I love all of them and it couldn't have been done without any of them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Exiting the stage alongside other cast and crew to head off for a group photo, Fairchild shouted back to the theater, "somebody watch my purse!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Peace Officer" is a study of the growing militarization of police departments in the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The story is largely told through that of Dub Lawrence, a former Utah sheriff who established the state's first SWAT team only to see that same unit kill his son-in-law in a standoff decades later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It is the first feature film for both Christopherson and Barber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Taking the stage, Christopherson said, "I can't believe we even got into this festival, let alone win this award."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We lost someone so special recently, all of us, Albert Maysles," said Barber, referring to the acclaimed documentarian who died earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"He really influenced us and he said something, he said you should love your documentary subjects and that's something we try to keep in mind. Thanks, Al."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In the narrative competition, special jury recognition for visual excellence went to "Creative Control" directed by Benjamin Dickinson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On the documentary side, special recognition for directing went to Alex Sichel and Elizabeth Giamatti for "A Woman Like Me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The documentary jury also gave special recognition for editing to Jeff Consiglio for "Twinsters," directed by Samantha Futerman and Ryan Miyamoto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Three special awards were also announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Yvonne Kerekgyarto won the SXSW game-changer award for female directors for "Free Entry," Bill Ross and Turner Ross won the Louis Black "Lone Star" award for Texas film for "Western" and Anna Gustavi won the Karen Schmeer Film Editing Fellowship, given to documentary film editors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Michael Mohan's "Pink Grapefruit" won the narrative short award, while Meg Smaker's "Boxeadora" won the documentary short prize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Gillian Wallace Horvat's "Kiss Kiss Fingerbang" won for midnight short and Don Hertzfeldt's "World of Tomorrow" won for animated short.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A prize for excellence in poster design went to Yen Tan's work for "Manson Family Vacation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The excellence in title design prize went to Dan Gregoras for Imaginary Forces and his work on "Manhattan."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The 2015 SXSW Film Festival ends Saturday, when audience award winners will be announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>We're at South by Southwest until Sunday.</td></tr>
