<tr><td>2</td><td>A check for that amount from the Washington Redskins' Original Americans Foundation was made out to the rodeo association of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tribal Council Vice Chairman Ryman LeBeau told The Associated Press that the council voted Wednesday to return the current donation and any future money from the organization.</td></tr>
