<tr><td>44</td><td>Morgan, 18, turned and quickly shook one of the officer's hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Asked why, he said: "At the end of the day, I don't think all cops are bad, just that some are corrupt."</td></tr>

<tr><td>48</td><td>Some protesters hurled obscenities and threw soda cans and bottles at the line of police behind the barricades, but none hit the officers and the demonstration remained largely peaceful.</td></tr>

<tr><td>57</td><td>Washington grew up with Gray and called him a good person who didn't need to die.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>She didn't understand why the six officers involved in Gray's arrest are still drawing a paycheck while they're suspended.</td></tr>
