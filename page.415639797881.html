<h3>Barack Obama: Now 'hard to find a path' on Israeli-Palestinian peace</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington: US President Barack Obama has said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's pre-election disavowal of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict makes it "hard to find a path" towards serious negotiations to resolve the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In his first public comments on the matter since Mr Netanyahu's victory, Mr Obama said he told the Israeli leader that his remarks in the closing days of his re-election campaign had upended the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and ran counter to the very nature of Israeli democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In an interview with the Huffington Post , Mr Obama discussed his Thursday phone call with Mr Netanyahu, two days after the Israeli leader was re-elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Benjamin Netanyahu gestures to supporters at party headquarters in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I did indicate to him that we continue to believe that a two-state solution is the only way for the long-term security of Israel, if it wants to stay both a Jewish state and democratic," Mr Obama said, in an unusually forceful and public condemnation of the top official of a vital US ally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"And I indicated to him that given his statements prior to the election, it is going to be hard to find a path where people are seriously believing that negotiations are possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The worst crisis in US-Israeli relations in decades was worsened by Mr Netanyahu's declaration just before Tuesday's election that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ignoring the prime minister's attempts in post-election interviews to walk back his comments, Mr Obama made clear - as have senior members of his administration in recent days - that he believes Mr Netanyahu is opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Well, we take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership, and so that's why we've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don't see a chaotic situation in the region," Mr Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The White House had said after Mr Obama's call on Thursday that the President waited two days to place, that Mr Obama had told Mr Netanyahu that Washington would "reassess" its options on US-Israel relations and Middle East diplomacy after the Israeli leader's comment on Palestinian statehood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Obama also expressed dismay in the Huffington Post over Mr Netanyahu's election day warning to his supporters about Arab Israeli voters going to the polls "in droves".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict prior to his re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We indicated that that kind of rhetoric was contrary to what is the best of Israel's traditions, that although Israel was founded based on the historic Jewish homeland and the need to have a Jewish homeland, Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly," Mr Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"And I think that that is what's best about Israeli democracy. If that is lost, then I think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who don't believe in a Jewish state, but it also, I think, starts to erode the name of democracy in the country," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The president's comments were the latest evidence that the toxic relationship with Mr Netanyahu, for years a source of frustration and anger for both men, has reached a new low and that the White House is engaged in a remarkably public feud with the Israeli prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Obama said the disagreements would not interfere with the military and intelligence cooperation between the United States and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But he made it clear that his administration was unhappy with the policies under Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"While taking into complete account Israel's security, we can't just in perpetuity maintain the status quo, expand settlements - that's not a recipe for stability in the region," Mr Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>King Richard III's new hand-carved coffin Barack Obama: Now 'hard to find a path' on Israeli-Palestinian peace US troops withdrawn as Yemen crisis worsens after mosque attacks Chile's Bishop Juan Barros, linked to sex abuse priest, faces Catholic fury Was that a Russian sub in my fishing net?</td></tr>
