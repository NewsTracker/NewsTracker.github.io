<h3>EU ties lifting Russia sanctions to full Ukraine peace accord</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>EU leaders at a summit meeting in Brussels did not formally agree to extend the sanctions due to expire in July unless renewed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But the link to the Minsk agreement effectively extends sanctions until the end of the year because the accord sets a number of deadlines for the end of 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The duration of economic sanctions will be clearly linked to the full implementation of the Minsk agreement," Tusk told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We have to maintain our sanctions until the Minsk agreement is fully implemented."</td></tr>
