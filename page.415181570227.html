<h3>Kenya burns 15 tonnes of ivory in anti-poaching fight, to destroy its stockpile by year-end [Photos]</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Poaching has surged in the last few years across sub-Saharan Africa, where gangs kill elephants and rhinos to feed Asian demand for ivory and horns for use in folk medicines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A 2014 UN and Interpol report estimated that about 20,000 to 25,000 elephants were killed in Africa every year, out of a total population of as many as 650,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"As part of Kenya's continued policy to put ivory beyond economic use ... I will today burn 15 tonnes of ivory at this historic site in Nairobi National Park," President Uhuru Kenyatta said during a ceremony at the park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"In order to underline our determination to eradicate poaching, my government shall burn the rest of the stockpile within this year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The ceremony was to mark the African Union-designated Wangari Maathai Day, in honour of the late environmentalist and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, and the World Wildlife Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kenya has imposed stiffer penalties -- longer jail terms and bigger fines -- for wildlife poaching or trafficking, saying poaching is harming tourism, a major earner of foreign exchange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In January 2014, a Kenyan court convicted a Chinese man of smuggling ivory and ordered him to pay a fine of 20 million shillings ($233,000) or serve seven years in jail, the first sentencing since Kenya introduced the new anti-poaching law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A Kenyan man is in police custody accused of being behind an international poaching syndicate involving elephant tusks and was linked to a three-tonne haul of ivory seized in Mombasa in June 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Illegal trade in wildlife has become a sophisticated transnational form of crime, comparable to other pernicious examples, such as trafficking of drugs, humans, counterfeit items and oil," UNSecretary General Ban Ki-Moon said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It is driven by rising demand, and is often facilitated by corruption and weak governance. There is strong evidence of the increased involvement of organized crime networks and non-State armed groups."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In 2011, then-President Mwai Kibaki set fire to five tonnes of contraband ivory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His predecessor, Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, did the same in 1989.</td></tr>
