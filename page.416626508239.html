<h3>Bali Nine: Gallery defends removing Joko portrait</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A photograph of Indonesian President Joko Widodo has been removed from the walls of the National Portrait Gallery 'for fear it would be damaged', as the government defends the AFP guidelines in the wake of the Bali Nine arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The federal government insists police are still taking the death penalty into account before they tip off foreign agencies about suspected Australian drug smugglers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Despite removing reference to the death penalty in his 2014 ministerial directive for the Australian Federal Police, Justice Minister Michael Keenan says strict guidelines that govern the agency's decisions on such matters remain in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The guidelines state the AFP must consider whether sharing information could put an Australian at risk of facing execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Keenan said the coalition is using the same guidelines introduced by the Rudd Labor government in 2009 following a review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the ministerial directives did not dictate the operations of the AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She accused Labor of playing cheap politics over the executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, a day after the drug smugglers were put to death in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Shame on them," Ms Bishop told reporters in Sydney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Labor leader Bill Shorten said the government must explain why the death penalty was removed from the ministerial directive and not absolve itself of responsibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Australians expected reassurance there was sufficient oversight of the AFP, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"What we do want to make sure is that what happened in the early hours of yesterday morning can't happen again," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Pressure is also mounting on the AFP to explain its role in tipping off Indonesia about the Bali Nine in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Robert Myers, the barrister who notified the AFP about the group, said since the guidelines were introduced, the agency had been cautious about acting in the same "abominable" way again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He blamed the AFP for Chan and Sukumaran's deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They gave these people to the Indonesians knowing what the consequence was going to be, on a platter," Mr Myers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran were guilty of masterminding a plot to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin out of Indonesia to Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The AFP declined to comment, referring questions to the minister's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The National Portrait Gallery has explained why it has taken a photograph of Indonesian President Joko Widodo off its walls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A photograph of Indonesian President Joko Widodo has been removed from the walls of the National Portrait Gallery for fear it would be damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Director Angus Trumble said it was a pre-emptive and temporary measure, following a negative reaction to the portrait by some visitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"My feeling yesterday, on Wednesday morning, was that in view of the circumstances and our operations, and my best assessment of the risk of damage to the work of art, it was necessary to remove it from public display," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Also, I was swayed by the statements of both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition and of course the position of the parliament and the recall of our ambassador.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It's a temporary measure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mr Trumble also said he disagreed with the artist, Adam Ferguson, "who feels the work should remain on display".</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Government is under pressure to explain why it scrapped a ministerial directive for federal police to consider the government's opposition to the death penalty when providing information to international agencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Questions over the directive follow calls for the Australian Federal Police to be quizzed over their role in the capture of the Bali Nine drug smugglers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed by firing squad on the Indonesian prison island of Nusakambangan on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The directive was instituted under Labor in 2010, but in May 2014, Justice Minister Michael Keenan issued an amended ministerial direction that includes no reference to the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>However, Mr Keenan said the government took no action to weaken the police guidelines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In a statement issued on Thursday, he said the current AFP National Guideline on International Police to Police Assistance in Death Penalty Situations reflected Australia's position on the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"The Government rejects any claim it has weakened the AFP guidelines," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The AFP guideline on international police-to-police assistance in death penalty situations says the agency is required to consider "relevant factors" before providing information to foreign law enforcement agencies if it is aware that information is likely to result in the prosecution of someone for a death penalty offence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The debate follows comments made by Opposition justice spokesman David Feeney, who called for clarity over whether the omission to ministerial direction changes the AFP's obligations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Can we still have confidence that there are protocols binding the AFP going forward?" he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop also criticised Mr Feeney's comments, labelling them a "cheap political shot".</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Mr Bishop told reporters on Thursday that the guidelines had been reviewed, but said claims that the Coalition removed the directive were "absolutely untrue".</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"I am shocked that less than 24 hours after the death of two young Australians, the Labor Party would seek to politicise this issue," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"The AFP guidelines that were put in place under the previous Labor Government remain in place. They are precisely the same guidelines."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Robert Myers, the barrister who tipped off the AFP about the Bali Nine in 2005, said the agency stands responsible for the deaths of the Australian duo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"They gave these people to the Indonesians knowing what the consequence was going to be, on a platter," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The Bali Nine ringleaders have been executed by Indonesia, while the other seven are still in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce says there is some public support for capital punishment in Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The bodies of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have reached Jakarta, where the diplomatic consequences of their executions are playing out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce has called for a national debate on the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The men's families trailed their loved ones' bodies to Jakarta in a bus on Wednesday, following their executions just after midnight on the prison island of Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Indonesia's attorney-general visited the site hours later and approved of what he saw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"This is a warning for others, don't even try to commit these drug crimes, to think a thousand times, that Indonesia will be strict, will be harsh on drug crimes," HM Prasetyo told reporters in Cilacap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Australia has recalled its ambassador from Jakarta and Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the families "have suffered an appalling tragedy".</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>President Joko Widodo didn't say anything directly about the diplomatic protest but argued again that Indonesia's sovereignty must be respected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>His Vice President Jusuf Kalla brushed off the recall as a usual protest measure, predicting Ambassador Paul Grigson would be back within months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>The men's bodies are safe in a Jakarta funeral home before being flown back to Sydney on Thursday or Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce has called for a national debate on the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Mr Joyce said some members of the Australian public support capital punishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>"I do get approached by people saying, `Well that might be your view, Barnaby, that you don't support the death penalty, but it's not our view'.", he told ABC TV.</td></tr>
