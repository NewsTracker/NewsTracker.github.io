<h3>Homeland funding appears on track minus immigration add-ons</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a major victory for President Barack Obama, the Republican-led House overcame last-minute opposition from GOP critics on Tuesday and moved toward final passage of legislation to fund the Homeland Security Department without restrictions on immigration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bill's approval was assured after Republicans demanding the bill include constraints on Obama's immigration policy were turned back on a test vote of 140-278.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Obama's signature was assured on the measure, which cleared the Senate last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Without it, short-term funding for the department would expire on Friday at midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Bitterly admitting defeat, the Republican-controlled Congress sent legislation to President Barack Obama on Tuesday that funds the Department of Homeland Security without any of the immigration-related concessions they demanded for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Obama promised to sign the bill as soon as he received it, while criticizing Congress for taking "far too long" to pass it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Sanity is prevailing," said Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Peter King, R-N.Y., a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, before the House voted 257-167 in favor of the $40 billion spending bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>All 182 Democrats present voted for the bill, while it received only 75 Republican "yes" votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I am glad that House Republicans finally came to their senses," said Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Loretta Sanchez of California, a top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The outcome averted a partial agency shutdown which would have begun Friday at midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It was a major victory for Obama and the Democrats, and a wholesale retreat for Republicans, who have spent months railing against an "unconstitutional overreach" by Obama in extending deportation stays and work permits to millions of immigrants in this country illegally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the end, Republicans who'd tried to use the DHS spending bill to undo Obama's actions had little to show but weeks of gridlock and chaotic spectacle on Capitol Hill in the wake of assuming full control of Congress in the November midterm elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The turmoil brought the Homeland Security Department to within hours of a partial shutdown last Friday before Congress passed a one-week extension, and raised questions about Republicans' ability to govern responsibly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On Tuesday morning, addressing an uncharacteristically subdued gathering of House Republicans, Speaker John Boehner indicated he was out of options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I am as outraged and frustrated as you at the lawless and unconstitutional actions of this president," Boehner told his caucus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I believe this decision - considering where we are - is the right one for this team, and the right one for this country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Our Republican colleagues in the Senate never found a way to win this fight," he said, noting that the matter is now in the courts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A federal judge last month put Obama's directives on hold, a ruling the White House is appealing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Conservative lawmakers who humiliated Boehner last week by voting down a three-week spending bill he proposed did not speak up in the private meeting to dissent or ask questions, people present said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I don't know that there is one," said Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Steve King, R-Iowa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"This is the signal of capitulation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In a statement, Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson thanked Democrats and Republicans who voted for the bill and, "in particular, those in Congress who showed the leadership necessary to get the job done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In his own statement, Obama praised Homeland Security employees as "law enforcement professionals and brave patriots who do a remarkable job, and deserve our gratitude and respect. Today, after far too long, Congress finally voted to fully fund their mission."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The measure passed Tuesday funds the Homeland Security Department through the Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>30 end of the budget year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It pays for numerous priorities including Transportation Security agents, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, a host of immigration-related functions and grants to local governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>There have been suggestions that Boehner would face an insurrection by tea party-backed conservatives if he brought a "clean" DHS bill to the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But Boehner's opponents seemed resigned, and there was little sign of a brewing coup.</td></tr>

<h3>Ukraine says return of Crimea a must for mending ties with Russia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Klimkin, on the second day of his two-day trip to Japan, also said the border between Ukraine and Russia needed to be completely closed to achieve any settlement to the armed conflict between Kiev and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He reiterated his government's stance as a ceasefire deal, reached last month in Minsk, is broadly holding on the front line, but fighters in the separatist stronghold of Donetsk are training for another round of clashes against government troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"There could be no slightest way of normalizing or getting back to business in the relations between Ukraine and Russia without returning to status quo and establishing full Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea," Klimkin told reporters in Tokyo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The ultimate precondition for any effective, final settlement is to fully close down the Ukrainian-Russian border," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Because everything that has been destabilizing the situation in (the Ukrainian cities of) Donetsk and Lugansk - mercenaries, money, weapons, heavy weaponry, and of course Russian rebel troops - came through the Russian-Ukrainian border."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ukraine and Western governments have accused Russia of sending troops and weapons to support separatists in eastern Ukraine, despite the peace deal agreed on Feb. 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Moscow has denied this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We stress from the very beginning that we've been striving for a peaceful solution. But we will use any means for defending Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty," Klimkin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday that Moscow and pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine must implement the ceasefire or face "consequences" that could further hit Russia's faltering economy.</td></tr>
