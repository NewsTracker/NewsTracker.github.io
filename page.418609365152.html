<h3>MH17 crash: Ukraine points finger at Russia as families mark anniversary</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An unidentified woman and her grandchild from Indonesia look at the hedge of compassion before a ceremony for the victims of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands, on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hrabove, Ukraine: Families of the victims of the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 gathered in the Netherlands to mark the first anniversary of the tragedy, as Ukraine's president accused Russia's military of responsibility for the disaster which killed 298 civilians, 38 of them Australian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Today is a hard day, a day of reliving," Dutch Prime Minister Mark told 1500 mourners at a ceremony of music and dance at which the names of the victims were read out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The 298 unique people we remember today are for always bound with your lives and those of thousands of others," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Of the 298 victims, 196 were from the Netherlands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The wife of the airliner's first officer took the stage to read out the passenger announcement her husband was never able to make.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Salam alaikum and good evening," she said, her voice trembling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We will begin our descent shortly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, from where flight MH17 departed, and at towns across the Netherlands, sunflowers were laid like those that grow at the crash site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Flags flew at half-mast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ukraine has consistently blamed Russia, but President Petro Poroshenko's comments were his most direct to date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"MH17, where 298 victims were killed for no reason, was shot down by a Russian Buk missile, launched by a Russian professional crew under an order and an instruction from the Russian military," Mr Poroshenko said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Russia denies responsibility and in turn has pointed the finger at Ukraine, whose forces are fighting pro-Russian separatist rebels in the region of eastern Ukraine where the plane crashed to earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Poroshenko did not say what evidence he had for accusing the Russian military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In comments later on Friday, he used a different form of words, blaming the tragedy on Russian-trained "terrorists" - a description often used by the Ukrainian government to describe the separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In rebel-held eastern Ukraine, a church service was held and residents joined a procession to a gravestone near the charred area where twisted metal and body parts came crashing down on July 17 last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"To the memory of the dead - 298 innocent victims of civil war," was written on the gravestone in the village of Hrabove, where a Russian Orthodox priest and an imam said prayers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>About 300 people brought flowers and flags of the victims' countries, some with black ribbons attached, and released white balloons into the sky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The memory of these people will always be in our hearts | Pray for their souls," said a priest who gave his name as Oleg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Western governments believe that pro-Russian rebels shot the plane out of the sky with a Russian-supplied Buk missile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Britain and Ukraine marked the anniversary with new appeals for an international tribunal to prosecute suspects, an option also favoured by Malaysia, Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed those calls as premature and counterproductive on Thursday in a phone call with Mr Rutte and criticised "politicised" versions of the incident "planted" in foreign media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Western diplomats say they are open to the prospect of a tribunal that is not backed by the UN if Russia wields its Security Council veto.</td></tr>
