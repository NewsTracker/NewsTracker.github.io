<h3>Chad says hundreds of Boko Haram militants, 9 soldiers killed in clash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>N'DJAMENA, April 1 (Reuters) - Chad's army said its forces had killed hundreds of Boko Haram militants and lost nine of its own troops in clashes in northern Nigeria on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Soldiers from Chad and Niger drove the insurgents from Malam Fatori, one of Boko Haram's last major footholds near Nigeria's border with Niger, earlier this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Wednesday's clashes took place as they were mopping up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There was fighting and we recorded nine dead and 16 injured. There were hundreds of dead on Boko Haram's side," said Colonel Azem Bermandoa, a spokesman for Chad's army.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bermandoa said the fighting had driven militants more than 10 km (6 miles) outside the town, which had been held by the militants since November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There was no immediate comment from Niger's army on any casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Boko Haram's bid to create a caliphate in the north-east forced Nigeria to delay in an election due in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An offensive by Nigerian, Chadian and Nigerien troops has since pushed militants out of most of the towns they previously controlled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Militants failed to deliver on threats to cause havoc during the rescheduled election, and president-elect Muhammadu Buhari promised on Wednesday to "spare no effort" to defeat the group, which seized swathes of territory under outgoing president Goodluck Jonathan.</td></tr>
