<h3>Time will tell if Apple Watch catches on, as Apple fans wait</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK - For all those who hailed the iPhone as the "Jesus Phone" in 2007, the Apple Watch's arrival has hardly been the second coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sure, it can do many useful, even delightful things, such as showing us incoming texts and email, tracking our heart rate during exercise or letting us send digital doodles to friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But is that enough to spend $350 or more, especially when it requires wearing a watch again?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After all, smartphones have negated the need for watches to tell time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Early Apple Watch owners seem generally happy with it, but Apple's bigger worry should be those on the sidelines - even hardcore Apple fans, not to mention the rest of us - who are waiting to take the plunge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apple hasn't released sales figures, but its quarterly financial report Tuesday suggests that they were lower than many Wall Street analysts expected, even though they exceeded Apple's internal projections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some people are waiting for early kinks to be worked out and others, for an "aha moment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's been cast as a want, not a need," said Matt Quick, a Topeka, Kansas, engineer and Apple fan who is holding off on getting one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I'm kind of waiting to see what next year's model will bring."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Patrick Clayton, who has had Mac computers all his life and owns an iPhone and several iPads, returned his Apple Watch after three weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The last straw?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It nagged the physically active New Yorker to stand up during a six-hour flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Apple is famous for telling us what we need before we need them," Clayton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I thought this would be the case with the watch. But it (just) added something to my life that I didn't need added."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That's not to say the Apple Watch is a bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Most analysts and tech reviewers, including The Associated Press, see promise, especially compared with rival smartwatches from Samsung and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Wristly, a research company created to study the watch, found that early buyers are overwhelmingly satisfied, more so than with the original iPad and iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And of the more than a dozen early Apple Watch owners interviewed by the AP by phone, email or in person, most of them love their watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After all, early adopters of new technologies tend to understand that what they're getting isn't perfect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I'd recommend it to people with an open mind," said Dennis Falkenstein of Danville, California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said the watch gets him "everything I want" such as local temperature, or the current time in Japan, where many of his business clients are.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But even so, there's a long wish list, including smarter apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Apple is already addressing some of this with a software update this fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Falkenstein would also like to see the battery life improve from the 18 hours that's currently promised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>On Tuesday, Apple reported $2.6 billion in revenue from "other products," which includes the watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>That's about $952 million more than the previous quarter, when the watch had not yet gone on sale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting $1.8 billion in watch sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told The Associated Press that revenue from the watch amounted to "well over" that $952 million increase, as the category includes products whose sales fell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Maestri said the watch did better than iPhones and iPads in a comparable period after those products launched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Apple has run television commercials showing the watch in everyday life, and it has devoted tables at its retail stores for people to try one on and learn more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Connected wirelessly to an iPhone, the Apple Watch isn't meant to replace the phone, but rather provide tidbits of information readily while the phone is in a pocket or purse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>There's no keyboard, so searches and messages are done by voice dictation or the selection of a canned response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>You can also send doodles and emoji.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>David Lubarsky, a Fairfield, Connecticut, photographer, loves that he can get "basic information, quick" and avoid staring at Facebook on the phone all day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>It lets him see texts, emails, calendar appointments and baseball scores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"Your wrist doesn't necessarily twist to the right position to the scanner so it's pretty awkward," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Apple Watch also doesn't always provide the right information at the right time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The watch version of one transit app offers bus schedules for your saved locations - even if they are far away - rather than the stops closest to you at the moment, as the phone app does.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>As for message notifications, it's great when it's from someone you want to hear from - but annoying when it's not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>It'll take time for apps to anticipate what users need most.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Apps will get better when Apple updates the watch's software this fall to permit more "native" apps - those that aren't just extensions of phone apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Some apps could even work without the phone nearby, including games, audio recorders and tools that analyze golf swings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Apple also needs to ensure that the watch gets the types of essential "killer apps" that propelled the iPhone into an extension of ourselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>For now, it's sometimes easier to just pull out the phone, and there's no app you absolutely need the watch for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>With phones, you now have maps, cameras and other essentials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>It might be hard to remember, but the first iPhone in 2007 was just a little more than a phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Apps from outside companies didn't come until Apple launched its app store the following year - with just 500 apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Now, it has more than a million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>At first, iPhone apps were dumbed-down versions of websites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Now many apps, such as Instagram, do more than what's possible over Web browsers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Apple Watch doesn't subject owners to ridicule the way Google Glass had, yet it's still, in essence, a computer on your wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Yes, the Apple Watch comes in multiple sizes, materials and bands - 54 configurations in all - and other companies sell additional bands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>But the watch isn't stylish enough for everyone and won't match every outfit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>The watch could ultimately be more than just a Rolex for the tech-savvy set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>But for that to happen, Apple needs to show how the benefits of wearing a watch outweigh the hassles of wearing a watch.</td></tr>
