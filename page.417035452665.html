<h3>U.S. forces kill ISIS leader in eastern Syria raid</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said Saturday that commandos from U.S. special operations forces killed a senior Islamic State militant leader and captured his wife during a night raid Friday in eastern Syria in a town called al-Amr.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The leader, known as Abu Sayyaf, was involved in the Islamic State's military operations and helped direct the group's' illicit oil, gas and financial operations, Carter said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Pentagon said no U.S. personnel were killed or injured during the operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The military's intent was to capture Sayyaf, but he was killed when he "engaged" U.S. forces, Carter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The commandos captured Umm Sayyaf, his wife, who the Pentagon suspects is also a member of the Sunni militant group and "may have been complicit in what appears to have been the enslavement of a young Yezidi woman rescued last night."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The raid marks an escalation of the multipronged U.S. campaign against the Islamic State, also known by the acronyms ISIS and ISIL, now plodding toward its 11th month in Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The U.S. military has conducted raids inside war-torn Syria before on missions to rescue American hostages, but not to target high-value leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The operation represents another significant blow to ISIL, and it is a reminder that the United States will never waver in denying safe haven to terrorists who threaten our citizens, and those of our friends and allies," Carter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I thank the extraordinary men and women in uniform who executed this complex and challenging mission, along with all those who supported it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The White House said Umm Sayaaf was being held by the U.S. military in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bernadette Meehan, White House spokeswoman, said President Obama authorized the operation as soon as sufficient intelligence was gathered and he had received the "unanimous recommendation" of his national security team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This operation was conducted with the full consent of Iraqi authorities and, like our existing airstrikes against ISIL in Syria, consistent with domestic and international law," she said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Islamic State supporters on Twitter identified the leader as "Abu Sayyaf Al-Tunisi," a nom de guerre signifiying he had Tunisian origins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A Syrian pro-government television channel claimed the Syrian army was responsible for the operation, reporting that the "oil minister in the terrorist Daesh organization Abu Al-Tayum Al-Saudi" was killed along with 40 other fighters in "a unique operation by a unit of our [Syrian army] forces in the Al-Omar oil field."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The head of a rebel brigade operating in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor said Abu Sayyaf was in charge of both the oil and economy ministries for the Islamic State and "had great importance in the circles of" the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Abu Sayyaf had been establishing for more than six months the Finance and Economics ministry ... and he knew all that the organization owned in terms of funds and especially oil and gas resources," Abu Zainab Hashimi, whose Righteousness Brigade is battling both the Syrian government and Islamic State, said in a tweet Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The killing of commanders from Daesh and capturing others is a very strong message to many sides," he tweeted, using the common Arabic name for Islamic State.</td></tr>
