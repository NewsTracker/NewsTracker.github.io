<h3>German business confidence post better-than-expected increase as lower euro helps economy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN - A closely watched survey is showing a bigger-than-expected increase in German business confidence as managers in Europe's biggest economy take a brighter view of its outlook for the next six months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Ifo institute said Wednesday its monthly confidence index rose to 107.9 points for March from 106.8 in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was the fifth consecutive rise, and better than economists' forecast of an increase to 107.3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Managers' view of their current situation improved in line with expectations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Their brightening outlook for the next half-year exceeded predictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>German exports have been buoyed by the depreciating euro and domestic demand also is in good shape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>ING-DiBa economist Carsten Brzeski said it appears the European Central Bank's stimulus efforts could "enable the German economy to extend its golden cycle without any new reforms."</td></tr>
