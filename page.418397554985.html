<h3>Spotify: will it be able to keep its users off Apple Music?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Spotify: will it be able to keep its users off Apple Music?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Users have been able to explore Apple Music for more than a week now, but there is still the best part of three months until the Californian company knows how many people are willing to pay for its service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Should Spotify be worried?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Spotify&#x2019;s recent announcement that it had doubled the number of its paying customers over the last year came just days after its Silicon Valley rival announced the launch of Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>How worried should Spotify be?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Will it be able to keep up its growth rate &#x2013; or even hold onto its users?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Apple Music is free to use for the first three months, which means Apple won&#x2019;t have data on how many paying subscribers it has until at least October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It&#x2019;s worth noting that chief executive Tim Cook said in April 2014 that there are 800m iTunes accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He did not specify how many are active or used for music, but he did point out that most have credit card information already attached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>So far, Spotify has been better than Apple at converting its users to paying customers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Almost a third, or 31pc, of Spotify users have paid for a music streaming service in the last month, compared to 22pc of iTunes users, according to data from the market research firm Global Web Index (GWI).</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>However, there is potential for Apple to steal those customers from its Swedish rival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some 50pc of Spotify users also use iTunes, which means that half of Spotify&#x2019;s customer based is already familiar with Apple and its music products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>&#x201c;To overtake Spotify, Apple would need to convert just half of its existing regular iTunes users into Apple Music subscribers,&#x201d; said Jason Mander, head of trends at GWI.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Additionally, GWI found that 26pc of iTunes users also use Spotify, which suggests that people who already buy music from Apple are interested in streaming music, accessing playlists and discovering new artists, which they will now be able to do without leaving Apple &#x2013; although they won&#x2019;t be able to do so without paying, which is a perk they enjoy on Spotify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Stockholm-based company is well aware of its strengths in this competition, and plans to email its US customers urging those who pay for its services via iTunes to switch to a direct purchase through Spotify, saving a $3 monthly surcharge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Google is trying to dominate this space too and this week launched a free, ad-supported limited version of its music streaming player, which usually costs $9.99 per month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Spotify executive Jonathan Forster recently told the Telegraph that Apple&#x2019;s foray into streaming &#x201c;validates&#x201d; what Spotify has been doing for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But it remains to be seen whether that pat on the back will be worth it if Spotify can&#x2019;t hold its claim on the music market.</td></tr>
