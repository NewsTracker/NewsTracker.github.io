<h3>Britain's richest woman Kirsty Bertarelli upsets neighbours with plans for mega basement</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When it came to extending the former Miss UK's London home, however, excavating a vast two-storey subterranean extension seemed the perfect solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But neighbours in the exclusive street have been left feeling angry - even undermined - by the plan to create a family home for her, husband Ernesto, a Swiss businessman, and their three children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They had raised concerns about the excavation possibly harming the property and adjoining buildings, and about the noise and upheaval caused by the work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Adding to their ire, the council is to restrict such developments by the end of the year because of the disruption they cause - but the Bertarellis got their application in just in time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Planners at Westminster City Council this week approved the application, which will add a dining room, family room and cinema area on one of its levels and a kitchen, gym and laundry area on another.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sketches show this would virtually double the size of the house in Belgravia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Staffordshire-born Mrs Bertarelli, 43, who was 17 when she was Miss UK and also runner-up to Miss World, is the richest woman in Britain, worth nearly 9.75billion thanks to her marriage to Ernesto, 49, a Harvard-educated biotechnology tycoon, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They bought the Victorian house 15 years ago for 5.5million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Architects Boundary Space said the 'double decker' basement is required because the house is no longer big enough for the family, who divide their time between London and homes in Geneva and Gstaad, Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The upgrade will turn it into a 'modern family home with appropriate facilities'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dubbed 'iceberg homes', such extensions are the fashionable but controversial solution for rich residents with limited space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber, Nicole Kidman and Roman Abramovich are among those who have all extended underground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some homes on the Bertarellis' mews, one of the most affluent areas of the capital, already have basements, but several neighbours had instructed lawyers to fight the latest proposal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While it will be the third property to have a basement, the Bertarellis would be the first to excavate to two storeys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Locals were also worried that the basement might be used as a recording studio - Mrs Bertarelli co-wrote girl band All Saints' worldwide smash Black Coffee and released her own album last year - although the plans, approved on Tuesday, show otherwise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>One neighbour who wanted to remain anonymous said: 'Some of the owners around here are absolutely apoplectic about what's in the pipeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>These kinds of developments cause huge disruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>'In the past few years there has already been one double basement conversion and a single basement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There will be hardly any earth left eventually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'The houses were never intended to be enormous family homes and the street is just about wide enough to fit two cars down it side-by-side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>'They are obviously going to spend a huge amount on a place they hardly live in, it's staggering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>According to the architects who designed the project, the 'double decker' basement is required because the house is not big enough for the couple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The planned upgrade, which will apparently take three years to complete, will turn it into a 'modern family home with appropriate facilities', they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In a report considered by the council, it emerged that there had been 'a large number of objections' from residents in the mews, who were concerned the basement may be used as recording studios.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>John Walker, the Wesminster City Council's operational director of development planning said in a report: 'There have been a large number of objections from other residents within the mews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>'Concern has been raised by residents that the use of the basements has not been specified, and that they might be used as recording studios.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>'Iceberg' homes became an increasingly popular way for the rich and famous to expand their homes, without flouting planning restrictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea became the first local authority in the country to introduce restrictions on the controversial subterranean developments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>If the couple lived just a few streets away, their plans would not have been approved because of the ban on 'excessive' two storey extensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Westminster City Council is to introduce a similar policy to limit the size of basement extensions by the end of this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Speaking about the approved plan, council spokesman Nick Thompson said: 'This application was approved by committee on Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Planning permission was granted with conditions that the excavation work can be carried out only between 8am and 6pm Monday to Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Nobody was at the Bertarellis' home for comment yesterday.</td></tr>

<h3>Obama banters with Kimmel, reflects on Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>After enduring the routine - in which celebrities read hostile Twitter comments about themselves - Obama told Kimmel, "You should see what the Senate says about me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The president also joked about the perks and restrictions he faces, revealing that he's not allowed to use cellphones that have recorders in them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(Hence his ever-present BlackBerry.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He also noted that he can visit the dentist in the White House basement but doesn't text and can't drive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kimmel asked if that was because you have to have a birth certificate to get a driver's license.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Obama - whom Kimmel introduced as the "first Kenyan-born Muslim Socialist ever elected president" - deadpanned that Kenyans "drive on the other side" of the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>With Sean Penn waiting in the wings, Obama said he was quite familiar with Penn's 1982 coming-of-age comedy "Fast Times at Ridgemont High."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I lived it," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I didn't just see it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kimmel spared the president from questions about the latest controversy involving the Secret Service - although Kimmel's security guard and sidekick, Guillermo Rodriguez, dressed in a full Secret Service getup of dark suit and sunglasses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The glasses, Kimmel joked, were simply hiding a hangover: "Secret cerveza."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Obama's appearance on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" fulfilled a commitment the White House made after he had to postpone an appearance last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>During a more subdued segment, Obama reflected on Wednesday night's shooting of two police officers in racially tense Ferguson, Missouri, just days after he had delivered a speech on racial healing in Selma, Alabama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"What had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and was worthy of protest, but there was no excuse for criminal acts," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Whoever fired those shots should not detract from the issue - they are criminals, they need to be arrested. And then what we need to do is make sure that like-minded, good-spirited people on both sides - law enforcement, who have a terrifically tough job, and people who understandably don't want to be stopped and harassed just because of their race - that they are able to work together to come up with some good answers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>After the "Kimmel" taping, Obama attended a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at the Santa Monica home of Chris Silbermann, president of ICM Partners, one of the top talent agencies in Hollywood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The event was closed to the press, but a Democratic official said the event attracted about 25 people who each paid up to $33,400.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Friday, Obama is flying to Phoenix to hold a roundtable event on veterans' health care.</td></tr>
