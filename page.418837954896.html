<h3>Mexico wins 7th Gold Cup title with 3-1 victory over Jamaica (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Andres Guardado scored again, with no penalty kick needed this time, and his teammates finally managed some goals, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mexico ensured the final wouldn't come down to any calls in the final minutes with a 3-1 victory over upstart Jamaica for the CONCACAF Gold Cup title Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Guardado had his fourth goal of the knockout rounds, and Jesus Corona and Oribe Peralta also scored as El Tri won its seventh Gold Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was a convincing performance for coach Miguel Herrera and his team after some shaky play and contentious moments in the previous two games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jamaica had made a rousing run to the final, stunning the U.S. in the semis to become the first Caribbean nation to reach the Gold Cup's championship match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And the Reggae Boyz looked as though they belonged in the opening minutes, keeping the pressure on Mexico with several promising scoring chances but never putting a shot on goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But then El Tri started to find the gaps in the defense, and a yellow card for Jamaica helped lead to Mexico's first goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Reggae Boyz hadn't trailed since early in the second half of its Gold Cup opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mexico, which already held the record for most Gold Cup titles, is 7-1 in finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>El Tri will face the U.S., the 2013 Gold Cup champ, on Oct. 9 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, for CONCACAF'S spot in the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''We won a game today, but we don't accomplish our goal yet,'' Herrera said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The only way Mexico had been able to score in the knockout rounds before Sunday was on penalty kicks, all three by Guardado.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>And two of those came on late, questionable calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Against Costa Rica in the quarterfinals, a scoreless game was moments from going to a shootout when Guardado converted his penalty in the final minute of extra time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mexico had been the better team that day, but that wasn't the case in the semifinals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Down to 10 men, Panama was on the verge of victory when a disputed hand ball set up a penalty for Guardado in second-half stoppage time, and he scored on another for the winner in extra time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mexico had gone 272 minutes since one of its players scored on anything other than a penalty when Guardado put El Tri ahead for good Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Jonathan dos Santos found Paul Aguilar out wide on a free kick, and Aguilar crossed it to Guardado, whose left-footed volley made it 1-0 in the 31st minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Guardado, voted top player of the tournament, had also been the last Mexico player to score on anything other than a penalty with his goal in the 88th minute against Trinidad and Tobago in the final group stage match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Any chance of a Jamaica comeback quickly evaporated after halftime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Just over a minute in, Jesus Corona, who had failed to convert two good chances in the first half, stole the ball from Michael Hector and pushed forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The 22-year-old forward slid his left-footed shot from the edge of the area under the legs of Wes Morgan for a 2-0 lead in the 47th minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Corona was selected top young player of the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Another mistake by Hector in the 61st minute put Mexico up 3-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He whiffed on an attempted clearance, and the ball went right to Peralta for an easy goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Shortly after, Guardado came off to a thunderous ovation from the pro-Mexico crowd of 68,930 at Lincoln Financial Field, home of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''We really managed the game in the correct way,'' Herrera said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Darren Mattocks scored in the 80th minute to pull the Reggae Boyz within 3-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A magical tournament over in defeat, Jamaica coach Winfried Schaefer proudly held out the medal hanging around his neck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''For me, this is not the silver, this is gold,'' he said.</td></tr>
