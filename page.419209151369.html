<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google to adopt new holding structure under name 'Alphabet' Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google Inc. is changing its corporate structure to separate its search, YouTube and other Web companies from its research and investment divisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Alphabet will be the name of what will effectively be a new holding company, the Web company said in a blog post Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It will include Google Inc. and Calico, a separate unit that includes Google Ventures, Google Capital, Google X and other subsidiaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Larry Page will be Alphabet's chief executive officer, while co-founder Sergey Brin will be president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ruth Porat will be chief financial officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sundar Pichai, Page's deputy, will be promoted to become CEO of Google Inc., which generates the bulk of Google's $60-billion (U.S.) in annual revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Google is adopting this structure in order to make clearer the difference between its main business and longer-term endeavours, as Page and Brin take on more strategic roles, while leaving operational management to trusted deputies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We've long believed that over time, companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes," Page wrote in the post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Shares of Google fell less than 1 per cent to $663.14 at Monday's close in New York.</td></tr>
