<h3>Hillary Clinton admits mistake over emails</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Her email practices have raised questions about whether she fully complied with federal laws requiring government officials to preserve written communications involving official business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Republicans have said Mrs Clinton avoided transparency and committed an ethical lapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The controversy has upended her careful blueprint for the rollout of her 2016 presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination, Mrs Clinton had planned to spend March touting her work on women's issues and giving a handful of paid speeches before announcing her candidacy in early April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She tried to stick to that plan but as criticism from Republicans mounted and Democratic allies started publicly pushing her to address the matter, her team hastily arranged Tuesday's brief news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I fully complied by every rule I was governed by," Mrs Clinton said in a 20-minute news conference that marked her first comments on the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The former secretary of state described her decision to rely exclusively on her private account as a matter of convenience and a way to avoid carrying two devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She said she had not used her personal email to discuss any classified information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Looking back, it would have been better to use two separate phones and two separate email accounts," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mrs Clinton said her server would remain private.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She said she had exchanged 60,000 emails, half of which were personal and were discarded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I had no reason to save them," Mrs Clinton said of the personal emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She described the destroyed communications as ones related to her daughter's wedding, her mother's funeral, her yoga routine and other matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Everything that would be in any way connected to work is now in possession in the State Department," Mrs Clinton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She broke her silence shortly after delivering remarks at a women's empowerment event at the United Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She then made her way to a nearby hallway where dozens of reporters and photographers were awaiting her first formal news conference since leaving the State Department in early 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Before the question-and-answer session, Mrs Clinton's only comment on the matter had been a late-night tweet last week saying she wanted the State Department to the release her emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She served as the nation's top diplomat throughout President Barack Obama's first term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In late 2014, nearly two years after she left the administration, she turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department in response to an agency request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The department says it will take several months to review the material.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that once the review is complete, the emails will be posted online for the public to see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Passages revealing anything from trade secrets to sensitive national security information could be redacted, in keeping with Freedom of Information Act guidelines.</td></tr>

<h3>Dozens escape ISIS jail in northern Syria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and activist Bari Abdelatif, who is from the town where the escape occurred but has fled to Turkey, said Kurdish fighters captured by ISIS in recent months were amongst the escapees on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The militants went house-to-house and set up checkpoints around the northern town of Al-Bab, searching for those who fled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The prisoners took the opportunity to escape when clashes erupted between rival militant groups, said Bari Abdelatif, an activist from al-Bab who is now based in Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There are checkpoints everywhere," Abdelatif said of the situation in the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said he was in contact with residents and added that ISIS fighters were driving through town streets and calling on people over loudspeakers to hand over any prisoners they were hiding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Observatory said the extremists were able to recapture some of those who fled but did not provide details or numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Al-Bab sits less than 30 miles south of Syria's border with Turkey, and has thus become a gateway for militants crossing the border -- in both directions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The jail break on Tuesday came on the heels of reports that a group of ISIS defectors being held at a separate jail in the area had attempted to escape and run for the border over the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>According to accounts online, that attempt ended with about five of the defectors being shot and the rest being recaptured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>ISIS captured about a third of Syria and a third of neighboring Iraq last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the past months, the group has been defeated in some areas, including the Syrian border town of Kobani and several surrounding villages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Across the border in Iraq, ISIS was being fought on several fronts by a rag-tag alliance of government forces, Kurdish fighters, Iranian-backed Shiite militias, and Sunni tribesmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>An Iraqi official said Tuesday that state-allied forces had managed to wrest control of another small town on the outskirts of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>ISIS has held Saddam Hussein's hometown since the summer, but is being increasingly encircled by the Iraqi forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Meanwhile, as CBS News correspondent Holly Williams reported Tuesday, Kurdish fighters battling ISIS in nearby Kirkuk province said they were clawing back significant territory from the extremists with the help of U.S.-led airstrikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The U.S. military is not playing any role in the fight for Tikrit, which is being viewed as a major test of the Iraqi government forces and their allies on the ground ahead of the larger anticipated battle for Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, which ISIS also captured in the summer.</td></tr>
