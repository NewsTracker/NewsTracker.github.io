<h3>James Holmes trial set to begin in 'Dark Knight' massacre [Video]</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CENTENNIAL, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>- Colorado's long-awaited cinema massacre trial will begin on Monday with jurors asked to decide whether gunman James Holmes was insane when he killed a dozen moviegoers in 2012, or a calculating mass murderer who deserves execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Public defenders trying to spare the life of the one-time neuroscience graduate student, and prosecutors seeking the death penalty, are set to present their opening statements in a courtroom on the outskirts of Denver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Holmes, 27, pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to killing 12 people and wounding 70 inside a crowded midnight screening of the Batman film "The Dark Knight Rises."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He was armed with a handgun, shotgun and semiautomatic rifle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour has said he expects the trial to take four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Lawyers for Holmes, who is charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder, concede he was the lone gunman but have said the Southern California native was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he plotted and carried out the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While prosecutors will invoke gruesome images from the crime scene that they outlined in a preliminary hearing in 2013, the crux of their case is to prove Holmes was sane at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He has undergone two court-ordered sanity examinations since his arrest that have produced many hours of video and piles of documents, all sealed by the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>According to court papers, they provided conflicting results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Until that evidence is presented in court, lawyers for both sides will likely use the two hours allotted to them on Monday afternoon to explain how they will go about proving their cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Former Colorado prosecutor Bob Grant said the government must lay out for jurors the horror of the July night when Holmes, dressed in a gas mask, helmet and body armor, lobbed a teargas canister into the screening at Aurora's Century 16 multiplex, then opened fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Holmes appeared in court days after the rampage looking disoriented, and with his hair dyed orange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"They will try to put the jury in those theater seats," said Grant, who prosecuted the only death-row inmate executed in Colorado in nearly 50 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Holmes, who graduated with honors from the University of California, Riverside, has no criminal record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He had been courted by neuroscience doctoral programs, but withdrew from a graduate program at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus before the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Holmes' public defenders will focus throughout the trial on his mental state, said longtime Colorado criminal defense lawyer Mark Johnson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The defense theme from the get-go will be that as a civilized society, we don't put mentally ill people to death," Johnson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Holmes has been hospitalized at least twice since his arrest, according to his lawyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Once he was treated for an apparent self-inflicted head injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Another time he was taken to a Denver psychiatric ward where his lawyers said he was held "frequently in restraints" for several days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Colorado prosecutors rarely seek the death penalty, and the state has just three inmates on death row.</td></tr>
