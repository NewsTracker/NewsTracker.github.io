<h3>White House Notebook: Kenya says it's no terror hotbed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>President Barack Obama reflects as he participates in a wreath laying ceremony, Saturday, July 25, 2015, in Nairobi, at Memorial Park in honor of the victims of the deadly 1998 bombing at the U.S. Embassy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Obama's visit to Kenya is focused on trade and economic issues, as well as security and counterterrorism cooperation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - What happens when an American president invites his African relatives to dinner at a Nairobi hotel?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A lot of family members show up - more, perhaps, than he even knew he had.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The day after dining with about three dozen relatives here, Obama reflected on the time they spent together "just catching up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said some of the more distant relatives were people he'd never met before, despite visiting Kenya twice in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chuckling, he recalled the "lengthy explanations" about how one relative or another was connected to the Obama clan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I think the people of Kenya will be familiar with the need to manage family politics sometimes in these extended families," Obama said with a knowing grin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>With a hint of frustration, Obama said he had told his family how sorry he was that his ability to spend quality time with them on this visit was so limited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Logistical constraints and security precautions prevented Obama from visiting Kogelo, the village where his father lived and is buried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But Obama said once he leaves office and is a private citizen, he'll have a better opportunity to reconnect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The next time I'm back, I may not be wearing a suit. The first time I came here, I was in jeans and a backpack," Obama said, recalling his first trip to Kenya nearly 30 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He may also bring back with him a few relatives of his own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Obama said he plans to return with first lady Michelle Obama and his daughters, Sasha and Malia, after leaving the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They have great love for this country and its people," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Kenyans eager to have their country in the spotlight during President Barack Obama's visit have been irked by a news report describing the East African nation as a "hotbed of terror."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Kenyans quickly mobilized a Twitter campaign using the hashtag #SomeoneTellCNN to correct what many here have called an exaggeration by the television network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>President Uhuru Kenyatta even joined in, telling attendees at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit that they will find Kenya to be "a hotbed of vibrant culture, spectacular natural beauty, and a wonderful people with infinite possibility."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The crowd laughed and applauded at his remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kenya has struggled to contain the threat from al-Shabab militants based in neighboring Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Al-Shabab, a group linked to al-Qaeda, has conducted major attacks in Kenya, including the 2013 attack on Nairobi's Westgate mall and an April attack in Garissa town that killed nearly 150 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>CNN later added an editors' note to its story on its website that read: "The headline and lead of this article has been recast to indicate the terror threat is a regional one."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A CNN spokeswoman said the network had no further comment aside from the editors' note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Kenyan troops are deployed in Somalia to counter al-Shabab, and the United States has carried out drone strikes against suspected militants there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Obama's first full day in Africa came with a solemn reminder of the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In between meetings in Nairobi, Obama placed a red-and-white wreath at the site of the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy, bowing his head for a moment before studying the names of the victims etched into a brick wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He was joined at the site by his national security adviser, Susan Rice, who was the top U.S. diplomat to Africa at the time of the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Extremists simultaneously attacked the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7, 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Kenya attack killed more than 200 Kenyans and 12 Americans at the embassy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Thousands were injured, including Julie Ogoye, a Kenyan government worker, who was sitting at her desk when the explosion occurred.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>She suffered grievous injuries in the attack and has long questioned whether the United States will provide financial compensation to her and other victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I just want to know what his view is on the issue," Ogoye said of Obama on Saturday.</td></tr>
