<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mohammed Soltan, the son of a prominent member of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, was arrested in August 2013, when security forces came looking for his father at his house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They didn't find the father at the time, but arrested him instead, Soltan's family said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 27 year old been on a hunger strike over his detention for more than 14 months and his health is rapidly deteriorating, his family said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>In a statement after Soltan's sentencing, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo said it remained "gravely concerned" about him and the outcome of his case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We will continue to monitor his case closely and to provide him with all possible support," the embassy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"His health and well-being remain of particular concern and remain a top priority to us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The case is rooted in violence that swept the country after the military-led ouster in 2013 of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, a Brotherhood leader, whose supporters set up protest camps in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Security forces violently dispersed the sit-ins in August 2013, killing hundreds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In retaliation, many police stations and churches came under attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Since Morsi's ouster, Egypt has faced international criticism for conducting mass trials with judges issuing severe sentences.</td></tr>
