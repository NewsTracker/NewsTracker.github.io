<tr><td>5</td><td>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Apple's new music service is a valiant effort to catch up in the emerging business of offering unlimited music on demand for a monthly price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Apple Music feels like an attempt to take on every competitive app from Pandora to Spotify to YouTube and advance the idea of online radio at the same time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As a result, Apple Music feels crowded with features and buttons - unusual for a company known for promoting simplicity and ease of use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And as much as Apple Music tries to suit my personal tastes, I find many of its recommendations off-base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple Music is several services in one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>- The core is an on-demand music streaming service like Spotify with a similar price tag - $10 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>You can pick any of millions of songs to play over Wi-Fi or your cellular connection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>You don't own the songs, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Although you can download them for offline playback, access disappears once you stop paying (of course, after the generous 90-day trial period ends).</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's like renting rather than owning music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>- Apple Music is also a giant song recommendation machine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A "For You" section offers playlists created by staff acquired when Apple bought Beats last year for $3 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It's meant to reflect your iTunes purchases and preferences you make using animated bouncing bubbles, though I found the choices limiting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A "New" tab features new music, videos and yet more playlists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>- Then there's the "Radio" tab, which debuts not only Apple's new 24/7 online radio station, Beats1, but contains several stations specializing in various genres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>These are like playlists, but you can't see all the songs that are up next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>- A "Connect" channel offers a running stream of photos, videos and other content provided by artists for fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The area feels empty, probably because not many musicians have participated yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>- One is Beats1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The concept of a radio station taken online and delivered to mobile devices in 100 countries around the world is refreshingly simple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Hosted by Zane Lowe in Los Angeles, Julie Adenuga in London and Ebro Darden in New York, Apple is presenting three tastemakers whom I'm just getting to know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>They play music and conduct interviews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Live listening is fun, and I can switch when I want more control over listening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>- Siri, Apple's ever-evolving digital assistant, can now take voice commands and launch music immediately, even responding to relatively complex commands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Ask it to "Play the top songs from 1973," and you'll get that year's top 25, including "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In fact, if Apple Music had only these two features, I'd feel satisfied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Recommendations sound great, but they get overwhelming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Presented with dozens of options, the app turns back into a record store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>I just want the app to say, "You like this? Then listen to this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Pandora does this well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>There's value to a playlist like "Bruce Springsteen: Deep Cuts," compiled of worthwhile Boss songs that somehow never get played on the radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But the human compilers are presented as faceless entities like "Apple Music Rock."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>This feels impersonal and, to me, gets in the way of connecting with the artists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Apple Music launched June 30 on iPhones and iPads as part of the free iOS 8.4 update.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>It ships with the new iPod Touch released Wednesday, though the previous model can get the update.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>A new Music app replaces Apple's online radio service, iTunes Radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Apple Music is on Mac and Windows computers through the iTunes app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>An Android version and integration with Sonos wireless speakers are coming this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The service benefits from being featured prominently on Apple's mobile devices, but I'm not sure that will be enough for people to switch from another service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>If you've already spent time creating playlists on Spotify, for instance, you're not going to want to start over on Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Apple has a better chance at luring people new to music streaming, especially those who regularly buy songs on iTunes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Apple Music is now the default organizer of all tunes people have saved to iPhones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>When people venture away from their personal purchases in "My Music" and explore playlists and other offerings, they might save some songs to personal libraries, where subscription-only music is commingled with purchased downloads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Keeping up with the subscription could be worth it to keep what's in one's personal library intact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Apple Music is mainly a deal for people who spend more than $120 on music annually, which is about double the average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>However, there are also plenty of things Apple Music offers for free such as Beats1, genre-based radio stations and the ability to follow artists on Connect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>It's no doubt difficult to encapsulate the world of music in a product that aims to mold itself to millions of different tastes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>But we've come to rely on Apple to address these very vexing problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Usually it does so in a way that feels less cluttered.</td></tr>
