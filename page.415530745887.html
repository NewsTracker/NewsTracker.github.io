<h3>UN investigators sharing Syria war crimes findings with European authorities</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The move could pave the way for perpetrators of killings, torture and atrocities on all sides to be brought to account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The aim is to sidestep the U.N. Security Council, where Russia and China have prevented abuse cases being sent to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for prosecution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Paulo Pinheiro, chairman of the United Nations' commission of inquiry, urged national authorities to contact the independent investigators who have compiled five confidential lists over nearly four years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Pinheiro and his team, which includes former U.N. war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, said last month they planned to publish names of suspects and push for new ways to bring them to justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But it stopped short on Tuesday of releasing the lists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We can best aid the pursuit of justice at this time through targeted disclosure. We will share names and information about specific alleged perpetrators with state prosecution authorities that are preparing cases to be heard before a competent and impartial judiciary," Pinheiro told the Human Rights Council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Karen Koning AbuZayd, an American expert on the U.N. panel, told reporters: "We have responded to requests about incidents for example by using our data base. Of course it's a large data base...and much more interesting really than a list."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Three European countries have sought cooperation so far, AbuZayd said, declining to be specific.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The U.N. panel had not shared information on any individual perpetrator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Del Ponte said requests for cooperation were "mainly about foreign fighters".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>More than 200,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, which began in 2011 with peaceful protests against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad and mushroomed into civil war that has driven out 3.9 million refugees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The investigators say their lists, kept in a U.N. safe, include military and security commanders and commanders of insurgent groups, and arose from interviews with 3,800 victims and witnesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Syrian Ambassador Hussam Edin Aala rejected what he called the "biased and selective approach" of U.N. investigators and said they had ignored crimes by Islamist insurgent groups.</td></tr>

<h3>Remains in Madrid Are Believed to Be Those of Cervantes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cervantes, often lauded as having written the first modern novel, died in 1616 after requesting burial in a convent in Madrid where, for almost a year, investigators have been searching the subsoil for bones that they now believe to include some of the author's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Everything coincides to lead us to believe that Cervantes is there," a forensics expert, Francisco Etxeberria, said at a news conference in Madrid, Reuters reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The investigators cautioned, however, that it may be impossible to guarantee that the bones are those of the writer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Almudena Garcia-Rubio, an archaeologist, said that there was "no confirmed genetic identification," although DNA tests were being performed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The whereabouts of Cervantes's tomb had been a mystery since the Convent of the Discalced Trinitarians was rebuilt in the late 17th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The remains were finally found below the ground of the crypt of the church, at a depth of about 50 inches in a box that contained bones from 10 adults and five children, according to Fernando de Prato, a historian who led the search for Cervantes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr. de Prato said that the forensic team still faced "a lot of work" to separate the bones, perhaps try to reconstruct the bodies, and perform DNA testing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It would of course have been better to find his remains complete," to establish the identity of Cervantes with certainty, he said, "but I still have the feeling today of having reached the end of a journey."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The team of investigators used infrared cameras, 3D scanners and radar to search the crypt and its alcoves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>During the excavations, the investigators found decayed wood from a coffin with the letters M and C marked out in tacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>(Cervantes's full name was Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The discovery of the coffin was announced in January, but it turned out to contain the remains of a child rather than those of the writer, Mr. de Prato said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Cervantes is most often remembered for "Don Quixote," which gave the world the word quixotic in acknowledgment of its central character and his adventures, including his joust with windmills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The expression "tilting at windmills" also denotes people who take on imaginary adversaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But such recognition as a writer came too late to bring Cervantes any fortune, after a life spent mostly as a soldier - including a five-year spell in captivity after pirates intercepted his naval ship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The discovery of the possible remains comes as Spain and the literary world celebrate the 400th anniversary of the publication of the second volume of "Don Quixote" (the first one was published in 1605).</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The authorities in Madrid are hoping to build a monument within the church to commemorate the writer, with the goal of completing that work by April of next year, the 400th anniversary of his death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on March 18, 2015, on page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Remains Found in Madrid May Belong to Cervantes.</td></tr>
