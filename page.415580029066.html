<h3>Zayn Malik leaves One Direction tour after being signed off with stress</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Zayn has signed off with stress and is flying back to the UK to recuperate," a spokesperson for the band told The Independent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The band wish him well and will continue with their performances in Manila and Jakarta."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 22-year-old singer became the subject of tabloid speculation this week after photographs emerged of him purportedly holding the hand of a partygoer outside a nightclub in Phuket, Thailand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He is currently engaged to Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>News also emerged on Thursday that Malik and bandmate Louis Tomlinson had been ordered to pay $5,000 ( 3,300) in drug bonds each ahead of their stage show in the Philippines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The two singers will immediately forfeit the bond if they are caught using or promoting illegal drugs during their time in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The conditions were "intended to protect the public interest should the band members commit any violation during their stay in the Philippines," Bureau spokesperson Elaine Tan told The Guardian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The request was made after an anti-drugs campaign group contacted the bureau and asked them to investigate Tomlinson and Malik's work permits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The demand came following the emergence of a video of the two appearing to smoke cannabis in the back of a car in Peru on their way to a show last year.</td></tr>
