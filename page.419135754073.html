<h3>Islamic State 'kidnaps 230 Christians' after Syrian town falls</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tens of thousands of Yazidis and Christians have fled for their lives after IS declared a caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Amman: Islamic State militants have captured dozens of Christian families after snatching the regime-held Syrian town of Qaryatain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The extremist group are said by observers to have seized entire families from churches and houses on Wednesday as they gained control after taking three checkpoints in suicide attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As many as 230 people are missing, including followers of the Syriac Orthodox or Syriac Catholic churches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rased News Network, a Facebook page affiliated with Islamic State militants, published this picture showing a militant on a tank captured from Syrian forces in Qaryatain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bishop Matta al-Khoury, secretary of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate in Damascus, said ISIS had used a number of kidnapped residents as human shields against regime air strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Qaryatain, south-west of the ancient city of Palmyra, had a pre-war population of 18,000, including Sunni Muslims and 2000 Syriac Catholics and Orthodox Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Bishop al-Khoury said about 180 Christians were in the town when IS seized control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Islamic State militants carry weapons as they battle against Syrian government forces in Qaryatain in a photo released by Rased News Network on Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The extremists have been targeting the minority Christian community as it spreads its tendrils through war-torn Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In areas where IS and the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front have seized control, churches have been destroyed, crosses smashed, and in some cases, residents have been forced to pay the "jiyza", a religious tax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said many of Qaryatain's Christians had already fled south from Aleppo, seeking refuge in the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Archbishop Bashar Matti Warda, of Erbil, Iraq, left, and Archbishop Jean-Clement Jeanbart, of Aleppo, Syria, speak at a news conference on Tuesday about the plight of persecuted Middle Eastern Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Those abducted were wanted by IS for "collaborating with the regime" and their names were on a list used by the jihadists as they swept through the town, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Forty-five women and 19 children are among those missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>About 45 regime soldiers were killed during the militants' "combing operations" in hills that lie west of the city, a pro-IS agency said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In the nearby government-controlled city of Homs, churches have been overwhelmed as hundreds of people seek sanctuary from the violence in Qaryatain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"They need immediate aid," said Nuri Kino, head of the activist group A Demand For Action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"You never get used to hearing from the priests or the bishops. There is fear in their voices, they are pleading to the world and no one is listening."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The capture of Qaryatain brings IS within 40 kilometres of the strategic Damascus-Homs highway, which acts as the main supply artery connecting the capital to central Syria and the coastal provinces of Tartous and Latakia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It also affords the group potential access to the Qalamoun area, an important mountain range that has been a vital corridor for Syrian rebels into neighbouring Lebanon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Amnesty International called for the release of detainees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The abhorrent abduction in Syria of more than 200 people by Islamic State highlights the dreadful plight of civilians caught up in the conflict in the country," Neil , Amnesty International's Syria researcher, said in a statement on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The international human rights organisation called on Islamic State to "respect the rules of war and immediately release those civilians unharmed".</td></tr>
