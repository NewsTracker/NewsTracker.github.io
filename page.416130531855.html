<h3>Completing Ebola vaccine trials 'a challenge' as epidemic wanes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GENEVA (Reuters) - Falling Ebola cases in West Africa make completing big clinical trials on experimental vaccines a challenge, with the best hope resting on a study in Guinea, the World Health Organization said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>While the waning epidemic is good news for long-suffering populations in the region, it makes it harder for healthcare experts and drug companies to see if vaccines can protect people against the deadly fever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There were only 30 confirmed cases of Ebola reported in West Africa in the past week, the smallest number in nearly a year in the worst ever outbreak of the viral infection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The issue is - can we complete a Phase III trial in humans?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bruce Aylward, who is leading the United Nations health agency's response to Ebola, told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"That will be a challenge."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ebola is receding in Liberia, which reported no cases in the week to April 5, and in Sierra Leone, which reported nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But it is still spreading in western Guinea, including the capital Conakry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Last month, Guinea started testing an experimental Ebola vaccine from Merck and NewLink Genetics on affected communities in Ebola hotspots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The plan is to immunize the high-risk contacts around Ebola patients, thereby creating a "ring of immunity".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>So far, subjects have been vaccinated in seven such rings, with the target being 100, and Aylward said the Guinea study was "the most likely to generate a meaningful answer".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Even if large clinical trials in West Africa fail to produce definitive answers on efficacy, vaccines could still be submitted to regulators using efficacy data from non-human primate experiments, plus proof of safety and immune system response in humans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Other Ebola vaccines are also being developed by GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson, working with Bavarian Nordic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The WHO believes West Africa's Ebola epidemic still poses a threat to other countries, but the risk of it spreading internationally appears to be diminishing.</td></tr>
