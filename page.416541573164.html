<tr><td>12</td><td>There was a little more order on Sunday as rescue teams fanned out across Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Al Jazeera's Simmons also reported that rescuers and medical staff are also making their way to other parts of the country, but the congestion at the airport has slowed down their deployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>International aid groups and governments have sent emergency crews to reinforce those trying to find survivors in Kathmandu, and in rural areas cut off by blocked roads and patchy phone networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Sunday, planeloads of supplies have begun to arrive in the capital, along with doctors and relief workers.</td></tr>
