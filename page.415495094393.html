<h3>Israeli candidates on last day of campaign before election to determine Netanyahu's future</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The moderate opposition, meanwhile, announced a dramatic last-minute machination of its own, removing one of its two joint candidates for prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Netanyahu, who has governed for the past six years and has long been the most dominant personality in Israeli politics, has watched his standing plummet in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Recent opinion polls show his Likud Party lagging behind Isaac Herzog's Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Herzog, who has vowed to revive peace efforts with the Palestinians, repair ties with the U.S. and reduce the growing gaps between rich and poor, confidently predicted an "upheaval" was imminent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Late Monday night, it was announced that Herzog's main partner, former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, had given up an agreement to rotate the prime minister post with him if their alliance wins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was widely thought that the unusual arrangement was driving away voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tuesday's election caps an acrimonious three-month campaign that is widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While his comments Monday appeared to be election rhetoric, they nonetheless put him further at odds with the international community, boding poorly for already strained relations with the U.S. and other key allies if he wins a third consecutive term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The hard-line leader has portrayed himself as the only politician capable of confronting Israel's numerous security challenges, while his opponents have focused on the country's high cost of living and presented Netanyahu as imperious and out of touch with the common man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As Netanyahu's poll numbers have dropped in recent days, he has appeared increasingly desperate, stepping up his nationalistic rhetoric in a series of interviews to local media to appeal to his core base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Netanyahu has also complained of an international conspiracy to oust him, funded by wealthy foreigners who dislike him, and on Sunday night, he addressed an outdoor rally before tens of thousands of hard-line supporters in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The strategy is aimed at siphoning off voters from nationalistic rivals, but risks alienating centrist voters who are expected to determine the outcome of the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Speaking to the nrg news website, Netanyahu said that turning over captured territory to the Palestinians would clear the way for Islamic extremists to take control and attack Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Whoever ignores that is burying his head in the sand. The left is doing that, burying its head in the sand time after time," he said in the video interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>When asked if that means a Palestinian state will not be established if he is elected, Netanyahu replied, "Indeed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was the latest - and clearest - attempt by Netanyahu to disavow his earlier support for Palestinian independence, which he first laid out in a landmark 2009 speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"If we get this guarantee for demilitarization and necessary security arrangements for Israel, and if the Palestinians recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people, we will be willing in a real peace agreement to reach a solution of a demilitarized Palestinian state alongside the Jewish state," he said at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Despite that pledge, two rounds of peace talks have failed and Netanyahu has continued to expand Jewish settlements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Reaching a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict has been a top foreign policy priority for President Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki would only say on Monday that the U.S. will work with whoever wins the Israeli election.</td></tr>
