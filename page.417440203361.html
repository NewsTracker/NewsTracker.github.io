<h3>Supreme Court rejects conviction for Facebook threats</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this Dec. 1, 2014 photo, John P. Elwood, attorney for Anthony D. Elonis, who claimed he was just kidding when he posted a series of graphically violent rap lyrics on Facebook about killing his estranged wife, shooting up a kindergarten class and attacking an FBI agent, speaks to reporters outside the Supreme Court in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Supreme Court on Monday threw out the conviction of a Pennsylvania man convicted of making threats on Facebook, but dodged the free speech issues that had made the case intriguing to First Amendment advocates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for seven justices, said it was not enough for prosecutors to show that the comments of Anthony Elonis would make a reasonable person feel threatened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the court did not specify to lower courts exactly what the standard of proof should be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Elonis was prosecuted under a law banning illegal threats after he posted Facebook rants in the form of rap lyrics about killing his estranged wife, harming law enforcement officials and shooting up a school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Elonis claimed the government had no right to prosecute him if he didn't actually intend his comments to be threatening to others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He argued that his musings were protected by the First Amendment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But the Obama administration said the test is whether the comments would strike fear in a reasonable person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The high court said it was not necessary to reach First Amendment issues in reversing Elonis' conviction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Roberts said the reasonable person standard is "inconsistent with the conventional requirement for criminal conduct - awareness of some wrongdoing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Elonis said he didn't intend to threaten anyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He claimed his posts under the pseudonym "Tone Dougie" were a form of therapy that allowed him to cope with the breakup of his marriage and being fired from his job at an amusement park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>His lawyers said the comments were heavily influenced by rap star Eminem, who has also fantasized in songs about killing his ex-wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But Elonis' wife testified that the comments made her fear for her life and she persuaded a judge to issue a protective order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The government argued that it didn't matter whether Elonis actually intended to threaten anyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>If the comments provoked enough fear and anxiety to make people feel threatened, that was enough to prosecute it as a crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>One post about his wife said, "There's one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you. I'm not going to rest until your body is a mess, soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>After his wife obtained the protective order, Elonis wrote: "Is it thick enough to stop a bullet?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Those and other comments led to his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A jury found Elonis guilty under a law barring interstate communications that contain "any threat to injure the person of another."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He was sentenced to nearly four years in federal prison and was released last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Elonis was arrested again in April for allegedly throwing a pot that hit his girlfriend's mother in the head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Police charged him with simple assault and harassment.</td></tr>
