<h3>Busch grabs elusive Indy victory as comeback continues (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- There was no celebratory burnout - Kyle Busch has done plenty of those the last few weeks - just another big, fat kiss at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Busch's triumphant return following a horrible crash the day before the season-opening Daytona 500 continued Sunday with one of the biggest wins of his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He grabbed an elusive victory at Indy, where Busch won the Brickyard 400 for a weekend sweep at the historic track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Busch missed the first 11 races of the season with a broken right leg and broken left foot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He returned in late May and has won three consecutive Sprint Cup Series races and four of the last five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''Being away for 11 weeks, it was tough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It was pretty hard times,'' Busch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''It was tough to fight through all those things that I had to go through, Samantha had to go through while she was pregnant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She was helping me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>All the steps that we went through to get back into the race car were quite challenging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''But once we've been back, I felt like I just continued right on my stride.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This has been a phenomenal return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Now he has a prestigious Brickyard victory to give him one of NASCAR's elusive crown jewels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His Indianapolis victory ranks alongside his Southern 500 win at Darlington Raceway as the biggest of his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''Maybe I found my happy place,'' Busch said in victory lane when asked if he has found a new perspective since he was injured in a crash the day before the season-opening Daytona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Busch, who also won the second-tier Xfinity Series race Saturday at Indianapolis, moved 23 points away from cracking the top 30 in the standings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>NASCAR granted him a waiver that will make him eligible for the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship should he be ranked inside the top 30 in points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''We're a championship contending team, we just need to be championship eligible,'' Busch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The win for Joe Gibbs Racing was the first Sprint Cup Series victory at Indianapolis for Toyota, which has now won at all 23 active tracks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Toyota has won the last six national series races dating back to Busch's win at Kentucky, and JGR has won four consecutive poles and four consecutive races.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Chevrolet had entered the race on a 12-year winning streak and had won 16 of the 21 Brickyards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The manufacturer also won the Indianapolis 500 in May with Roger Penske driver Juan Pablo Montoya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But Penske was denied his first Brickyard 400 win when Joey Logano finished second to Busch on Sunday in a Ford.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''Geez, I guess Kyle's back,'' Daytona 500 winner Logano said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''It's just so frustrating running second at the Brickyard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Busch knows that all too well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He finished second in two of the previous three Brickyards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Kevin Harvick was third in a Chevrolet, followed by Martin Truex Jr., Busch teammate Denny Hamlin and Clint Bowyer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Matt Kenseth, another Gibbs driver, was seventh, followed by Kurt Busch and Kyle Larson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Penske driver Brad Keselowski rounded out the top 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Jeff Gordon's final Brickyard 400 was a huge bust as an early spin caused considerable damage that eventually sent him to the garage for repairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Gordon, who has a record five victories at Indianapolis, finished 42nd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He's retiring at the end of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>''It was disappointing,'' Gordon said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>''I have had an amazing career here in Indy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The fans have been spectacular.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Two-time Brickyard winner Tony Stewart was strong early but strategy backfired on the Indiana native and he finished 28th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>NASCAR used a track-specific rules package Sunday that was designed to improve the racing on a track that has proven to be incredibly hard to pass at since the heavy stock cars began racing on the Brickyard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>But the low-drag package didn't appear to be much of an improvement as drivers complained all weekend that the turbulence was too strong around their car when they'd close in on another.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>In the end, there were 16 lead changes among six drivers and Harvick, who called Sunday's race ''a science project,'' led a race-high 75 laps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>''I think everybody put in a lot of effort to really try to make everything a lot better, spent a lot of money, but I don't know that we accomplished everything that we were looking to accomplish,'' Harvick said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Aside from the lack of improved competition, the cars were extremely hot inside the cockpit because the aerodynamic package was trapping air inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Busch was one of many drivers physically drained following Saturday's race, and Sunday's race seemed to have the same consequence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>This same rules package is scheduled to be used next month at Michigan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>''I got a huge blister on my foot,'' Logano said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>''I think the extended bumper cover on the back of these things doesn't let the airflow underneath the car like it used to without it, and I think it builds the inside temperature up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>I've got sweat in my eyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>''It's just too hot inside those cars.''</td></tr>
