<h3>Updated: Samsung Galaxy S6 release date: where can I get it?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Samsung Galaxy S6 is official, and it's sporting a fancy metal unibody and glass front and rear - it's quite possibly the best looking Galaxy ever, but perhaps the Galaxy S6 Edge has just stolen that title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In terms of the Samsung Galaxy S6 release date it'll be available on April 10 in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB variants, but pre-orders are now open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>You can now pre-order your Samsung Galaxy S6 online or in one of the firm's dedicated stores, but only in its 32GB capacity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If you're in the market for the 64GB or 128GB Galaxy S6 you'll have to wait, and Samsung hasn't provided a date or price for these models just yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>You've got the choice of four colours (black, white, gold, blue), although only the black, white and gold can currently be pre-ordered with blue "TBC".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 32GB model is 599.99 SIM-free, with the black and white versions landing in hands on April 9, while the gold handset arrives a few days later on April 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Carphone has the Samsung Galaxy S6 up for pre-order too, and there's the choice of picking it up on contract or SIM free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Available in black, white or gold the 32GB Galaxy S6 is priced at 599.99, the 64GB version will see you part with 659.99 while the 128GB comes in at a wallet trembling 739.99.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Meanwhile on contract you'll be able to choose tariffs from O2, Vodafone and EE - with the first two offering tariffs which require no upfront charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Pre-order the Galaxy S6 from Carphone Warehouse and you'll get a free wireless charger (worth 39.99) thrown in to sweeten the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On O2 if you pre-order the Galaxy S6 the bubbly network will throw in a free Fitbit Charge for good measure, with the black and white 32GB models arriving on April 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If you fancy the 64GB version the black model will be available from April 17, while the white and gold options will arrive from May 1, along with the gold 32GB Galaxy S6.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Anyone looking for the 128GB model will be out of luck, as it's not available for pre-order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The headline tariff here is a two year contract at 38 per month with a 99.99 upfront charge, unlimited texts and minutes and 2GB of data, but there are 12 different options to choose from in total.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>You can also pre-order the Samsung Galaxy S6 via EE, with the 4G-centric network recommending its 43.49 per month two year deal with a 49.99 upfront cost for the 32GB handset and 4GB of data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Only the 32GB and 64GB models are available (in black, white and gold) for pre-order here, with the former sporting a 21 day expected delivering and the latter 28 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There are 20 pay monthly plans to choose from in total, but there are all pretty pricey so you may want to shop around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Pre-orders for the Galaxy S6 are also up and running at Vodafone, and you can bag yourself a 32GB, 64GB or 128GB model - there's no restrictions here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There's a choice of 3G and 4G contracts, as well as 12 and 24 month plans, although we'd say you're best going for a two year, 4G tariff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Take our advice and one of your options is a free Galaxy S6 at 48.50 per month with unlimited minutes and texts, 7GB of data and your choice of a 24 month NowTV, Spotify or Sky Sports Mobile TV subscription.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Three will also be stocking the Samsung Galaxy S6 on 24 month contracts with the added benefit of being able to use your phone abroad in 16 countries with no extra cost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Pre-orders open from March 21 for both the 32GB and 64GB versions with an upfront cost of 49.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The 32GB version is available with all you can eat data for 47 a month, 2GB of data for 42 a month or 1GB for 39 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Meanwhile the 64GB version is a little extra at 43 for the 1GB, 46 for the 2GB or 51 a month for the all you can eat data package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The community drive network will also be ranging the Galaxy S6 in its three storage variants and in gold, white and black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Sign up online to be kept up to date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Over on Tesco Mobile you'll be able to bag yourself a free Samsung Galaxy S6 on a range of tariffs, the cheapest of which is a not too shabby price of 36 per month for two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>You'll get 1000 minutes, 5000 texts and 2GB of data for your monthly outlay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>There's no pre-order option at the moment, with Tesco only allowing you to pre-register your interest for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>You'll be able to buy the S6 from April 7.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Virgin Media has confirmed the Samsung Galaxy S6 will be available from its stores and online from April 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The SIM-free pre-order price for the Galaxy S6 over at MobileFun is 599 for the 32GB model - saving you a whole 99p over Samsung's retail price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Meanwhile over on Unlocked-Mobiles the Galaxy S6 is priced slightly lower at 549.98, although you can still only register you interest for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Clove also has a holding page for the Galaxy S6, but again all you can do is register your interest for now.</td></tr>
