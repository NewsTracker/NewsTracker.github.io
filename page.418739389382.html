<h3>Jamaica stuns U.S. menâ€™s team, faces Mexico for Gold Cup title</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATLANTA - The United States had everything on its side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>History. A raucous home crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And, supposedly, the better team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>None of it prevented Jamaica from handing the Americans their biggest upset defeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Reggae Boyz stunned the U.S. with two first-half goals, one off a blunder by goalkeeper Brad Guzan, and held off the Americans for a 2-1 win in the CONCACAF Gold Cup semifinals Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Instead of heading to an expected berth in Sunday's title game at Philadelphia, the Americans will play a day earlier for third place following their first home loss to a Caribbean nation since 1969, to Haiti.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Obviously, the team is disappointed. The fans are disappointed," U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We wanted to play in the big final Sunday."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Darren Mattocks, who plays for the Vancouver Whitecaps in Major League Soccer, put Jamaica ahead with a 31st-minute header directly off a throw-in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Houston Dynamo's Giles Barnes followed five minutes later with a goal on an 18-yard free kick after Guzan was caught outside the penalty area on a routine throw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Other than those two set plays, the Americans dominated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They finished with a 10-3 edge in shots on goal, including eight in the second half, as they furiously charged at Jamaican keeper Ryan Thompson, who plays for the Pittsburgh Riverhounds in the third-tier United Soccer League.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Thompson turned aside every shot but Michael Bradley's goal in the 48th minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"My phone hasn't stopped, as you can imagine," Barnes said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Back in Jamaica, there's got to be a party going on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At the final whistle, the Jamaicans charged onto the field, waving their flag while a few fans saluted the underdog team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A team ranked 76th in the world became the first Caribbean nation to reach a Gold Cup final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mexico 2, Panama 1: Andres Guardado scored two goals on penalty kicks, including the tiebreaker in extra time, and Mexico beat shorthanded and angered Panama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Roman Torres scored on a header early in the second half for Panama, and the 1-0 lead held until Guardado's penalty kick in stoppage time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Panama forward Luis Tejada was ejected for his contact with Mexico's Francisco Rodriguez about 25 minutes into the match.</td></tr>
