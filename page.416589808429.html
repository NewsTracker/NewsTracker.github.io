<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>RIYADH - Saudi Arabia on Tuesday announced the arrest of 93 suspects with ties to the Islamic State group who it says were planning multipronged attacks on the U.S. Embassy, security forces and residential compounds where foreigners live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The list of targets recalls a wave of attacks launched by al-Qaida inside the kingdom from 2004 to 2007, which killed dozens of people, including foreigners, and threatened the stability of one of the world's most important oil-producing nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Saudi Arabia is also home to Islam's holiest sites, in Mecca and Medina.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>He said there have been five Islamic State-related attacks across the kingdom in recent months that have killed 15 civilians and security personnel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But he said Saudis have largely ignored the Islamic State group's calls to take up arms against their government and attack the Shiite minority, security forces and foreigners living in the kingdom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We do have a number of people who do respond to such calls and do try to carry out such terrorist organizations' orders, but these people do not represent the Saudi population, do not represent the 20 million Saudis," he said in remarks to AP a day before the announcement of the arrests, which took place over several months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Al-Turki said the security raids included a cell of 65 people arrested in March who were involved in a plan to target residential compounds and prisons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They also allegedly planned to carry out attacks aimed at creating sectarian strife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>All but two in the cell were Saudi citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Authorities also disrupted a plot for a suicide car bomber to attack the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh after receiving information about the plan in mid-March, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Two Syrians and a Saudi citizen were arrested in relation to the plot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The timing of the alleged attack coincides with a U.S. decision to halt all consular services for a week starting March 15 at the embassy and diplomatic missions in Jiddah and Dhahran over security fears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh is located in a large and heavily guarded compound with other embassies.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>Last week, Saudi Arabia increased security around shopping centers and oil installations for a few days, also in response to security threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Al-Turki said another group of nine Saudis, including one woman, were arrested on suspicion they tried to use social media to lure a military officer into a trap and assassinate him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Other arrests involving alleged Islamic State operatives included a cell of 15 Saudis broken up around New Year's.</td></tr>
