<h3>Shiite militias quit siege of Islamic State in Tikrit over US role</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Al Rashid airbase: Three major Shiite militia groups have pulled out of the fight for Tikrit, immediately depriving the Iraqi government of thousands of their fighters on the ground even as US warplanes readied for an expected second day of airstrikes against the Islamic State there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The militia groups, some of which until recently had Iranian advisers with them, pulled out of the Tikrit fight on Thursday in protest at the US military airstrikes, which began late Wednesday night, insisting that the Americans were not needed to defeat the extremists in Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Together the three groups represent as much as a third of the 30,000 fighters on the government side in the offensive against the so-called Islamic State (also known as ISIS),analysts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Iraqi security forces prepare to attack Islamic State extremist positions in Tikrit on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We don't trust the American-led coalition in combatting ISIS", said Naeem al-Uboudi, the spokesman for Asaib Ahl al-Haq, one of the three groups which said they would withdraw from the front line around Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"In the past they have targeted our security forces and dropped aid to ISIS by mistake", he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>One of the leaders of the biggest militias in the fight, the Badr Organisation, also criticised the US role and said his group, too, might pull out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We don't need the American-led coalition to participate in Tikrit. Tikrit is an easy battle, we can win it ourselves," said Mueen al-Kadhumi, who is one of the Shiite militia group's top commanders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Iraqi security forces prepare to attack Islamic State positions in Tikrit on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We have not yet decided if we will pull out or not", he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Badr Brigade's leader, Hadi al-Ameri, was shown on Iraqi Television leading the ground fight in Tikrit on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The US airstrikes began late Wednesday night and continued for more than eight hours, subsiding at dawn on Thursday, when Iraq's handful of Russian-made fighter jets took over from this base on the outskirts of Baghdad and further bombed Tikrit in a succession of daytime raids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Before starting the airstrikes, US officials demanded that Iranian officials and the militias closest to them to stand aside while other Iraqi forces went in to drive out the last militants in the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Iraqi security forces launch rockets against Islamic State militants on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But a pullout by those militias, especially by the Badr Organisation, would effectively disband the largest and most effective ground force the Iraqi government has been able to field since the invasion by the Islamic State last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The other groups that announced they would boycott the Tikrit operation were Qatab Hizbullah, which like Ashaib Ahl al-Haq is closely aligned and supported by Iran, and the Peace Brigade, the latest name for a militia made of up followers of the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, previously known as the Mahdi army.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Hakim al-Zamily, one of the leaders of the Sadr group, said his group had warned it would pull out of the Tikrit fight if the Americans were brought in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We don't trust the Americans; they have targeted our forces many times in so-called mistakes," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Sadr, whose troops fought bitter battles against the Americans during much of the Iraq war, said his group was pulling out because, in his words, "the participation of the so-called international alliance is to protect ISIS, on the one hand, and to confiscate the achievements of the Iraqis, on the other hand."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Since March 2, Islamic State forces in Tikrit have been under attack by the Iraqi militias, collectively known as the Popular Mobilisation Committees, and regular Iraqi military forces, together numbering more than 30,000 fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The great majority of the fighters were members of the militias.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Some of those fighters, particularly followers of the Badr Organisation, which is closely identified with the Iraqi government's leaders, have so far remained in the fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Still, a much smaller force of Islamic State fighters has been able to hold them off in a few areas of the city for almost four weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In recent days, despite the claims of self-sufficiency made by militia commanders, Iraqi military officials said American airstrikes were needed to break the deadlock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The militias who were withdrawing did not say they were quitting their positions in the Tikrit area altogether, or in adjoining areas of Salahuddin province, just returning to their nearby bases and boycotting the front-line advance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>By 10am on Thursday, the Iraqi jets had carried out four waves of attacks on Tikrit, consisting of up to five jets each from this base, taking over from the US bombers in the coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>As the Tikrit operation continued through Thursday, Staff General Anwer Hamid, the commander of the Iraqi air force, said that for operational reasons, US aircraft would concentrate on night bombing runs, and the Iraqis would continue their daytime sorties.</td></tr>
