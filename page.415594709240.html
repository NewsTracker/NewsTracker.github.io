<h3>Watch the Solar Eclipse</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The best place to see the eclipse was in the Faroe Islands, 200 miles off the coast of Scotland, and in Norway's Svalbard archipelago, which was set to experience a total eclipse, reports the Guardian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Starting in Greenland at sunrise, the eclipse moved in a semicircle northeast, passing over Iceland, and reached the U.K. at around 8:45 a.m. local time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But most of the solar eclipse was expected to go unseen as it crossed over the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Weather permitting, residents in Europe and northern Africa, western Asia and parts of the Middle East were able to enjoy a partial eclipse to varying degrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>St. John's in Newfoundland Canada was expected to see a small part of the eclipse but the rest of North America won't be able to experience it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A solar eclipse can only happen when there is new moon, and Friday's is set to be a supermoon, meaning the moon is the closest point to the earth in its orbit, making it appear much larger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>To complete the trio of celestial events, Friday also marks the spring equinox, the time of year when day and night are of equal length.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If you are lucky enough to observe the full or partial eclipse, experts advise not to look directly at the sun, especially when taking photographs or selfies.</td></tr>
