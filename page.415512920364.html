<h3>Molly Ringwald joins Ally Sheedy to celebrate The Breakfast Club's 30th anniversary?at SXSW festival</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Breakfast Club reunion!</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Breakfast Club followed a bunch of rowdy teens forced to spend a Saturday together in school detention under the guardianship of a villainous principal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy were brought back together to celebrate the iconic 1985 film's 30th Anniversary Restoration on Monday during the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Molly, now 47 and a blonde, was a few shades lighter than her red-haired alter ego Claire Standish, the princess of the group, but youthfully vibrant as ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And Ally, 52, had a savvy sophisticated air about her that resembled nothing like Allison Reynolds, the funny basket case she played in the movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Molly, a mother-of-three, looked bright in a white embellished frock with lace-edged hem as she attended the event held at the Paramount Theatre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sheer stockings and pointy, pink-accented heels added a touch of class while her decolletage was decorated with a single necklace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ally, who has one daughter, Rebecca, from a previous marriage, chose a loose-fitting black dress that fluttered to the ankles, and worn with black leather boots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The actresses had fun posing together arm-in-arm on the red carpet and later took part in a Q&A on stage where they spoke about the film that launched them to stardom three decades ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The anniversary edition Blu-ray is released in the UK on 6th April from Universal Pictures (UK).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Breakfast Club also starred Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall and Paul Gleason as the assistant high school principal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Molly previously expressed her admiration for John Hughes masterpiece to Us Weekly in 2010, saying: 'There's been nothing to replace it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Of course, Molly also starred in John Huges' Sixteen Candles (1984) and Pretty In Pink (1986).</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Judd Nelson, 55, was also on the Today show recently and spoke about The Breakfast Club, telling Guthrie: 'You always hope on every project that it's special, that it will stand the test of time, but you never really know.</td></tr>
