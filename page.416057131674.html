<h3>Greek minister: Evidence for massive German war reparations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's defense minister said his country's government has obtained "stunning evidence" to support its claim that German World War II reparations are worth a massive 278.7 billion euros ($302 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Panos Kammenos said Greece had obtained records held by the U.S. military that review the extent of damage to private and public property during the Nazi occupation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"There is stunning evidence - detailing what (happened) in every village and in every town," Kammenos said in remarks made at the ministry Monday and published Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The evidence is so compelling that it will lead to the reopening of cases, even those that have already gone to court."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The spat over reparations is likely to add to tensions between the two countries over Greece's troubled bailout repayments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The two-month-old government in Athens is struggling to repay debts and draw up a convincing cost-cutting reforms plan that Germany and other creditors want before they pay more rescue loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nazi Germany led the three-year wartime occupation of Greece that saw tens of thousands of people die of starvation under a brutal regime that carried out random executions in response to resistance fighters and destroyed vital infrastructure during its retreat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Sunday, Deputy Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas told a parliament committee that private and state reparation claims from Greece were worth a staggering 278.7 billion euros ($302 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Germany says it has already settled its reparations to Greece in post-war agreements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's economy minister, argued that Greece's new left-led government was attempting to use the reparations issue to influence debt negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"To be honest I think it's dumb," Gabriel said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I think that it doesn't move us forward one millimeter on the question of stabilizing Greece."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Gabriel reasserted that Germany believes the 1990 treaty on German sovereignty formally ends the debate about reparation payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But he said he wasn't in favor of drawing a line under any discussion about Germany's guilt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Germany will have to keep facing the question again and again of whether what it did after 1945 was enough, or whether it still bears some responsibility today," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In this photo taken on Saturday, March 21, 2015, the sculpture of the Doleful Stony Mother stands in front of a wall engraved with the names of victims of the Kalavryta massacre at a memorial site in the town of Kalavryta, western Greece.</td></tr>
