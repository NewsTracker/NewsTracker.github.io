<h3>Ukraine president wants UN peacekeepers to monitor cease-fire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has called for U.N. peacekeepers to be deployed to monitor a cease-fire in war-weary east Ukraine, a proposal that pro-Russia rebels swiftly said would be in breach of a peace deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At an emergency meeting late on Wednesday, Ukraine's national security and defense council approved Poroshenko's request, a clear sign of Ukraine's concerns after pro-Russian rebels seized a strategic town after a cease-fire took effect on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The best format for us is a police mission of the EU," Poroshenko said according to a statement on his website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It will be the most efficient guarantor of security in the situation when the word of peace is not observed either by Russia or by those who are supported by it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ukraine pulled thousands of troops out of the east Ukrainian town of Debaltseve on Wednesday after failing to stop an offensive by Moscow-backed rebels who said the railway hub was not part of last week's cease-fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Thursday, Kiev said 90 of its troops had been captured in the town with 82 still missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As rebel fighters celebrated in the streets of Debaltseve on Thursday, there were hopes that a decisive victory there would finally give the cease-fire a chance to hold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The idea of a U.N. peacekeeping force has been floated before, and many feel it is not workable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>An international force posted along Ukraine's separatist fault line might only serve to further entrench the armed divide and hamper Kiev's efforts to reunite the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>For their part, the rebels denounced Poroshenko's call for peacekeepers, saying their presence would "violate" the cease-fire, negotiated in marathon talks by France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine in the Belarussian capital Minsk late last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This is an actual violation of the package of measures to implement the Minsk agreement," Denis Pushilin, a senior separatist figure, was quoted as saying by Russia's RIA news agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"And so we have a very negative attitude to this. Moreover we are ready to address the heads of state who were guarantors that Ukraine would meet its commitments."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Russia's ambassador to the United Nations was also quoted as saying that Poroshenko's proposal put into doubt Ukraine's resolve to fulfill the Minsk agreements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Meanwhile in Paris, French President Francois Hollande said he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke Thursday with the leaders of Ukraine and Russia about cease-fire violations and their consequences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He did not elaborate.</td></tr>
