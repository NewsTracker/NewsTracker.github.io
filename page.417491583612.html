<h3>More than 10,000 jihadists killed in air strikes against Islamic State, US claims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>More than 10,000 jihadists have been killed in air strikes against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria over a nine-month coalition campaign, the US says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We have seen enormous losses from Daesh [IS], more than 10,000 since the beginning of the campaign and this will end up having an impact," deputy secretary of state Antony Blinken told French radio, using an Arabic acronym for the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A member to Islamic State waves a flag in Raqqa, Syria, last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Blinken was speaking a day after an international conference in Paris in which about 20 representatives of the anti-IS coalition pledged support for Baghdad's plan to claw back territory from the jihadists who have conquered large parts of Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The coalition's strategy has been criticised for relying on air strikes without committing boots on the ground, but Blinken stressed there had been "significant progress".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Islamic State now controls "25 per cent less of Iraq after nine months, a lot of their equipment has been destroyed and many Daesh [IS] members have been eliminated," said Blinken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He nevertheless acknowledged the "resilience" of IS after the coalition had launched about 4000 air strikes on them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In a separate French radio interview, Iraq's ambassador to France, Fareed Yasseen, said the allies had heeded Baghdad's calls for more weapons to combat the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The Americans have promised us and will shortly deliver missiles that will make the difference against these truck bombs ... which made us lose Ramadi," the ambassador told Europe 1 radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The French will be giving us similar weapons, ammunition and we are discussing other co-operation projects."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>More than 10,000 jihadists killed in air strikes...</td></tr>
