<h3>Cristiano Ronaldo scores first free-kick in 31 attempts and more than a year as Real Madrid beat Eibar 3-0 to keep pressure on Barcelona</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ronaldo had taken 31 free-kicks at goal since scoring his last goal, with the strike taking his tally to a league-leading 38 for the season; including matches for Portugal the Ballon d'Or winner had struck 56 free-kicks without finding the net.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Carlo Ancelotti's team pulled to within a point of Barcelona at the top of La Liga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Portuguese sent a bouncing free-kick over the wall and beyond goalkeeper Xabi Irureta in the 21st minute to open the scoring at the Santiago Bernabeu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Manchester United loanee Javier Hernandez doubled the lead 10 minutes later whilst youngster Jese Rodriguez capped the one-sided match in the 83rd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ancelotti was able to give some of his regular bench players a rare start with several first-choice starters rested ahead of the Champions League quarter-final at Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gareth Bale missed the match with a muscle strain with Hernandez starting instead of Karim Benzema.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Keylor Navas had a quiet day in goal replacing Iker Casillas and the team didn't miss midfielders James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos, who served one-match suspensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Madrid's defence even got a boost when Pepe returned from injury as a second-half substitute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ronaldo received some help from Irureta to score his goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Eibar goalkeeper mis-judged Ronaldo's fre- kick and moved out of position, leaving him unable to react in time and stop the ball from bouncing past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Madrid dominated the rest of the way as Hernandez and Rodriguez polished off the victory that kept Eibar in 14th place.</td></tr>
