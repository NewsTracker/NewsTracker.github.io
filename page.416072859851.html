<h3>Apple, Google and Microsoft audited by ATO</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Three major tech companies giving evidence at a Senate inquiry into tax avoidance have confirmed they are being audited by the Australian Taxation Office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Executives from Apple, Google and Microsoft, under questioning at the hearing in Sydney on Wednesday, confirmed they were being investigated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Google Australia managing director Maile Carnegie said the company made $58 million in revenue in 2013, and profits of just more than $46 million, but paid $7.1 million in tax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Earlier, Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan continued to refuse to reveal the identities of a number of companies suspected of avoiding tax by shifting billions of dollars offshore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Committee chairman Sam Dastyari had written to Mr Jordan on Tuesday requesting he reveal the names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Mr Jordan refused, and in a response sent to Senator Dastyari and tabled at the hearing on Wednesday, defended the decision on the grounds that naming the companies would undermine public confidence in the tax system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The treasurer has been consulted about making these PII (public interest immunity) claims, and has endorsed them being made by me as an independent statutory office holder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The grounds of the PII claim are as follows," the letter said.</td></tr>
