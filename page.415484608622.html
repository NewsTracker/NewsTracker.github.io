<h3>France's National Front seen leading local election run-up: poll</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The survey by pollster Ifop for Le Figaro daily sees the National Front (FN) scoring 30 percent of the votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It puts the mainstream conservative UMP - led by ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy - and its center-right UDI ally just behind with 29 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Francois Hollande's Socialists are forecast to win only 19 percent of the vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The normally low-key elections in France's departments will this time be scrutinized for signs that Marine Le Pen's FN has gained enough momentum to reach a runoff round in the 2017 presidential election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It came first in French elections to the European Parliament last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While the FN is unlikely to get large numbers of its officials elected in the local March 30 runoff, leading in the first round would build on its previous successes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hollande's Socialists feared they would lose in the second round but that could happen as early as the first round, Ifop's Jerome Fourquet said, adding that mainstream right-wing parties had been better at crafting pre-election deals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Adding the scores of smaller right-wing parties would give conservatives another five percent in the first round, ahead of the FN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But while other left-wing and far-left parties would bring the left-wing camp a total score of 33 percent, they would individually score below 10 percent and so are unlikely to make it to the second round, Fourquet said in a note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The poll carried out March 11-13 suggested a 54 percent abstention rate, as is usual at this election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Less than a third of those surveyed said they could still change their mind.</td></tr>
