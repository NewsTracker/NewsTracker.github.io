<h3>Review: New 'Three Sisters' adaptation lands at Hayward's Douglas Morrisson Theatre</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Berkeley Repertory Theatre produced Sarah Ruhl's new version in 2011, and David Mamet, Michael Frayn and Lanford Wilson have all had a go at translating it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Now Hayward's Douglas Morrisson Theatre gives us the regional premiere of an adaptation by the provocative playwright Tracy Letts ("Killer Joe," "Bug" and the Pulitzer Prize-winning "August: Osage County").</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Commissioned by Portland's Artists Repertory Theatre, where it premiered in 2009, this version played in Letts' artistic home, Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre Company, in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Billed as a "lean and mean" version, Letts' adaptation is still 2 hours and 45 minutes long, but he modernizes the language, cussing freely and doing away with confusing nicknames and patronymics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Chekhov's play, which premiered in 1901, focuses on the Prosorov sisters, who live off in the boonies of Russia and keep talking about how much they want to go back to Moscow while doing nothing about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The only real life in town is the garrison, whose troops have nothing better to do than to hang out at the sisters' house, drinking and philosophizing into the wee hours of the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Born to the idle class, the characters rhapsodize a lot about the importance of work only to become exhausted and miserable when they actually try it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mostly everyone sits around and watches their lives slip away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For all the refreshingly blunt dialogue in this translation, DMT artistic director Susan E. Evans' staging is slow moving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's not just because not much happens at any given time, but because it's played very low-key and slightly mechanically, at least at first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An awkward first act is redeemed somewhat by the second, in which people who hadn't shown much sign of life till then have a little more to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The titular sisters anchor the large cast nicely -- Daria Hepps as the fretful eldest, Olga; Kate Dunlop Tomatis as the bored and gloomy married sister, Masha; and especially Miriam Ani as the youngest, Irina, who still has some hope left to be crushed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Lindsey Marie Schmeltzer is pleasingly appalling as Natasha, the high-strung and controlling new wife of the sisters' listless brother, Andrey (a vague and distant Craig Dickerson).</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gene Mocsy is amusingly clueless as Fyodor, Masha's dull but doting teacher husband, who's seemingly oblivious to his wife's romance with Vershinin (a blandly pleasant Brian Levi), the new military commander who's always waxing philosophical about the future and whether or not happiness is possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Also among the ubiquitous soldiers are two unsuitable suitors for Irina, the nice but unstimulating Baron Tusenbach (a genial Paul Stout) and the obnoxious, mean-spirited Solyony (a sneering Tim Holt Jones).</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>John Baldwin slumps wearily as a nihilistic old army doctor who confesses to have forgotten even the basics of medicine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>John Hutchinson has some funny moments as an elderly and near-deaf messenger for the county council, and Marlene Walker is charmingly befuddled as the feeble old nanny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Nick Louie and Steve Allhoff are cheerful presences as two other soldiers who are always around but never become relevant, like guys you always see at parties but don't actually know their names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There are a few odd anachronisms in the design, such as Masha wearing what appears to be a black leather jacket with puffy 19th-century shoulder -- conspicuous among the other period costumes by Daisy Neske-Dickerson -- or three large fluorescent overhead lights being curiously prominent in Allen Willner's lighting design.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>One particularly clever touch is in Michael Locher's set of the elegant family manor; the tall green walls, smudged and streaked with age, close in tighter and tighter as the play goes on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It gives a strong sense of the sisters' world growing smaller, capturing that claustrophobic feeling of shrinking possibilities as effectively as anything actually happening between those walls.</td></tr>
