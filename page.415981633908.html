<h3>Kenya's president vows harsh action against Somali rebels</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Kenyan cities will run red with blood," said al-Shabab according to the SITE intelligence monitoring group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Islamic militants said the attack on Garissa college was in retaliation for killings carried out by Kenyan troops fighting the rebels in Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety, thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath," said al-Shabab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Following the extremists' threats, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to take harsh measures against the Islamic militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a nationally televised address, Kenyatta said his administration "shall respond in the severest ways possible" to the Garissa attack, which occurred Thursday when four gunmen entered a campus and slaughtered students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The military moved in hours later and the gunmen were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We will fight terrorism to the end," said Kenyatta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I want you to know that our security forces are pursuing the remaining accomplices. We will bring all of them to justice," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We are also in active pursuit of the mastermind (of the Garissa attack) and have placed a reward for his capture."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kenyatta declared 3 days of national mourning over the Garissa attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Five people have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the Garissa attack, a Kenyan official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Kenyan security agencies arrested three people trying to cross into Somalia, said Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka in a Twitter post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said the three are associates of Mohamed Mohamud, also known as Dulyadin Gamadhere, a former teacher at a Kenyan Madrassa Islamic school who authorities say coordinated the Garissa attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kenyan authorities have put a $220,000 bounty for information leading to Gamadhere's arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Two other suspects were arrested at Garissa college.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A survivor of the killings at Garissa University College was found on Saturday, two days after the attack by Islamic extremists killed 148 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, told The Associated Press from her hospital gurney that she hid in a wardrobe and covered herself with clothes, refusing to emerge even when some of her classmates came out of hiding at the demands of the gunmen from the al-Shabab group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She was rescued shortly before 10 a.m., according to Kenyan officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Cheroitich said she didn't believe that rescuers urging her to come out of her hiding place were there to help, suspecting at first that they were militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"How do I know that you are the Kenyan police?" she said she asked them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Only when Kenyan security forces had one of her teachers appeal to her did she come out, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I was just praying to my God," Cheroitich, a Christian, said of her ordeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Cheroitich appeared tired and thirsty, sipping on yoghurt and a soft drink, but otherwise seemed in good health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>She said she drank a body lotion because she was so thirsty and hungry while in hiding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Authorities displayed the bodies of the alleged attackers before about 2,000 people in a large open area in central Garissa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The bodies lay on the bed of a pickup truck that drove slowly past the crowd, which broke into a run in pursuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Soldiers monitored the crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>There was shouting and clouds of dust rose as the vehicle left the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Spectator Yusuf Mohamed applauded the display, saying authorities wanted to "win the hearts of the people" and clear any doubts that the attackers had been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Kenyan authorities initially said the attackers had been strapped with explosives that went off like bombs when they were shot, but investigators later said there were no suicide vests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The four bodies shown Saturday had wounds but were intact.</td></tr>
