<h3>Scientists emerge from isolated dome on Hawaii volcano slope</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>HONOLULU (AP) - Six scientists who were living under a dome on the slopes of a dormant Hawaii volcano for eight months to simulate life on Mars have emerged from isolation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The crew stepped outside the dome that's 8,000 feet up the slopes of Mauna Loa to feel fresh air on their skin Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was the first time they left without donning a space suit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The scientists are part of a human performance study funded by NASA that tracked how they worked together as a team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They have been monitored by surveillance cameras, body movement trackers and electronic surveys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Crew member Jocelyn Dunn said it was awesome to feel the sensation of wind on her skin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"When we first walked out the door, it was scary not to have a suit on," said Dunn, 27, a doctoral candidate at Purdue University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We've been pretending for so long."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The dome's volcanic location, silence and its simulated airlock seal provided an atmosphere similar to space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Looking out the dome's porthole windows, all the scientists could see were lava fields and mountains, said University of Hawaii professor Kim Binsted, principal investigator for the study, in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Spending eight months in a confined space with six people had its challenges, but crew members relieved stress doing team workouts and yoga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They were able to use a solar-powered treadmill and stationary bike, but only in the afternoons on sunny days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"When you're having a good day its fine, it's fun. You have friends around to share in the enjoyment of a good day," Dunn said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But if you have a bad day, it's really tough to be in a confined environment. You can't get out and go for a walk ... it's constantly witnessed by everyone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The hardest part was being far away from family and missing events like her sister's wedding, for which she delivered a toast via video, Dunn said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I'm glad I was able to be there in that way, but ... I just always dreamed of being there to help," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The first thing crew members did when they emerged from the dome was to chow down on foods they've been craving - juicy watermelon, deviled eggs, peaches and croissants, which was a step up from the freeze dried chili they'd been eating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Next on Dunn's list: going for a swim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Showers in the isolated environment were limited to six minutes per week, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"To be able to just submerge myself in water for as long as I want, to feel the sun, will be amazing," Dunn said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I feel like a ghost."</td></tr>
