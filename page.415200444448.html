<h3>The latest on the Boston Marathon bombing trial: Suspect used 'bomb favored by terrorists'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said Wednesday that Tsarnaev carried a bomb in a backpack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The prosecutor says: "It was the type of bomb favored by terrorists because it's designed to tear people apart and create a bloody spectacle."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tsarnaev had no reaction and continued to look straight ahead - not at the jury, not at the prosecutor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Weinreb continued: "The air was filled with the smell of burning sulfur and people's screams."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jurors deciding Tsarnaev's fate have been sworn in and are listening to preliminary instructions from the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Before the jury was brought in, Judge George O'Toole Jr. granted a prosecution motion to limit the amount of evidence the defense can present about the relationship between Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, during the guilt phase of the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tamerlan died during a gun battle with police days after the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>O'Toole says some evidence of the brothers' interactions will be "inevitable," but most should be reserved for the second phase of the trial, when jurors will decide whether Tsarnaev receives the death penalty or spends the rest of his life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tsarnaev is sitting alone at the defense table as his lawyers and prosecutors huddle at a sidebar with the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After a few moments, a member of his defense team goes to sit next to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tsarnaev's hair is still untamed and curly, and he has a scraggly goatee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He's wearing a gray suit jacket and slacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The judge has formally denied the fourth change-of-venue motion filed Monday by the defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers had acknowledged their three earlier requests were denied but said they wanted to complete the record of their opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They have argued their client couldn't get a fair trial in Massachusetts because of the publicity of the case and the proximity to the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Victims of the Boston Marathon bombing have arrived at court for opening statements in Tsarnaev's trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Two busloads of people hurt in the bombings arrived at the federal courthouse at 7:30 a.m. Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They entered through a side entrance, away from reporters and photographers gathered at the main entrance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Marc Fucarile (FYOO'-kuh-rihl) went in the front entrance but did not comment to reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He lost a leg in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Lawyers for Tsarnaev have made it clear they will try to show that he was influenced by his older brother, Tamerlan, who died following a shootout with police days after the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Prosecutors say Dzhokhar was an equal and willing participant in the plot that killed three and hurt more than 260.</td></tr>

<h3>Otto Porter, Professional NBA Player, Fell Asleep Or Something While Playing Defense</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Unfortunately for Washington Wizards forward Otto Porter, not everyone is in a profession in which their work is displayed on live TV for the entire world to see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>During a defensive possession against the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday, Porter temporarily fell asleep, or lost the use of his legs, or found himself wondering whether he left the oven on, or maybe was just like, "Fuck it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Whatever it was, it happened long enough that Porter looks like he legitimately forgot he was, you know, playing in an NBA basketball game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Love how Porter only realizes what has happened after someone yells "Otto!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>We feel you, Otto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>We've been there too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Wizards eventually lost by five, but that's not what's important here.</td></tr>
