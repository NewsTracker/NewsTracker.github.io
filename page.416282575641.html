<h3>Ukraine Journalist Killed By Masked Gunmen</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Ukrainian journalist known for his pro-Russian views has been shot dead by two masked men - in what is believed to be the ninth political killing in the country since January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Oles Buzina, who was a vocal supporter of Viktor Yanukovych, was assassinated outside his home in Kiev on Thursday afternoon, according to the interior ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 45-year-old's death comes after a former MP in Mr Yanukovych's regime, Oleg Kalashnikov, died in similar circumstances as he arrived home on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Officials close to President Petro Poroshenko have claimed both men were involved in last year's "Anti-Maidan" movement - which opposed the widespread pro-Western demonstrations which caused Mr Yanukovych to flee to Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At least seven other government officials from Mr Yanukovych's time in office have also died since the beginning of the year, with many cases treated as suicides by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In March, a prosecutor fell from the ninth-floor window of a block of flats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Meanwhile, in February, five former officials died in the space of four days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Two of the men were discovered with gunshot wounds, and their deaths were treated as suicides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The third was found hanged, and the fourth apparently jumped from the 17th floor of his apartment's building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The body of another man, who served as a deputy police chief in Melitopol, was found in a garage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The spate of mysterious deaths began at the end of January, when the former head of Kharkiv's regional government was found hanged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They come against the background of ongoing fighting between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatist fighters, in which more than 6,000 people are thought to have been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Russian president Vladimir Putin, who annexed Ukraine's Crimea region last year, has denied accusations that his troops are taking part in fighting in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>When asked about the latest assassinations during his annual phone-in on Thursday, Mr Putin said: "Ukraine is dealing with a whole string of such murders."</td></tr>
