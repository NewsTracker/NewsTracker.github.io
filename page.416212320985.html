<tr><td>3</td><td>But Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said this may not happen this time because of the supply issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Overall we view the trends over the weekend as an indication of solid demand paired with very limited supply, with supply being the most significant limiting factor," Munster said in a client note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Munster, who thinks Apple will sell 2.3 million watches in the April-June quarter, expects the company to ramp up production between mid-May and June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Estimates by shopping data firm Slice Intelligence and brokerage Cowen and Co pegged bookings on Friday, the first day of pre-orders, at about 1 million in the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For comparison, about 720,000 Android-powered smartwatches offered by companies including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and Sony Corp (6758.T) were shipped in all of 2014, according to market research firm Canalys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Analysts at brokerage Pacific Crest said their checks showed that Apple appeared to be ordering components for the watch that would allow it to make well over 20 million this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>UBS estimates that Apple will sell 16 million watches in fiscal 2015 ending September and 40 million in fiscal 2016.</td></tr>
