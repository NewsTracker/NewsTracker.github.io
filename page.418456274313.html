<h3>Hammon makes her summer league coaching debut for Spurs (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Every few minutes, Becky Hammon would check some notes and then stuff the list back into her hip pocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She huddled with her assistant coaches while scribbling up plays that she would show her team during timeouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She paced the sidelines at times, maybe burning off a bit of nervous energy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In other words, she coached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And while it might have seemed normal, it was different.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hammon made another piece of history Saturday, becoming the first woman to lead a team in an NBA summer league game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hammon and the San Antonio Spurs lost 78-73 to the New York Knicks in the Las Vegas league debut for both squads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''I'm learning all sorts of kinds of things, not just about Xs and Os but how to handle a team, how to speak to guys,'' Hammon said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Other women have coached in summer league - Basketball Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman was invited by Sacramento's George Karl to be on the Kings' staff this summer and Lindsey Harding, a former No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>1 overall pick in the WNBA draft, is a guest on Toronto's staff in Las Vegas - but no female had been actually in charge of a roster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''It shouldn't be a big deal because it's coaches coaching.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She's been given an opportunity to do what she's done her whole life,'' said Lieberman, who became the first woman to coach a men's pro team in the NBA Development League.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''The thing that catches everybody's eye is that we're women coaching men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Eventually, it'll be normal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But certainly, Becky has opened up a tremendous door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Things didn't always go as Hammon would have wanted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But she showed plenty of coaching savvy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She subbed out all five of her starters after 4 minutes, with the Spurs already down 13-2 - and she was fairly animated on the sideline while explaining how she wanted certain situations handled at that point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>San Antonio got up by nine in the fourth, but the Knicks answered with a 16-0 run capped by a wild jumper from rookie Kristaps Porzingis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Hammon wasn't fazed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She had two timeouts in the bank and used one with about 25 seconds left with her team down by three - then used the other with 16 seconds remaining when the first play she had drawn up for that situation fell apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Hammon briskly moved to half-court, got a ref's attention and called her final timeout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''I drew up a play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>I didn't draw it clear enough,'' Hammon said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''And I called a timeout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Let's get it right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>We got a good look ... so I'm learning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Do I want to absolutely go down to the wire every game?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Hammon is going into her second year as an assistant for the Spurs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The former WNBA star spent 16 seasons playing for New York and San Antonio, so it seemed fitting that her summer-coaching debut was against the Knicks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>She was clearly enjoying the moment pregame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Down on the far end from the Spurs bench, Lieberman blew her kisses and bowed, which earned her a smile and wave back from Hammon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>She waved at a couple other well-wishers as well, chatting with members of the Spurs staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Other than the black warmup pants (all the other Spurs coaches and staff were in in shorts), the hoop earrings and the ponytail, Hammon was just like everyone else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>And that's exactly the way she wanted it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>''To me, it's always about bigger picture,'' Hammon said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>''And we want to make sure that when your wife or your daughter goes for a job interview she gets the same opportunity that a guy gets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>That's the bigger picture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>That's the bigger goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Lieberman is close friends with Hammon, and they've talked plenty about being women who are making it in a world where men fill most of the coaching chairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>''We know we're women,'' Lieberman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>''We're just trying to do this thing and make it normal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>To all these other people, they haven't seen that before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>It's our job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>It's like President Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>He knew he was black before he got the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>It was his job to make it normal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>It got a little more normal on Saturday.</td></tr>
