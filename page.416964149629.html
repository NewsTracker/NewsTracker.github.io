<h3>Mexico Doing DNA Tests on Girl in Mistaken-Identity Case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A teenage girl at the center of an international custody case won't be sent to the United States until Mexican authorities confirm her identity through DNA testing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After Mexican authorities mistakenly seized another girl with a similar name and sent her across the border in April, Judge Cinthia Elodia Mercado said late Tuesday she would wait for the test results, which she expects Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mercado said relatives of 13-year-old Alondra Diaz Garcia agreed that Dorotea Garcia of Houston, Texas, is the girl's mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Alondra is believed to have been taken by her father to Mexico in 2007 without Garcia's consent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The girl will be staying with relatives and a child-protection official at a hotel in the city of Los Reyes, in the western state of Michoacan, until the tests results come back and the court hearings resume.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Garcia and the relatives agreed that no DNA test was needed, but apparently embarrassed by the first mistake, authorities want to be sure now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They (the relatives and the mother) did not want DNA testing carried out, but the prosecutor asked for it, to be certain," Mercado said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In April, Mexican officials seized a different girl, 14-year-old Alondra Luna, and Mercado ordered her into Garcia's custody despite protests by the teen's parents and without any DNA confirmation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The issue attracted international attention last month when a video was posted online showing Alondra Luna desperately resisting police after the court ruling, prompting protests for her return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A DNA test conducted in the United States revealed she wasn't Garcia's daughter and Luna was returned to her family in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mercado denied there was any contradiction in the way the two girls were handled, saying no one had asked for DNA testing on the first Alondra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The last time, it is important to point out that there was no request for DNA tests," said Mercado, apparently referring to requests from authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Alondra Luna's parents have said they begged Mercado not to take their daughter and demanded DNA testing, though it was unclear who would have paid for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"There has been no error made here," Mercado said of the first case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Garcia traveled to Mexico on Monday and has met with Alondra Diaz, according to the woman's lawyer, Pedro de la Rosa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He called the encounter a happy moment and said the girl was choosing to go with her mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Garcia would be willing to withdraw legal complaints against Alondra's father, Reynaldo Diaz, if she regains custody, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Alicia Diaz, the girl's aunt who accompanied her to the court, said her brother had decided to leave the girl with her grandmother to personally hand her over to Garcia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She said she was sure Alondra would be happy to be with Garcia, adding, "We will miss her."</td></tr>
