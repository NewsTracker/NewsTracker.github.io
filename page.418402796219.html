<h3>China fears propel Apple shares toward five-day losing streak</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Apple Watch is seen on display at the Apple retail store on 5th avenue in New York June 17, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) stock was heading toward its first five-session losing streak since January on Thursday as investors worried about the economic health of China, a key market for iPhones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple shares were down 2 percent at $120.15 in afternoon trade and have lost about 4 percent since July 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In the first three months of the year, for the first time, Apple sold more iPhones in China than in the United States, a trend expected to grow as Chinese consumers upgrade from less expensive handsets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But with around 30 percent knocked off the value of Chinese shares since mid June, some investors fear that the turmoil could hurt consumer demand and the Chinese economy as a whole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Individuals account for a major chunk of stock investing in China and the market selloff may curb their disposable incomes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"China is poised to be Apple's high-octane fuel for the next few years, especially for iPhones," said FBR analyst Daniel Ives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Given a lot of the dark clouds we are seeing in China, that has spooked investors."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Also rattling investors was a report this week by research firm Slice Intelligence that sales of the Apple Watch have dropped since its launch in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Apple has not disclosed sales of the devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Apple Watch is not seen as significant for profits in the short term but the wrist-worn gadget is Chief Executive Tim Cook's first major product and its failure would be poorly received by Wall Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple's stock was also within 1 percentage point of falling below its 200-day moving average, an indicator watched closely by traders, for the first time since April 2014.</td></tr>
