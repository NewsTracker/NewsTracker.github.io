    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The ruling Syriza party, elected in January on an anti-austerity platform, has been deeply split by the bailout deal that a reluctant Tsipras was forced to accept after gruelling negotiations in Brussels this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But around 30-40 Syriza lawmakers are likely either to abstain or vote against the government, raising a question mark over how long Tsipras can remain in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who was sacked by Tsipras last week, denounced the bailout as "a new Versailles Treaty" - the agreement that demanded unaffordable reparations from Germany after World War One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tsipras is expected to reshuffle his cabinet after the vote, replacing Lafazanis and Deputy Labour Minister Dimitris Stratoulis, another bailout opponent, and possibly making other changes as well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
