<h3>Phoenix Zoo discovers two-year-old Luka the bruin is a girl NOT a boy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Park officials were planning to transfer Luka to Nashville, Tennessee, when they discovered that the two-year-old Andean bear is a female, not a male as thought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>According to keepers, the species' genitalia are highly undeveloped before the age of two, making it very difficult to determine gender.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Many have been incorrectly sexed as cubs at other facilities in the past, the Phonenix Zoo notes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Luka was the first Andean cub successfully born and raised at the park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She was given her first medical exam at four months old when her gender was determined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It wasn't until last week, when Luka underwent a routine examination and health evaluation that it was found 'he' was actually a female bear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The zoo said Luka still might go to Nashville, but now that they know she's a 'she', it opens up other options for the bear's participation in a breeding program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Experts called the mistake 'great news for the management of this rare bear'.</td></tr>

<h3>Cyclone Nathan makes landfall in Australia, losses strength</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cyclone Nathan made landfall shortly before dawn as a category four system, the second highest intensity rating, and was expected to continue its westward movement inland while weakening, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The storm was downgraded by the bureau to a category three system at about 2200 GMT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At its peak, Nathan was packing sustained winds near the centre of 130 km (85 miles) per hour with wind gusts to 189 km per hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters there have been no reports of injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The cyclone is expected to lose much of its punch over land, but meteorologists warned it could reform again if it reaches the warm waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria, 250 km (155 miles) from the coast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The archipelago nation of Vanuatu was devastated last weekend by Cyclone Pam, one of the strongest storms ever to hit the South Pacific.</td></tr>
