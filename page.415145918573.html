<h3>How Lowestoft holds the key to winning the election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Or, rather, the phoney campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Maybe you're relishing every back-biting moment of it or maybe you're barely aware it's begun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Though we won't be marking our ballot papers until May 7, the parties have already been hammering away at each other for almost two months in the search for votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Unsurprising perhaps, given that the rise of Ukip in the South and the SNP in Scotland - as well as the Greens, who poll higher than the LibDems - makes this the most unpredictable General Election in modern history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The question is why these smaller parties are finding so much traction among the populace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It's clear that voters hate the childish point-scoring that politicians so love.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There is also a strong sense they are often patronised rather than treated as serious people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Some would argue it's the appeal of the new parties' leaders, or their policies, which are boosting them, but there is another way of explaining it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Political movements do not create changes in society: they respond to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And something has changed in Britain - more voters than ever are ill at ease, or downright disillusioned, with the established parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Forty years ago, Norman Kirk, who was then the Prime Minister of New Zealand, tried to define what people want from life and, by extension, what they seek in a political leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>We don't want much, he said, just 'someone to love, somewhere to live, somewhere to work and something to hope for'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He was talking not so much about politics as about fundamental human needs, but he intended it to carry political meaning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Politically fascinating: For 30 years, the party that has won Lowestoft has won Westminster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Those four requirements have helped to define the good life in Britain for generations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>My parents talked about the 'man from the welfare' who demanded to know from a widowed neighbour why she was claiming assistance, because when he inspected her house he found she had four chairs at the kitchen table, but only one child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Couldn't she have sold the other two?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And yet that reasonable expectation described by Norman Kirk was still strong then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>I never doubted for a moment that I'd get a job when I left school or that one day I would be able to buy a house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And my parents never doubted that I and my siblings would be better off than them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ten years ago, nearly two-thirds of 25 to 34-year-olds owned their own home - now it's just over a third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>For ten years up to 2006, we could rely on our wages making us 2 per cent better off every year after inflation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Then wages stalled and prices rose: for the longest period ever recorded, we got about 2 per cent worse off year on year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Recently, things have started to pick up - wages have overtaken inflation again - but it is a brave economist who would forecast with confidence that the old order has been restored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In recent months, the economic news has been looking up, but can we ever expect to enjoy those old certainties about life again?</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Some MPs believe this deep sense of insecurity has put a powerful emotional charge in the political air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>So, which party will most successfully harness or exploit this febrile atmosphere on May 7?</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Where will a voter guided by emotion (as opposed to one who makes hard-headed decisions about the governance of Britain) put their cross on the ballot paper?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Across Europe, in Spain and Italy, for example, minority parties are making great gains by appealing to disillusioned voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In Greece, as we have just seen, the threat of such an upstart party seizing control has become reality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>When the leader of Syriza, the charismatic young Alexis Tsipras, made his acceptance speech, he chose one word to explain why the people of Greece had turned away from the old to risk the new.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It was 'elpida', meaning 'hope'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In Britain, too, people desperately want to vote for someone who will give them hope - that their voice will be listened to at last.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The new challenge for the old establishment is to find an emotional tone of voice to appeal to those people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>For in the real world away from Westminster, countless thousands of votes will be cast that are motivated not by the small print of party manifestos, but by something deeper and perhaps less well understood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Which takes us back to the former PM of New Zealand Norman Kirk, and the reason why I have been spending so much time recently in Lowestoft filming for the BBC1 Panorama programme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>In the final month before the start of the campaign proper, Panorama is putting aside its usual diet of hard-edged investigation and, using Kirk's four themes, is trying to paint a picture of Britain that is as much emotional as factual.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Lowestoft may not be the first town you'd choose to look for hope.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Politically it's fascinating, because it's one of those bellwether constituencies much loved by political nerds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>For 30 years, the party that has won Lowestoft has won Westminster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>But, if the polls are to be believed, this election might be the one that breaks the mould.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>From Clapton to Cleethorpes, the seaside towns of the East Coast appear to be looking for a new saviour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>And that saviour may well be clad in Ukip colours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Such is the disillusion at the three traditional parties that in the Lowestoft district in last May's European elections, Ukip polled nearly 50 per cent more votes than the Tories, with Labour and others even further behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Why?</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Fishing - the industry that sustained the town over the generations - is dying, if not dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>One of the most haunting sights on the outskirts of the Suffolk town is what locals call The Nets: an acre of land on the seashore covered with frames built from sturdy timbers where the huge drift nets were hung to dry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>No nets hang there today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>A century ago, there were more than 500 trawlers and drift netters registered to operate out of here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Now, just ten boats remain: small inshore vessels no more than ten metres long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Their skippers fish the way men have fished for millennia: lines slung over the sides of the boat with baited hooks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>This is a hard way to earn a living.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>I went out with Steve Wightman, whose family have been working these waters for at least 200 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>A vicious north-east wind made the sea too rough to catch anything, and I was mightily relieved when it was decided to return to port, but Steve wasn't complaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>As he said, real fishermen don't complain about the weather; they live with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>But I heard many complaints at the weekly fish auction on the quayside - all summed up in a few words: Europe's fishing regulations, and the limited quotas they impose on each fisherman in terms of what species they can catch and how much of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Steve's wife, Emma, told me: 'You can cope with the weather and you can cope with the tides and getting up at two in the morning in the freezing cold, but you can't cope with throwing half your day's catch back into the sea when you've got bills to pay and children to feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Do they believe the Coalition is fighting tooth and nail on their behalf against Brussels?</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>The dramatic show of support here for Ukip's anti-EU message is the clearest possible answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Cleethorpes: The seaside towns of the East Coast appear to be looking for a new saviour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Lowestoft has another reason for its anger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>A bridge is the perfect metaphor for hope: it overcomes obstacles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>But several times a day, the town grinds to a halt because the only bridge across the harbour that joins the two halves of the town has to be raised to allow ships through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Everyone agrees there is a desperate need for a new one, but politicians from across the spectrum and all the way to Westminster have been arguing about it for 40 years, and still nothing happens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>The disenchantment such issues provokes is what should worry members of the old political establishment, if they ever manage to spend longer than ten minutes on flying visits to towns such as Lowestoft - towns that are geographically isolated and struggling to rebuild their futures on the ruins of dying industries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Not one of the people I spoke to in Lowestoft had anything but disdain for the traditional parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>Maybe the people here will get new jobs one day, but there is a powerful sense that their problems will be solved in spite of politicians rather than because of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>There is also suspicion that too many politicians subscribe to what has become a fashionable view in some metropolitan circles: that towns like theirs represent a Britain that's going nowhere and thus should be ignored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Add to that the belief in many corners of the country that the political establishment is happier scoring points in the House of Commons and patronising the electorate with meaningless slogans - such as calling them 'everyday' folk - and you end up with a pretty toxic brew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>For our ruling classes to remind themselves how much hope matters might prove a useful antidote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>They could, at least, start by digging out Norman Kirk's old speech.</td></tr>

<h3>Ferguson police levied excessive traffic fines on blacks ? DOJ leak</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A US Department of Justice report, to be released this week, alleges that Ferguson police are guilty of disproportional fining and arresting African-American residents to balance the town's budget, making the lives of those unable to pay a nightmare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Officials familiar with the report told The New York Times that it will be "highly critical" of police practices in the town, where the majority of the population is black but the police department and local government are mostly white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Traffic fines are the town's second largest source of income, after sales tax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The DoJ report says that financial incentives are driving law enforcement to continue unfair policies, predominantly targeting African-Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In 2013, African-Americans accounted for 86 percent of traffic stops, while making up 63 percent of Ferguson's population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>For those too poor to pay their tickets, routine traffic stops in Ferguson could end up in repeated imprisonment due to mounting fines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Because such systems do not account for individual circumstances of the accused, they essentially mandate pretrial detention for anyone who is too poor to pay the predetermined fee," the NYT cited the top civil rights prosecutor supervising the Ferguson inquiry at the Justice Department, Vanita Gupta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Grievances against the city administration has been accumulating for years before finally erupting in the form of violent protests in August 2014, sparked by a killing of an unarmed African-American young man Michael Brown by white police officer Darren Wilson on August 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The DoJ report will likely result in significant changes inside the Ferguson Police Department, because local officials will have to either negotiate a settlement with the DoJ or be sued by the department on civil rights charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Justice Department recently filed a similar lawsuit against the city of Clanton, Alabama, which imprisoned poor debtors unable to pay fines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The report is not expected to dig specifically into racial motivations behind Ferguson police concentrating their activities on African-Americans, but it will criticize police tactics as having a "disparate impact" on the African-American majority, which could be avoided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Last summer, when the DoJ prepared a report into similar activities by the police department in Newark, it acknowledged that local law enforcement stopped African-Americans significantly more often than whites, making that African-Americans "bore the brunt" of the unconstitutional police practices taking root in the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This disparity is stark and unremitting," the Justice Department wrote in that report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Attorney General Eric Holder, the first African-American to hold that office, said last summer after returning from the epicenter of unrest in Missouri: "I wanted the people of Ferguson to know that I personally understood that mistrust. I wanted them to know that while so much else may be uncertain, this attorney general and this Department of Justice stands with the people of Ferguson."</td></tr>
