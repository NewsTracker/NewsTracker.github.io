<tr><td>5</td><td>The hiring was delayed briefly after the Sabres were required under NHL rules to compensate the Penguins for hiring Bylsma because he was still under contract with Pittsburgh after being relieved of his duties a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Sabres were expected to send the Penguins a future draft pick in exchange for Bylsma, whose contract with the Penguins ran through June 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Bylsma, who coached the Sidney Crosby-led Penguins to win the 2009 Cup championship, takes over a franchise coming off consecutive last-place finishes and attempting to rebuild through youth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He replaces Ted Nolan, who was fired a day after the season ended, and becomes Buffalo's third coach since Lindy Ruff was fired in February 2013.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>Buffalo was forced to restart its search last week after losing out on Babcock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The former Red Wings coach turned down the Sabres' offer to instead sign with Toronto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The hiring leaves the New Jersey Devils as the NHL's only other team with a coaching vacancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Bylsma and the Sabres have several connections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Pegulas were previously based in Pittsburgh before purchasing the Sabres in February 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Terry Pegula was such a Penguins fan that he named his beloved dog Sidney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Though the Penguins enjoyed plenty of regular-season success under Bylsma, they faltered in the playoffs after winning the Cup in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They were twice knocked out in the first round and reached the Eastern Conference final just once more, in 2013, when they were swept by Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Sabres have missed the playoffs in each of the past four seasons and haven't won a playoff series since 2007, when Buffalo reached the Eastern Conference final.</td></tr>
