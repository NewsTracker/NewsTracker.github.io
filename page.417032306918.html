<h3>Egyptian court sentences former President Mohammed Morsi to death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO - An Egyptian court has sentenced ousted President Mohammed Morsi to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The verdict was announced Saturday in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>As is customary in passing capital punishment, Judge Shaaban el-Shami referred his death sentence on Morsi and more than 20 others to the nation's top Muslim theologian, or mufti, for his non-binding opinion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president, was ousted by the military in July 2013 following days of mass street protests by Egyptians demanding that he be removed because of his divisive policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The ousted leader already is serving a 20-year sentence following his conviction on April 21 on charges linked to the killing of protesters outside a Cairo presidential palace in December 2012.</td></tr>
