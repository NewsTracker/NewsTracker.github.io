<h3>FIFA presidential election to be held on Feb 26</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA president Sepp Blatter is photographed while banknotes thrown by British comedian Simon Brodkin hurtle through the air during a press conference following the extraordinary FIFA Executive Committee at the headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, Monday, July 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>During the extraordinary FIFA Executive Committee meeting the agenda for the elective Congress for the FIFA presidency was finalized and approved: The congress will take place on Feb. 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>ZURICH (AP) - Sepp Blatter will stay in control of world soccer for seven more months after resisting calls to step down immediately ahead of a presidential election, which FIFA decided Monday will be on Feb. 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A defiant first public appearance by Blatter since his resignation statement last month began in pandemonium as he was showered in fake money by a comedian who gatecrashed the media conference at FIFA's headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Where is my security?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Blatter shouted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The interruption provided an awkward reminder of a far more serious incident for FIFA in May, when the arrest of soccer and sports marketing officials plunged the game's ruling body into its deepest crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jolted by dual American and Swiss criminal investigations into soccer corruption, Blatter suddenly announced four days after being elected for a fifth term that he would leave FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It was not only the pressure of any authorities ... it was also the pressure of political interference and also the pressure of you, media," said Blatter, who is a target of the U.S. investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I had to do something very special and I did it. In footballing terms, I kicked the ball out of the field to stop something."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>FIFA's executive committee decided at a meeting Monday on the February election date and Blatter ended weeks of uncertainty by insisting he would not perform one of his renowned about-turns by in fact being a candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"On the 26th of February FIFA will have a new president," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I cannot be the new president because I am the old president."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The 79-year-old Blatter, who first joined FIFA 40 years ago, has held onto the most powerful job in world soccer since 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, who lost to Blatter in May, had told The Associated Press earlier Monday: "President Blatter's resignation cannot be dragged out any longer. He must leave now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But while Blatter said he felt "regret" about the crises, he insisted he would not be "abandoning" the presidency until a successor is elected by the 209 members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I am still the elected president by 133 national associations and I will use my mandate as president ... to make sure that when at the end of February I come at the end of my career I can say the FIFA we have started again - with the reforms," Blatter said, highlighting the need to "rebuild the reputation of FIFA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Feb. 26 date was seen as a political victory for Blatter over UEFA and other confederations, who thought they had agreement on Sunday for Jan. 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Instead, Blatter and senior vice president Issa Hayatou cited the importance of the second-tier African Nations Championship - a tournament for little-known home-based players - hosted in Rwanda from Jan. 16-Feb. 7.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Presidential candidates must gain five nominations from FIFA's 209 member associations by an Oct. 26 deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Only former Brazil great Zico and Liberia football federation president Musa Bility have so far expressed their intention to stand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Other potential candidates are Prince Ali and UEFA President Michel Platini, who is still mulling over his decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"He loves the fact that UEFA is associated with football on a daily basis and the thousands of matches we organize," Platini's spokesman, Pedro Pinto, said outside FIFA headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"FIFA is a more political organization and he is a man of football. He's not a man of politics."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In a statement Platini limited himself to saying: "Now we have a concrete date, which means we can look forward to new leadership which will surely bring with it new ideas and new solutions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Platini welcomed the creation of a reforms task force, which will consider introducing term limits, integrity checks for executive committee members and pay details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Blatter declined repeatedly on Monday to reveal his salary.</td></tr>
