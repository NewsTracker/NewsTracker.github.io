<h3>Ukraine president signs law allowing suspension of debt repayments: press service</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Thursday signed a law that gives the government the right to halt scheduled repayments on foreign debts if necessary, his press service said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Parliament passed the draft law on May 19 as a wrangle intensified between the near-bankrupt former Soviet republic and its creditors over restructuring $23 billion of foreign debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The restructuring is needed to save $15.3 billion between 2015 and 2018, as required by the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The law would come into effect once it was published and remain in force until July 1 next year, the presidential press service said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A creditors' committee representing about $9 billion of Ukraine's external debt has objected to Kiev's call for a writedown on principal owed, although it says it wants a restructuring settlement that will lead to economic recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ukraine's finance ministry expressed confidence this week that it would complete the restructuring with its creditors, clearing the way for fresh IMF aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But it indicated it would continue to insist on a writedown of the principal owed.</td></tr>
