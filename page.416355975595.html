<h3>IS releases video purportedly showing execution of 30 Ethiopian Christians</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Islamic State jihadist group has released a video purportedly showing the executions of some 30 Ethiopian Christians captured in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 29-minute video purports to show militants holding two groups of captives, described in text on the screen as "followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A masked fighter brandishing a pistol makes a statement threatening Christians if they do not convert to Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The video then switches between footage of one group of about 12 men being beheaded by masked militants on a beach and another group of at least 16 being shot in the head in a desert area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was not immediately clear who the captives were or exactly how many were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Before the killings, the video shows purported footage of Christians in Syria explaining how they had been given the choice of either converting to Islam or paying a special tax, and had decided to pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The video bore the logo of Islamic State's (IS) media arm and was similar to footage released in the past, including of a group of 21 Coptic Christians, mainly Egyptians, beheaded on a Libyan beach in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Several Libyan jihadist groups have pledged allegiance to IS, the extremist organisation that seized control of large parts of Syria and Iraq last year and declared an Islamic "caliphate".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>IS has carried out widespread violent atrocities and won the support of jihadist groups across the region, including in chaos-hit Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It has persecuted minorities including Christians and its executions of the Egyptian Copts prompted retaliatory air strikes from Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Egypt called for an international intervention against the jihadists in Libya but Western diplomats expressed reservations, saying a political deal must be the priority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A US-led coalition of Western and Arab nations is carrying out an air war against IS in Syria and in Iraq, where pro-government forces have managed in recent months to retake some territory seized by the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The group's attacks have raised fears for Christians across the Middle East and been condemned by religious leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Why are young Australians being drawn to Islamic State?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Where do foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria come from?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>How does the Arab world view Islamic State?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Where does IS get its money?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Explained: What's going on in Iraq and Syria?</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Islamic State: What's behind the group's many monikers?</td></tr>
