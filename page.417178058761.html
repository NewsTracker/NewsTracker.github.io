<h3>Warriors hold off Harden, Rockets 99-98 to take 2-0 lead (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OAKLAND, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- James Harden had Game 2 on his fingertips - and then he didn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Now the Golden State Warriors have the Western Conference finals in their grasp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Stephen Curry scored 33 points before Harden lost the ball in the closing seconds to end a spectacular duel between the NBA MVP and runner-up, and the Warriors held off the Houston Rockets 99-98 on Thursday night to take a 2-0 lead in the series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''Sometimes I want to crack open a beer and get a courtside seat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>These two guys are the two best basketball players in the world,'' Warriors center Andrew Bogut said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Harden rallied the Rockets from 17 points down in the second quarter and had a chance to finish off the comeback in the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Instead, Klay Thompson and Curry trapped Harden, who lost the ball as time expired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Harden fell to the floor and put his hands over his head as the Warriors celebrated on the court, the sellout crowd of 19,596 roared, and golden-yellow confetti fell from the rafters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''Kicking chairs,'' Harden said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''It's frustrating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Harden had 38 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, and Dwight Howard overcame a sprained left knee that slowed him down to finish with 19 points and 17 rebounds for a Rockets team headed home in a major hole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Game 3 is Saturday in Houston, which is facing a two-game deficit again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Rockets overcame a 3-1 hole in the second round against the Los Angeles Clippers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''We're not going to go anywhere,'' Rockets coach Kevin McHale said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Curry made five 3-pointers to go with six assists and three rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He got a big boost from his teammates - notably Bogut, Draymond Green and Thompson - to regroup after the Warriors lost the big lead in the first half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But the Warriors pulled ahead late in the fourth quarter because of Curry - with his shot and his passes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Curry connected on a 3-pointer, then found Bogut under the rim for a layup that sent the 7-footer flexing his muscles and shouting to the roaring, yellow-shirt wearing crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Bogut missed the ensuing free throw, but the Warriors led 96-89 with 2:25 left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Harden brought Houston back and the Rockets also forced the Warriors into an 8-second, backcourt violation before Harden found Howard for an alley-oop that sliced Golden State's lead to 99-98 with 33 seconds remaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>After a timeout, Harrison Barnes missed a difficult reverse layup contested by Howard as the shot clock nearly expired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Harden got the ball down the court, and McHale elected not to call timeout because his team had the Warriors scrambling and outmanned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''I will take our best player heading downhill on a broken court any day of the week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>That's where he feasts,'' McHale said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Harden was defended by Thompson and Curry came over near the 3-point line, where Harden lost the ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Time expired amid the scramble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''You knew he probably wasn't going to pass,'' Curry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Warriors bench ran onto the court in celebration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Harden lay on the floor until teammates helped him up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''I just wanted to stay big and force a contested shot,'' Thompson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The play ended a fast-paced, back-and-forth contest - one that saw the Rockets rally the same way the Warriors did in Game 1, when they came back from a 16-point deficit in the second quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''A little too drama-filled for us,'' Curry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Howard wore a black brace over his sprained left knee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>He lacked the usual lift in his legs - unable to contest many of those rim-rattling dunks - but still produced on both ends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Even still, the Rockets turned to Harden when they needed a charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He helped Houston regroup with a 23-6 run in the second quarter as they took advantage of Golden State's sloppy turnovers (17 in all), tying the score at 55-all at the half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Thompson, Barnes and Leandro Barbosa took turns guarding Harden in the second half, when both teams struggled to contain the other's leading man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''It's great competition,'' Warriors coach Steve Kerr said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Rockets: Houston is 0-6 against the Warriors this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>... The Rockets haven't won at Golden State since Dec. 13, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Warriors: Golden State is 45-3 at home this season, including 6-1 in the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>... The Warriors are 54-0 when leading by at least 15 points at any point in a game this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Former San Francisco Giants slugger and home run king Barry Bonds shook hands with several Warriors players before the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>... Montell Jordan sang a stirring rendition of the national anthem and performed his 1995 hit song ''This Is How We Do It'' at halftime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>... Oakland native and rapper MC Hammer and actor Blake Anderson, the star of the TV series ''Workaholics,'' also were among the crowd.</td></tr>
