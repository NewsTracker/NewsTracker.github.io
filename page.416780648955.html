<h3>Germanwings plane disaster: co-pilot may have practised descent</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Germanwings pilot Andreas Lubitz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The co-pilot who crashed his Germanwings plane into the Alps on March 24, killing all 150 on board, may have 'practised' his descent hours earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>According to German newspaper Bild, the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz rehearsed the descent on a flight from Dusseldorf to Barcelona earlier the same day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>French emergency rescue services work at the site of the crash in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The paper cites information from the French aviation safety authority BEA, recovered from the plane's data recorder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In an interim report to be published on Wednesday, the authority found there was "several minutes of controlled flight in a technically unjustified descent" during the A320's flight previous to the one from Barcelona that he crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The paper said the co-pilot may even have been trying to crash the plane on that previous flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prosecutors believe 27 year-old Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit and steered the plane into a mountain on the second flight back from Barcelona to Dusseldorf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>German investigators found evidence the co-pilot had suffered depression and had researched suicide plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The BEA report is due to be published in at midday, French time.</td></tr>
