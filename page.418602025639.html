<h3>Greek PM Tsipras replaces rebels in reshuffle</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (R) sits next to Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos during a parliamentary session in Athens, July 16, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Friday kicked out of his government rebel ministers who voted against reforms demanded by international creditors in return for a rescue deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tsipras was weakened by a revolt in his left-wing Syriza party, who voted against the measures on Thursday, forcing him to rely on opposition votes to pass the package Greece needs to stay afloat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Labour Minister Panos Skourletis will become energy minister to replace Panagiotis Lafazanis, one of the hardline rebels in the Syriza party.</td></tr>
