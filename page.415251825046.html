<h3>Motherlode Blog: Introducing Motherlode?s New Artist-In-Residence: Abigail Gray Swartz</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>She'll be accompanying essays and posts here with art that's like an essay in a different format.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The longer I look at her work, the more it says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She first appeared in this space illustrating Margaret Gilmour's essay, "My Friend Has a Son Who Is Autistic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If you read a little further, you'll get a sense of how that came about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>I am really excited to be the Artist-in-Residence for the next three months; what a great blog and forum for sharing thoughts and ideas on being a parent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A little bit about me: I grew up on a horse farm surrounded by woods and fields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In this natural setting, I played with my three siblings, burying rodent skulls and handcrafted treasure maps, building miniature creek dams and snow forts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The slower pace of childhood and time spent in nature are often themes in my work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Now, as a mother of two, I encourage my children to explore the outdoors and use their imaginations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Since becoming a mother, my art has switched focus from large installation and abstract work to portraits and painting the little fleeting moments of childhood and these early years of motherhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>My goal this year is to finish and publish my own children's books as well as illustrating books for others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I recently finished illustrating "None for Me Thanks" with my friend and neighbor, Margaret Gilmour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It's our first book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>We're creating a series, about two young neighbors, Otto and Iris, who form an unlikely bond through their imaginative play in nature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>For now, I'm enjoying this work, commission projects like portraits and landscapes, and art I create and sell through my shop on Etsy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>My big, long term dream is to curate a children's museum composed of artist installations: a place of magic, and of wonder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Motherlode blog welcomes our new artist-in-residence, illustrator Abigail Gray Swartz.</td></tr>
