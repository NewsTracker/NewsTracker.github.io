<h3>White House: No sign of Islamic State link to Yemen attacks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the U.S. is still investigating the claim of responsibility by the Yemeni branch of Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said the U.S. is looking to see whether IS has a command-and-control structure that would enable it to coordinate the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Earnest also said IS often claims responsibility for attacks purely for propaganda value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Still, he said the attack shows that everyone in the region - including Muslims - is in danger from IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Earnest said there's also no clear evidence backing up the IS claim of responsibility for another deadly attack in Tunisia this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the White House's National Security Council, said the U.S condemns the attacks and also condemns airstrikes Thursday that targeted Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The airstrikes by forces loyal to Yemen's former president missed his palace and Hadi was unharmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Meehan said the U.S. is calling on all sides in Yemen to return to political talks to resolve differences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She said all of Yemen's diverse communities must take part in a peaceful democratic process.</td></tr>
