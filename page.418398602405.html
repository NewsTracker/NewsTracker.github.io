<h3>Yahoo hopes to cash in on daily fantasy sports contests</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Exterior view of Yahoo headquarters on Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2014, in Sunnyvale, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yahoo on Wednesday launched daily fantasy sports games, allowing its tens of millions of fantasy sports fans the chance to win cash in daily contests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Unlike season-long fantasy leagues, users participate in the daily contests by paying an entry fee (up to $500) and choosing a team from a list of players competing in that day's games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Users can also create their own contests and invite friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Yahoo generally takes a 10 percent cut from each entry fee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>ESPN and Yahoo have long competed for fans playing season-long leagues, where friends pick favorite players and compete against each other for months during baseball or football season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the daily game space, Yahoo will now square off against companies like FanDuel and DraftKings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kenneth Fuchs, a Yahoo vice president, said the opportunity is huge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He pointed to research that showed the market for contest entry fees in daily fantasy sports games are expected to reach $18 billion by 2020.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The rise of daily is early, but real," Fuchs said at a San Francisco press conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Fuchs says what sets Yahoo's games apart from competitors is the site's in-depth content, including stories and stats on players for a fantasy team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Yahoo has a loyal following among fantasy sports players; currently its users spend a whopping 500 million hours a year playing fantasy sports on its site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Fuchs declined to say whether the daily fantasy sports games would have a meaningful impact on revenue, stating that Yahoo does not break out those figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But analysts say they believe the games could boost the Sunnyvale company's coffers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's just a question of how much of that money they are going to be able to capture," said Rob Enderle, with advisory services firm Enderle Group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Yahoo has been under a lot of pressure from investors to increase its revenue and profit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The company, once a leader in desktop search ads, has struggled in its transition into the mobile space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>CEO Marissa Mayer has heavily invested in making the company mobile first, by increasing staffing in that area and acquiring startups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>One of those was Bignoggins Productions, a fantasy sports company that had only one employee but specialized in creating a range of mobile apps for fantasy sports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"They really can't afford any failures now," Enderle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"They need to build success on success. They have this to showcase progress."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Yahoo's daily fantasy sports games are available in 45 states and available on iOS, desktop and mobile Web.</td></tr>
