<h3>John Boehner to launch new investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner is expected to announce a new investigation this week into the emails Hillary Clinton sent while she was Secretary of State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Clinton has been under fire after it was revealed she used a personal email account - hrd22@clintonemail.com - instead of a government one while leading the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At a press conference last week, Clinton said all of her 'work-related' emails from the personal account were delivered to the State Department after a 'thorough' review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But top House Republicans told ABC News that Boehner plans to further investigate after Clinton admitted to destroying more than 31,000 emails that were deemed personal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A question-and-answer document distributed by Clinton states that 30,490 emails were designated as 'work-related', while 31,380 were determined to be 'private and personal'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton said that subjects of the personal emails varied from planning her daughter Chelsea's wedding to her mother's funeral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She added that she had deleted the personal emails because she did not feel there was any reason to save them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Clinton acknowledged that it 'would've been better' if she had used a second email account and carried a second phone but at the time had opted for the 'convenience' of only having to carry one device for all her emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She also noted that the 'vast majority' of her work emails were sent to government email addresses and were thus 'captured and preserved immediately' on the State Department's system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Clinton has asked the State Department to make her work-related emails public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The personal email address surfaced as multiple congressional panels investigated the 2012 attack on a US diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, during Clinton's State Department tenure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A special House Committee exclusively focused on auditing the executive branch's response to the 2012 Benghazi terror attack is subpoenaing emails from Clinton's personal account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, the head of the committee, said he wants Clinton to testify about her email practices before Congress by April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'Who gets to decide what's personal and what's public?' he said on Fox News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>As for Clinton, she said believes most people will understand that 'no one' wants their personal emails made public and will 'respect that privacy'.</td></tr>
