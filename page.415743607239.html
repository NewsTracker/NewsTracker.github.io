<h3>Germanwings plane crash: A320 pilot says co-pilot can be locked out of cockpit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It is possible for one pilot of an Airbus A320 to lock the other pilot out of the cockpit to the extent that he cannot regain entry, even if the aircraft is in a fatal dive, says an Australian pilot of an A320.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The New York Times has reported, citing an official involved in the Germanwings crash investigation, that the cockpit voice recorder shows one of the pilots had left the flight deck and could not regain entry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"You can hear he is trying to smash the [cockpit] door down," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A view of the cockpit of Airbus' A320 type aircraft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An Australian A320 pilot, who declined to be named, said the locked flight deck of the aircraft could be entered using an emergency code on a keypad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the case of the pilot flying the aircraft being incapacitated, the door will automatically open after a set period of time if the correct code is entered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However, in the event a pilot flying the aircraft does not want the other pilot to enter the flight deck, the one in the cockpit has the ability to block entry if he reacts before the door would be opened automatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"If the person on the other side of the door says 'no', you can't get in," the Australian pilot said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Germanwings A320 crashed in a remote section of the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He added that the doors are bolted and heavily protected and it would likely be impossible to break it down within minutes, even if passengers or flight attendants assisted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"If a crew member locks down the flight deck with the manual doors, nothing will open it," a second Australian pilot said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The US Federal Aviation Authority established new standards for cockpit doors months after the deadly September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that required the flight deck to be tough enough to withstand small-arms fire or even a grenade without opening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>International operators also adopted the doors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A 2002 Airbus promotional video showed the reinforced flight deck could be entered after 30 seconds provided the right code was provided in the event of no response from pilots, but there is a manual override on the feature during that period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In the US, many airlines have a "two in the cockpit" policy which means if one pilot exits to use the toilet or for any other reason, a flight attendant must then enter the flight deck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It is understood the Civil Aviation Safety Authority does not require a second person in the cockpit at all times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A Virgin spokeswoman said the airline would not comment on its safety and security policies other than saying robust procedures were in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Aviation sources said Qantas does not require a second person in the flight deck at all times, but an official response was being sought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ron Bartsch, the chairman of AvLaw International and a former head of safety at Qantas, said flight decks had been made especially secure to prevent terrorists from gaining access, but it had a dual effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"They make the cockpit so it is inaccessible, and it is inaccessible to another pilot as well," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"You can't have a situation that fixes everything or is fail safe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Germanwings aircraft descended from its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet before hitting a mountain in the French alps eight minutes later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Australian pilot said in the event the pilot flying the aircraft had been incapacitated, the plane would have continued at cruising altitude using its autopilot function.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The pilot said the A320 is also equipped with an "expedite" function that allows the pilot to manually descend to a set level on its flight path.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The function is sometimes used in normal situations but also in the event of decompression, and the descent speed of the Germanwings flight could be consistent with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>However, the expedite function requires the pilot to set a specific altitude to which the aircraft will descend before levelling off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In the case of decompression, the standard setting is 10,000 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Germanwings A320 crashed at an altitude of around 6000 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The investigation into the crash remains ongoing and it is still unclear whether one of the pilots downed the plane in a deliberate act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Mr Bartsch said he would not want to pre-judge the outcome of the investigation but the pilot suicide theory was "not inconsistent with information we have had confirmed already", such as the flight path and the lack of responses to calls from air traffic control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"If the person is suicidal and did that they are probably not going to respond," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The second Australian pilot said a flight attendant present in the cockpit while one pilot was away might be able to at least open the door or use the radio if trained properly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He added mental health checks were probably the best means of preventing pilot suicide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Australian pilots receive a mental health check at every medical exam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The medical exams take place at least annually and more often for older aircrew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>However, failing a check would ground a pilot and lead to them losing their job, so under the current system there are also incentives for pilots to say they are in a fit state even if they are not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>There are other cases of pilot suicide resulting in aircraft crashes, including the loss of Mozambique airline LAM's Flight 470 in 2013 in Namibia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>In that case, the captain made inputs that directed the plane to the ground shortly after the first officer left the flight deck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>All 33 people on board were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>In 1997, Silkair Flight 185, a Boeing 737 en route from Jakarta to Singapore crashed in Indonesia following a rapid descent from cruising altitude.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>In that case, there was also speculation that the first officer had left the flight deck when the crash occurred.</td></tr>
