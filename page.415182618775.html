<h3>Community debuts new trailer for Yahoo that spoofs Avengers: Age of Ultron after being canceled by NBC</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Playing on the popularity of another hotly anticipated premiere - Avengers: Age of Ultron - the trailer dubbed the show 'Community: Age of Yahoo,' and announced its return, March 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After Jeff (Joel McHale) assures everyone there is 'no cause for alarm,' Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) steps in to introduce 'New Shirley,' aka Paget Brewster.</td></tr>

<h3>Southampton 1-0 Crystal Palace</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Senegalese chipped over Julian Speroni after the Palace keeper could not hold James Ward-Prowse's shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The visitors had looked most likely to score with Wilfried Zaha striking a post in the second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But a first home goal in four games handed Alan Pardew a first away defeat since becoming Palace boss in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>For long periods in the game it looked like Southampton's woes in front of goal would continue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mane was guilty of several glaring misses in the first half, but the introduction of substitute Ward-Prowse made a difference as his surging run led to a first Saints goal in six hours and 27 minutes at St Mary's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The result was also a first victory in four league games for Ronald Koeman's side, who remain in contention for a Champions League place despite their recent poor form.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They are now a point behind fourth-placed Manchester United, having played a game more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>For much of the first half the hosts clearly lacked confidence in the final third despite enjoying the vast majority of possession, with Eljero Elia finally testing Speroni five minutes before the break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Graziano Pelle, who has summed up Southampton's dip in form, failed to take advantage of the rebound as his personal goal drought extended to 11 league games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The visitors, who were without the suspended Mile Jedinak and Glenn Murray, offered little in response during a drab first half, and were content to defend in numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They claimed that Yannick Bolasie and Dwight Gayle were brought down in the penalty area, although both appeals were muted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This was Alan Pardew's third trip to St Mary's following a 4-0 defeat as Newcastle boss earlier in the season and a win with Palace in the FA Cup in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Yet having soaked up the pressure in the first half, his side became more expansive after the break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>First Jason Puncheon drew a decent stop from Fraser Forster before they created two chances in succession as Bolasie tested the goalkeeper and Zaha hit the post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Sensing a change in the game's flow, Koeman brought on Dusan Tadic from the bench and the Serb almost set up the opener when his corner was flicked on by Pelle with Maya Yoshida unable to guide his touch goalwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But it was Ward-Prowse's intervention which proved decisive as he created the opening for Mane, who scored his sixth goal of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Southampton boss Ronald Koeman: "We needed that three points because you saw today it wasn't the best game we played this season, we didn't create big chances, but we tried and we had the luck and the spirit to win the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's a mental question, the players are maybe a bit less confident and you saw that. We need that confidence to play football. It's one of the key moments of the season with three points and 10 days off, the situation is more comfortable and will be good for the players."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: "In the second half we were the better team and should have taken the lead. We should have had a penalty as well. I think Martin Atkinson should have given a penalty, Jose Fonte was going through the back of people all night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It's so disappointing that we have let in a bit of a soft goal. Julian Speroni is big enough to put up his hands up in the dressing room but we should have stopped it before we got anywhere near there."</td></tr>
