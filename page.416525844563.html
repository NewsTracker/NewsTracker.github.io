<h3>Grizzlies hold off Blazers rally to win 115-109, go up 3-0 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PORTLAND, Ore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Stung by the loss of point guard Mike Conley, the Grizzlies gritted out their latest victory over the Trail Blazers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Memphis took a 3-0 lead in its first-round playoff series against Portland with a 115-109 victory on Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But it came with a cost: Conley left the game in the third quarter with a facial injury and was hospitalized for further evaluation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Grizzlies were already without backup point guard Beno Udrih, who sprained his right ankle in Game 2 and sat out Saturday's game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Game 4 is set for Monday in Portland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''Without Mike, without Beno, I know how competitive we are,'' said Marc Gasol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Gasol finished with 25 points and seven rebounds, while Courtney Lee had 20 points and Zach Randolph added 16 against the team that drafted him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Conley had 14 points before he appeared to be elbowed in the face by Portland CJ McCollum and fell to the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was whisked to the locker room holding a towel to his face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>With Udrih also out, the Grizzlies turned to Nick Calathes, who finished with 13 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Calathes averaged 4.2 points and just over 14 minutes in 52 games during the regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Grizzlies led by as many as 14 points, but Portland closed within 90-82 with 7:28 left after a trio of free throws from Nicolas Batum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gasol responded with two jumpers to end the threat until Arron Afflalo's 3-pointer pulled Portland to 94-87.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Batum's 3-pointer got Portland as close as 94-91 with 2:23 left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But Tony Allen's basket ended Portland's 9-0 run and Randolph added free throws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Allen's fast-break dunk with 1:14 left all but sealed it for the Grizzlies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Batum had another 3-pointer to make it 100-94 but Portland couldn't catch up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''We had the momentum, we hit some shots, the crowd was behind us, and I thought it was going to be one of those games where we find a way to pull it out,'' Blazers coach Terry Stotts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Batum finished with 27 points for the Blazers, who have dropped seven straight games, including four to wrap up the regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>McCollum added 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Memphis made the most of getting home-court advantage for just the second time in the team's playoff history, taking the first two games including Wednesday's 97-82 victory in Game 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Grizzlies have won seven straight against Portland, sweeping the four-game regular season series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Udrih, who had 20 points in the opener, hurt the ankle in the first half of Game 2, but returned in the third quarter and finished with 10 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He warmed up Saturday night but ultimately didn't play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Kosta Koufos made a hook shot that gave Memphis its biggest lead of the first half, 40-28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Memphis went on to lead 62-49 at halftime, scoring 30 points in the paint and shooting 57.5 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>LaMarcus Aldridge struggled from the field in the first half, going just 1 of 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He finished with 21 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Randolph's layup midway through the third put the Grizzlies up 70-56.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''I've got to give credit to Memphis, they definitely forced us into some tough shots,'' Aldridge said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''I was watching film from the first half: Every time I took a shot they had a guy right there, and sometimes three guys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Afflalo returned to the Blazers after missing the first two games of the series with a right shoulder strain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>After coming to the Blazers via a trade with Denver at the deadline, Afflalo was a key contributor when starter Wesley Matthews ruptured his Achilles in March and was lost for the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Grizzlies: The 62 first-half points are a playoff record for the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>... Memphis has never had a 3-0 lead in a playoff series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>... The Grizzlies set a team playoff record by making 39 free throws; their 43 attempts were off of their playoff high of 47.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Trail Blazers: The only time the Blazers have rallied from a 2-0 deficit in a playoff series was in the 1977 NBA Finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>That remains Portland's lone championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>... Blazers backup C Chris Kaman, who missed Wednesday night's game against the Grizzlies because of a left ankle sprain, was listed as questionable for the game but played.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Wesley Matthews came out of the locker room before the rest of the Blazers wearing an ''Iron Man'' mask, in a nod to his nickname, putting the crowd at the Moda Center on its feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The wounded Blazer was walking on his own without the help of the scooter he's used in the past several days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Coach Dave Joerger praised Calathes, who also plays for the Greek national team.</td></tr>
