<h3>Canada votes for air strikes on Islamic State in Syria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OTTAWA: Canadian lawmakers voted on Monday to extend a campaign of airstrikes against the Islamic State group and for the first time strike at them in Syria as well as in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservatives, wielding a majority in the house of commons, pushed through a motion on enlarging the mission in a vote 142 to 129, despite opposition parties' vigorous objections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Our government believes that we must act to protect Canadians against the threat of terrorism at home and abroad," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Canada first joined the US-led airstrikes on the IS group in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Its expanded air campaign was authorized until March 30, 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Harper has defended the need for sorties into Syria, saying the IS group "must cease to have any safe haven in Syria."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He pointed to its movement of heavy equipment across the Iraqi border into Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The prime minister also noted that IS fighters have threatened Canada in propaganda videos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"As a result of ISIL's specific threats against Canada and Canadians, our Government has worked closely for the past six months as part of a broad international Coalition, including our closest allies, to help degrade and disrupt ISIL's ability to inflict harm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>At least six Canadians have died over the last two years fighting alongside extremists in Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the aftermath of two jihadist-inspired attacks in Ottawa and rural Quebec last October, a majority of Canadians have told pollsters they support the military mission against the IS group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Opposition parties, however, warned that airstrikes against the IS group in Syria may implicitly aid Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and embroil Canada in a regional conflict that could drag on for decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>New Democratic Party Leader Thomas Mulcair decried the move "expanding a misguided war in Iraq to a dangerous new phase in Syria."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This is simply not Canada's war to fight," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Canadian airstrikes in Syria are not authorized by the United Nations, nor is it a NATO mission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Canada has also deployed about 70 special forces soldiers to train Kurds in northern Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They came under mortar and machine gun fire while training Iraqi troops near the frontlines in mid-January, and a Canadian soldier was killed by friendly fire on March 6.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Harper said that militarily, the "mission will remain focused on targeting ISIL from the air and advising and assisting Iraqi Forces to fight ISIL more effectively on the ground."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Canadian lawmakers voted on Monday to extend a campaign of airstrikes against the Islamic State group and for the first time strike at them in Syria as well as in Iraq.</td></tr>
