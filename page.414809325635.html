<h3>Samsung Galaxy S6 Has Potentially Fatal Flaw</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>According to Korean publication Itcle, Samsung is planning to give the Galaxy S6 a 2600 mAh capacity battery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This is some 200 mAh smaller than the 2800 mAh battery inside its predecessor, the Galaxy S5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Normally I would kick any suggestion of decreasing smartphone battery capacities into touch, but this latest report follows months of rumours that the S6 battery could be even smaller at just 2550 mAh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>So why would Samsung do this?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Perhaps the biggest reason for fitting a smaller battery in the Galaxy S6 comes down to design.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The new phone will be a radical design departure `from the S5 with an HTC and iPhone 6-aping aluminium unibody chassis as Samsung hopes to wow customers with style.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As part of this design overhaul leaked schematics have shown the S6 will be just 7.19 mm (0.28-inches) thick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This is a significant reduction on the S5 which measures 8.1 mm (0.32-inches) meaning there is less physical space for the battery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It is a well worn argument that many users would rather have slightly thicker phones in exchange for better battery life though, so countering the S6's diet are major TouchWiz changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Here Samsung is expected to make TouchWiz more modular with the ability to uninstall unwanted bloatware as well as streamline the code so it operates faster and more efficiently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>TouchWiz has always been sluggish, so if there are potential battery savings to be made here it may offset the battery capacity decrease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Galaxy S6 will be the first Samsung phone since the S2 to ditch Qualcomm Qualcomm completely for its own range of Exynos chipsets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Previously Exynos chips have been less battery efficient than their Qualcomm equivalents, but Samsung will debut a brand new chipset fabricated at 14nm for the S6 which it claims will greatly improve both speed and efficiency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>If Samsung can pull this off then in combination with the TouchWiz optimisations (and the fact the Galaxy S5 already has excellent battery life) the S6 may well get away with having a smaller battery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Galaxy S5 Vs Galaxy Note 4 Review: Which To Buy?</td></tr>
