<h3>Decision due in Bali Nine death row appeal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan have lost the appeal to challenge their clemency rejections, but their lawyers plan a new battle to keep the firing squad at bay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The appeal in the state administrative court was the pair's last real legal avenue to save them from the firing squad for the 2005 Bali Nine heroin smuggling bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A panel of three judges rejected the appeals on Monday, upholding their earlier decision that presidential clemency can't be considered a state administrative matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran, Leonard Arpan, said their next move would be to challenge the constitutional court to define the president's obligations in relation to clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Indonesia's attorney general has promised to wait for all 10 prisoners in line for the firing squad to run out of legal appeals before setting a date for their executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Arpan says this should extend to the new action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's not over yet," he told reporters after the hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We will submit a constitutional review request to the constitutional court regarding the clemency law that wasn't mentioned in today's hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We demand a clear explanation of the president's obligations in issuing clemency."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We believe we still have to take this action because in this country, no matter what citizen you are, they have the right to defend their lives," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The lawyers have argued that President Joko Widodo erred by rejecting clemency for the men on the basis they were drug offenders, without considering their rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Arpan said the Australians, who await execution on Nusakambangan island, should not be shot in the meantime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"After 10 years, this has been a successful rehabilitation program and it's very regretful if in the end, they must die," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Of course I'm hoping the government still respects any ongoing (legal) procedures."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It's believed the constitutional review request on clemency will be the first of its kind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The administrative court action was also unusual, having only been attempted once before and lost - a precedent raised in the judges' reasoning on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The administrative court had rejected the Bali Nine pair's challenge in February, determining the decrees by Mr Joko were not within its jurisdiction.</td></tr>
