<h3>'Book of Negroes' is a compelling look at a slave's journey</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As a handsome period miniseries, "The Book of Negroes," which premieres Monday on BET and continues through Wednesday, is a first for a network whose original offerings have often seemed something less than ambitious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That the miniseries is Canadian-made, based on a novel by African Canadian author Lawrence Hill, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jamaican-born Canadian director Clement Virgo, is noteworthy but does not diminish the moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>What would PBS be without the BBC?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The series' provenance does mean that, as a story of slavery and escape from slavery, it differs in substance and theme from American tellings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The road here, which begins in Mali in 1761 and ends in London in 1807, runs through snowy Nova Scotia (by way of South Carolina, New York and Sierra Leone); in its recounting of the American Revolution, from the black (and Commonwealth) perspective, the British are better than villains and the colonists not quite heroes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The Book of Negroes," which refers to a historical ledger of colonial African Americans granted freedom by the British for their help in the war, is itself a paean to names, words, storytelling and literacy, as containers of the past, organizers of the present and keys to the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Its heroine is Aminata Diallo (Aunjanue Ellis, "The Help"), the bright, independent child of bright, independent parents; she has been trained as a midwife but dreams of being a jeli, or griot, an oral historian of her people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The first hour, which follows Aminata from Mali to South Carolina, is the series' most original and compelling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It's powered by a deep, serious and at surprising times sweet performance by Shailyn Pierre-Dixon, now 11, who plays the young Aminata.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The scenes in which she is captured and hustled on her way, through one strange experience after another, toward American slavery, have a sharp-focus dreaminess to them, a kind of horrible beauty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>With little exposition, seen as they are from the point of view of one lacking words or context, they feel less played than lived through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As the series progresses and history moves more swiftly by, its points are made more explicitly; the ironies float on the surface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>(Colonial white Americans describe themselves as "slaves" to the British.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>For some characters, the story arcs, whether of sin and redemption or of just desserts finally served, are fairly mathematical - sometimes at the expense of an emotional payoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The story stays novel enough, nevertheless, and the understated tone of the production and performances keep the drama grounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hill and Virgo catch the ordinariness even in the awfulness - the creepy dailiness of the business of slavery, and the capability of those who profit from it to regard themselves just and even tender people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In the same way, to the opposite effects, they allow their protagonists daily lives and love; they are not victims all the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>At the same time, "The Book of Negroes" is an adventure story, a straight-up classic romance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Lyriq Bent plays Chekura, Aminata's longtime love interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The heroine's fearless and clever character, the self-knowledge and self-possession her tormentors lack, and her gift for survival are fixed from first to last.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She is sometimes thwarted but never altered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>If this makes "The Book of Negroes" less psychologically complex than it otherwise might be, there are real pleasures and comforts to be had from it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The most capable woman I've ever seen," New York innkeeper Sam Fraunces (Cuba Gooding Jr.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>, of Fraunces Tavern fame, calls her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>(There is an old tradition, without much scholarly support, that Fraunces, who was nicknamed Black Sam, was of African descent; in any case, Hill goes with it.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Aminata holds on to her name; she trades slap for slap; no one can tell her what to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>She asks George Washington (a bit of an officious boob in this rendering), "Do you think the Negro will one day have his freedom like you Americans?"</td></tr>

<h3>Liberia schools reopen after 6-month Ebola closure</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In the capital, lines formed outside entrances where returning students' temperatures were being taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ebola's main symptom is a high fever, and only those who are sick can spread the deadly virus to others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Deputy Education Minister Remses Kumbuyah said more than 5,000 kits were distributed to schools that included thermometers and chlorine for hand-washing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They should wash their hands in chlorine and they should ensure that there is no touching while on campus," the minister told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are asking all the school administrators to ensure that a classroom should not have more than 45 or 50 students."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Overcrowding is a major problem in Liberia's schools, where as many as 100 pupils may be in a single classroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Since Ebola is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids, administrators want to minimize the potential spread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ebola has killed more than 3,800 people in Liberia, and while only a handful of cases remain health officials have warned that a single new case could trigger a whole new cluster of infections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nearly 9,200 people have died since the first Ebola deaths in rural Guinea in December 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The disease ravaged through Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone - all countries with weak health systems that were ill-prepared for such an epidemic.</td></tr>
