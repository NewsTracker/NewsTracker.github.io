<h3>Cooktown spared as Cyclone Nathan hits</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Category one Cyclone Nathan is expected to turn into a low in the Gulf of Carpentaria off western Cape York in the early hours of Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, the Bureau of Meteorology is warning the storm will intensify into a category two storm as it tracks northwest towards the Top End over the next 36 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A cyclone warning remains from Cape Sidmouth to Cape Melville, including inland areas, and a watch alert is in place for areas between Numbulwar and Maningrida in the NT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Elcho Island, which was ravaged by Cyclone Lam last month, sits within the cyclone watch area for the NT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Forecaster Diana Eadie says it's too early to say exactly where Nathan will end up but conditions in the gulf are favourable for cyclones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There's a possibility that it will impact areas that were hit by Lam but its difficult to pinpoint exactly where," she told AAP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A category two storm would bring winds up to 125km/h and heavy rain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cyclone Nathan was about 55km south-southwest of Coen on Cape York on Friday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It crossed the coast near Cape Flattery, in Queensland's far north, as a category four storm in the early hours of Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The two towns expected to cop the worst of the storm - Hope Vale and Cooktown - were hit with heavy rain and strong winds but escaped relatively unscathed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The worst damage was at a vital banana plantation at Hope Vale where almost half the crop was destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Manager Ken Reid said it was a tough day for the community as the crop had only recently regrown after being destroyed by Cyclone Ita almost a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Dozens spent Thursday night bunkered down in cyclone shelters at Cooktown and Hope Vale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Cooktown resident Jeff Sanders told AAP he spent a comfortable night at the refuge with his wife and three young children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Last night was 100 per cent better than Ita," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We all slept right through the night this time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Residents in Cooktown awoke to find some fences and roofs damaged and branches strewn across streets, but the small town was relatively unscathed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mayor Peter Scott said authorities and residents were well prepared for the storm after being smashed by category four Cyclone Ita in April last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A flooded road into Hope Vale has since reopened and power has been restored to the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The weather bureau says Cape Flattery recorded 167km/h winds on Friday morning while Cooktown was hit by 85km/h winds when Nathan passed by.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Heavy rain and strong winds will continue to batter parts of the Cape York Peninsula on Friday night and Saturday as Nathan moves west.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said earlier on Friday that initial aerial surveillance over the region showed Nathan hadn't caused major damage, and there were no reports of injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It isn't yet known whether a luxury resort at Lizard Island has been damaged but a helicopter was expected to survey the area on Saturday.</td></tr>
