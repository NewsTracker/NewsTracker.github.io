<h3>AP ANALYSIS: US on sidelines of key Iraqi battle against IS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Backed by Shiite militias and Sunni tribal fighters as well as Iranian advisers, the government forces made little progress on the second day of a large-scale military operation to recapture Tikrit, which fell to the Islamic State group last summer, two local officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BAGHDAD (AP) - Iranian-backed Shiite militias and Sunni tribes have joined Iraq's military in a major operation to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown from the Islamic State group, while the U.S.-led coalition has remained on the sidelines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The campaign for Tikrit is a dress rehearsal for the real contest: The fight to recapture Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and the extremists' biggest stronghold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But can a large-scale ground offensive alone succeed, without U.S.-led air support?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Tikrit operation is aimed at stopping Islamic State fighters from closing in on Samarra, a Shiite holy city just to the south that tens of thousands of Shiite militiamen rushed to defend during the extremists' blitz across northern Iraq last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One of the biggest campaigns in the heart of militant-controlled Iraq, the battle for Tikrit involves a complex mix of several Iraqi military brigades and thousands of Shiite militiamen and Sunni tribal fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Directing the offensive with the aid of dozens of Iranian military advisers is a powerful Iranian general, Ghasem Soleimani, commander of the elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Glaringly absent are the U.S.-led coalition forces whose air campaign since last summer has nearly halted the Islamic State rampage across Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Pentagon spokesman Army Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Steve Warren said this week that the U.S. is not providing air power in the Tikrit operation "simply because the Iraqis haven't requested us to."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Liberating the city without the backing of coalition airstrikes will put Iraq's security forces to the ultimate battle-readiness test since any operation to recapture Iraq's densely-populated cities - including Mosul and Fallujah - will have to rely almost entirely on ground forces to minimize civilian casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>However, more of a concern for the U.S.-led coalition is Iran's prominent role in the fight against the Islamic State militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Iran has long been influential in Iraq, but never so much so as over the past year, when the Iraqi military collapsed in the face of the Sunni extremists' onslaught.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Iraqi officials have noted Iran's quick response to their urgent requests for weapons and frontline assistance even as they accuse the coalition of falling short on commitments on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Embedding coalition advisers and forward air controllers - the officers who call in airstrikes - with Iraqi military units presents a twofold challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Frontline positions would put their lives in danger at a time when risk aversion is at its peak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But it also raises the potential for coalition forces and Iranian soldiers to share a battlefield, a politically untenable prospect for the U.S. given the uncertain future of ongoing nuclear talks with Tehran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>However, the U.S.-led mission has hit a roadblock in its efforts to support the Iraqi government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Both the Iraqi and U.S. government agree that airstrikes have pushed the militants back and the group has struggled to gain territory since airstrikes began.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But there will come a point where airstrikes alone will not be enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Most of the battlefield successes in Iraq have been coordinated efforts, with Iraqi and Kurdish forces and Shiite militias fighting on the ground and the U.S.-led coalition providing air power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The siege on the village of Amirli just north of Baghdad, when many feared the capital itself might fall, was broken last year with the help of U.S.-led airstrikes and a fighting force of mainly Shiite militias.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Shiite militiamen backed by a coalition air campaign also retook the town of Jurf al-Sukhr, on Baghdad's outskirts, from the militants in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Soleimani, the Iranian general leading the Tikrit operation, was a key player in both of those campaigns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But Iraqi and Kurdish officials and Shiite militia fighters all acknowledge the crucial role the coalition airstrikes played in their modest victories.</td></tr>
