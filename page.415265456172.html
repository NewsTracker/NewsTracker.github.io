<h3>U.S. charges three in ring that stole 1 billion email addresses</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Justice Department described the hacking spree as "one of the largest" data breaches uncovered in U.S. history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It declined to name the email companies that were victimized, though it appeared that the breaches included a massive 2011 attack on email marketing firm Epsilon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Security blogger Brian Krebs reported that Epsilon, a unit of Alliance Data Systems Corp., was among the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Krebs noted that the government's press release said the data breach "was the subject of a congressional inquiry and testimony before a U.S House of Representatives subcommittee on June 2, 2011."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Epsilon representatives could not be reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Viet Quoc Nguyen, 28, is charged with hacking at least eight email service providers between February 2009 and June 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The government alleges that Nguyen and Giang Hoang Vu, 25, both Vietnamese citizens, used the stolen email addresses to identify tens of millions of people who they targeted in a spam campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The spam emails directed recipients to websites selling software that was falsely branded as Adobe Systems Inc's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Both men resided in the Netherlands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Vu, who was extradited to the United States in March of last year, pleaded guilty on Thursday to conspiracy to commit computer fraud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nguyen remains at large.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The other defendant, Canadian David-Manuel Santos Da Silva, 33, was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He is the co-owner of a company called 21 Celsius Inc., which struck up a marketing arrangement with Nguyen and Vu to generate revenue and launder the proceeds, according to the indictment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Court documents allege that Da Silva and Nguyen received about $2 million in commissions from the sale of the software, which they marketed as Adobe Reader 10 for $65 a copy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Da Silva was arrested at a Florida airport last month and was set to be arraigned on Friday in Atlanta federal court, according to the Justice Department.</td></tr>

<h3>CIA chief orders sweeping changes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Director John Brennan announced the restructuring to the agency's workforce, including a new directorate devoted to boosting the CIA's computer hacking skills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said the move comes after nine agency officers spent three months analysing its management structure, including what deputy director David Cohen called "pain points": organisational areas where the CIA's bureaucracy does not work efficiently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Briefing reporters with Mr Cohen at CIA headquarters this week, Mr Brennan said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the agency is not covering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He lamented that there is often no single person he can hold accountable for the spying mission in any given part of the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There are a lot of areas that I would like to have better insight to, better information about, better access to," Mr Brennan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Safe havens, denied areas. Whether because we don't even have a diplomatic presence in a country, or because there are parts of countries that have been overrun and taken over by terrorist groups and others."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The changes come against a backdrop of evidence that the CIA's focus on hunting and killing terrorists since the September 11 attacks has led to an erosion of the espionage and analytic capabilities the agency built during the Cold War.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The CIA, along with other US intelligence agencies, wrongly assessed the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2002 and failed to anticipate the rapid collapse of Middle East governments during the Arab Spring in 2011, among other shortcomings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The agency's greatest public success of recent years - the 10-year effort to locate and kill Osama bin Laden in 2011 - may have taken longer than it should have, according to evidence made public in the recent Senate report on CIA interrogations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Internal CIA surveys have cited bad management and bureaucratic frustration as factors in driving talent away from the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Under Mr Brennan's reorganisation, the CIA would break down the wall between the operations and analytical arms, a system that typically has required the case officers who recruit spies and run covert operations to work for different bosses, in different offices, to analysts who interpret the intelligence and write briefing papers for the president and other policymakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The new plan would blend practitioners of those separate disciplines into 10 centres devoted to various subjects or areas of the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There are a handful of such centres at the moment, including the Counter Terrorism Centre, where analysts and operators have worked side by side for the last decade targeting al-Qaida with espionage and drone strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Under the new plan, each centre would be run by an assistant director who would be responsible for the entire intelligence mission within that jurisdiction, including covert operations, spying, analysis, liaison with foreign partners and logistics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The system of CIA stations, headed by a CIA station chief, will remain in place, Mr Brennan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Most stations are in US embassies, and various CIA case officers in embassies may be working on different missions for different centres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The changes do not require congressional approval and will be undertaken within the CIA's current budget, CIA officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Critics of a blended approach have raised concerns that combining analysts with operators could compromise the objectivity of the analysts, who are tasked with coldly interpreting intelligence in which they have no stake.</td></tr>
