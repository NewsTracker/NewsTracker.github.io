<h3>AC/DC to put music on Spotify, Apple Music</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The world of streaming is about to get Thunderstruck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Spotify, Rdio and Apple Music will all have AC/DC's music as early as Tuesday, according to The New York Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The decision to join the services is a big deal for the band, who only joined iTunes in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I know the Beatles have changed but we're going to carry on like that," Angus Young told The Guardian in May 2011, after the Beatles released their tracks to iTunes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"For us it's the best way. We are a band who started off with albums and that's how we've always been."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>AC/DC isn't the first rock band to bring their sound to streaming, with Led Zeppelin, Metallica and Pink Floyd all having made their back catalogues available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While they are joining the services, some artists have later opted out of having their music available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Taylor Swift pulled her albums from Spotify earlier this year, arguing that she deserved to get paid for her music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I think there should be an inherent value placed on art," she explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I didn't see that happening, perception-wise, when I put my music on Spotify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Everybody's complaining about how music sales are shrinking, but nobody's changing the way they're doing things," she adds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"They keep running towards streaming, which is, for the most part, what has been shrinking the numbers of paid album sales."</td></tr>
