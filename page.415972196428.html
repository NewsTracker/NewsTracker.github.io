<h3>Ethnic tensions between Israeli Jews fuel Netanyahu victory</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israel's visceral election campaign has exposed a rift that many here thought had long subsided _ the deep-seated schism between Jews of European and Middle Eastern descent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mizrahi, or Middle Eastern, Jews heavily backed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, while Ashkenazi, or European, Jews mostly identified with the opposition Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Hebrew on the photo reads: "Choosing Prime Minister, only Likud only Netanyahu".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>ROSH HA'AYIN, Israel (AP) - Israel's visceral election campaign has exposed a rift that many here thought had long subsided - the deep-seated schism between Jews of European and Middle Eastern descent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That dynamic has been going on for a while but passions have run particularly high this time, with jarring results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Since Netanyahu's win, the sides have been exchanging insults that have not been heard in public in a generation - with the Mizrahi voters accused of being primitive and Ashkenazi voters viewed as elitist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The dispute goes back to Israel's earliest days of independence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Arriving from Arabic-speaking countries in the Middle East and North Africa after Israel's establishment in 1948, many Mizrahi immigrants were sent to shantytown transit camps and largely sidelined by the European leaders of the founding Labor Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They found their political savior in Likud's Menachem Begin - even though he was himself of Polish Jewish descent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With consummate skill the longtime opposition leader cultivated an outsiders' alliance that appealed to their sense of deprivation - and with massive Mizrahi backing he swept to power in 1977 to break nearly 30 years of Labor rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The exact population breakdown is hard to calculate because intermarriage is now quite common.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But Mizrahi or part-Mizrahi Jews make up roughly half of Israel's Jewish population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They have long complained of discrimination by the European-descended elite that traditionally dominated government, military and business institutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The complaints have diminished, as has some of the domination, but gaps remain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>There has never been a Mizrahi prime minister, for example.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mizrahim far outnumber Ashkenazim in prison - and are far outnumbered in academia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They also account for many more poor people - and yet the poorest towns, where they predominate, tend to support Likud and forgive it the capitalist policies than have often not served their economic interests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Our parents and grandparents have voted only Likud since the upheaval" of 1977, said Malkiram Bashari, who traces his roots to Yemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The prospect of voting for Labor?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It's too hard. There is just too much baggage there," said Bashari, 52.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Such sentiments are nothing less than mind-boggling for affluent Ashkenazi voters - who cannot grasp why Mizrahim would support Likud in an election when the country's high cost of living was supposedly a central issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They also often argue that Netanyahu's hard-line policies toward the Palestinians prevent a peace agreement that would bring on an economic boom that would benefit Mizrahim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Yet voting patterns from this month's election indicate that Netanyahu largely owes his re-election to the last-minute mobilization of Likud's Mizrahi supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Many had pledged to turn their back on Likud to protest its economic policies or because of disdain for Netanyahu's lengthy rule and perceived decadent lifestyle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But when the moment of truth arrived - and after Netanyahu sparked turnout by warning of Arab voters coming out in "droves" - poorer, heavily Mizrahi "development towns" voted en masse once more for Likud over the Zionist Union, Labor's modern-day incarnation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In Sderot, for example, a border town with Gaza that has been battered by both rockets and unemployment and has long complained of government neglect, Likud earned 43 percent of the vote, to the Zionist Union's 7 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"The politics of identity are stronger than any economic interest," said Gideon Rahat of Jerusalem's Hebrew University and the Israel Democracy Institute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He said the ethnic vote goes both ways and helps explain why even the wealthiest Ashkenazim continue to vote Labor - which favors high taxes on the rich - rather than the more capitalist Likud.</td></tr>
