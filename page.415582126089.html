<h3>Notre Dame barely avoids another NCAA Tournament bust</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PITTSBURGH - Notre Dame's NCAA Tournament futility under coach Mike Brey was staring it in the face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>These were nervous times for the Irish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Across the floor from No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>3 seed Notre Dame was a fearless, tough-minded Northeastern team making its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1991 and only the eighth in school history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Northeastern's last win in the NCAAs came 31 years ago in the preliminary round against Long Island University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And the way the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>14 seeded Huskies played, it looked for awhile as if they would not leave the building without ending that 31-year drought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the end, Notre Dame survived, winning a stressful 69-65 squeaker in the Midwest Regional second round Thursday at the Consol Energy Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While Brey waited before conducting his post-game interview, he was informed No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>14 seed UAB had upset No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>3 seed Iowa State in a game played simultaneously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"They took the bullet, not us,'' Brey said of Iowa State, the team that upset his Irish in 2013, the last time they were in the NCAAs. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Notre Dame (30-5) has not been to the Sweet 16 since 2003, a constant bone of contention for Brey detractors in South Bend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Irish will play Butler on Saturday with a Sweet 16 berth in the balance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We beat a really good team a really good team,'' Brey said. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That's a great win for us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>I told them in the locker room, 'We weren't going to beat them by 15, so don't anybody walk out of here feeling we should have won by 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Northeastern outrebounded Notre Dame 33-17 in the game (21-7 in the second half) and 13-2 on the offensive glass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The difference for Notre Dame was twofold: Its ability to cause Northeastern turnovers (16) with nine steals, and Zach Auguste, a native of Marlborough, Mass., who led all scorers with 25 points in 27 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Northeastern ended up one possession - and perhaps one timeout - short of either tying the game at the end of regulation and sending it to overtime or winning it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The play of the game turned out to be Jerian Grants strip steal of Northeastern's Quincy Ford with 1.9 seconds remaining and the Irish clinging to a 67-65 lead.</td></tr>

<h3>Healthcare worker in Nebraska tests negative for Ebola</h3>
