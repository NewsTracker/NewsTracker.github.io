<h3>Germanwings flight 4U9525 disaster: Laborious 'black box' inquiry aims to unlock crash cause</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Paris: A warren of laboratories on the outskirts of Paris is where French investigators could face months of laborious and complex detective work to try to establish what caused a German airline disaster in the French Alps that killed 150 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One of the Germanwings Airbus A320's two 'black boxes' was found hours after Tuesday's crash and will come under scrutiny at the spartan offices of France's Bureau d'Enquete d'Accidents (BEA, or office of accident investigations.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>French investigators sift through wreckage at the crash site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A source familiar with the recovery effort said the box found on Tuesday was the cockpit voice recorder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The fate of a separate flight data recorder was not immediately clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The BEA declined to comment ahead of a briefing later on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The black box has been damaged. We will have to put it back together in the next few hours to be able to get to the bottom of this tragedy," French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told RTL radio, adding the box was still viable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The agency's first task will be to establish to what extent the recorder's contents survived the force of the crash, which left a barely recognisable trail of fragments on rocky slopes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This photo provided in Paris by the BEA, the French air accident investigation agency, shows the damaged voice data recorder of the Germanwings jetliner that crashed on Tuesday in the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The 'black box' canisters, which are actually bright orange, are designed to withstand 3400 times the force of gravity on impact as well as extremes of temperature and pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Depending on the type and age of recorder, thermal cladding will be eased out of the box and memory boards taken out of a red plastic sleeve and cleaned, ready for copying and analysis at BEA headquarters in "Building 153" at Le Bourget airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If wet, it may be placed in a warm oven to dry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In the event of damage to its circuitry, it will need careful repairs in the laboratories which have functional work benches alongside state of the art scanners and advanced, high-tech equipment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A rescue worker searches near a piece of fuselage among the debris at the crash site of an Airbus A320, near Seyne-les-Alpes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Modern solid-state flight recorders use crash-survivable digital chips.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But older recorders contained spools of magnetic tape and the BEA's shelves are stacked with vintage recorder parts and reel-to-reel tape decks to help read older machines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It was not immediately clear which type of recording device was installed on the 24-year-old Airbus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A rescue helicopter from the French Securite Civile flies over the French Alps during a rescue operation after the crash of an Airbus A320, near Seyne-les-Alpes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>144 passengers and 6 crew member died when the Airbus A320 slammed into the French Alps at high-speed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Only a handful of people will be allowed to hear the cockpit recordings in a special listening room resembling a recording studio with a multi-track mixer and wall-mounted speakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>To respect the privacy of pilots, rules say the recordings must never be released, but transcripts may be published in the French agency's final report which can take over a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Building those transcripts is not always easy due to cockpit noise or sometimes patchy recording quality, experts say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A badly damaged part of the voice data recorder of the Germanwings jetliner that crashed on Tuesday in the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The recording of each pilot including radio traffic, as well as ambient cockpit sounds, is stored on separate tracks capable of holding up to two hours of audio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Each must be copied, filtered, translated and synchronised to start building an audio picture of what happened inside the Airbus's cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Conversations of crew will provide vital clues, but may not necessarily explain the complex sequence behind most crashes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Crew do not always themselves understand or completely articulate what is going on," said a former crash investigator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>One flight expert said the pilot's priority in an emergency was to aviate, navigate and then to communicate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>France's President Francois Hollande (centre), Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy (right) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel walk on a field near the crash site of Germanwings Airbus A320 near Seyne-les-Alpes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The BEA has called for cameras to be added to cockpits to aid investigations, something pilot unions oppose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>There is also a growing debate over the potential use of live data streaming as an alternative to the decades-old 'black box'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Even so, investigators will listen to engine noise and analyse every alarm, vibration and thump that might help explain what happened shortly after Flight 4U9525 reached cruise height.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The voice recorder is just one part of a massive detective operation, involving analysis of the debris, though most investigators dislike the term, saying they are not policemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>A full anatomy of the Duesseldorf-bound flight depends on finding the flight data recorder, which charts hundreds of parameters that must be downloaded and translated into graphs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Ideally you need it all: both recorders, radar tracks, the wreckage, operational records," the former investigator said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The BEA scanners, x-ray machines and in-house electron microscope are among the industry's most advanced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>But reports from the crash site suggest it will face a huge forensic task in understanding the shroud of debris scattered across ravines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Typically, working groups are set up to focus on areas such as airline operations, maintenance and aircraft systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>A preliminary report may take months and investigations usually take a year or more to run their course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Under international law, France leads the inquiry because the plane crashed there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Germany, which lost some 72 of its citizens, will take part as the airline's home nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Airbus and engine maker CFM will be asked to give technical advice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The crash investigation will try to establish a cause and make any safety recommendations, but will not attribute blame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>That's the task of a judge who on Tuesday carried out the routine step under the French legal system of opening a criminal inquiry: the start of a parallel process that can take years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The 2009 crash of Air France 447, which triggered the BEA's biggest ever investigation, is only now coming to court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived together by helicopter on Wednesday in the remote Alpine region where an Airbus plane smashed into a mountain, ahead of an international tribute to the 150 victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The two leaders were flown over the nearby ravine where the Germanwings airliner came down on Tuesday, Hollande's office said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Spain's Mariano Rajoy later joined them in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes, headquarters of search operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Germanwings said 72 Germans were killed in Tuesday's crash, the first major air passenger disaster on French soil since the 2000 Concorde accident just outside Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Spanish officials said 49 Spaniards were among the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Hollande, Rajoy and a visibly moved Merkel thanked search teams and were due to meet families of victims of the still-unexplained crash, which followed a sharp descent of the Airbus A320.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>A simple tribute was planned later in the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>The ceremony will take place on a site with a view in the distance of the mountain against which the Airbus crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>French officials arranged it to give the families a mental image of the area in which their loved ones died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Earlier Lufthansa said it could not explain why the Airbus run by its low-cost Germanwings unit crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Investigators said the remoteness of the crash site meant it could be days before a clear picture of the tragedy emerged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>However, they said the fact that debris was restricted to a small area showed the A320 was not likely to have exploded in mid-air, suggesting a terrorist attack was not to blame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>"It is inexplicable this could happen to a plane free of technical problems and with an experienced, Lufthansa-trained pilot," Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr told reporters in Frankfurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Lufthansa said the 24-year-old plane had on Monday had repairs to the hatch through which the nose wheel descends for landing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>A spokeswoman said that was not a safety issue but that repairs had been done to reduce noise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Police and forensic teams on foot and in helicopters investigated the site about 100 km north of Nice where the airliner came down en route to Duesseldorf from Barcelona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>"When we go to a crash site we expect to find part of the fuselage. But here we see nothing at all," said pilot Xavier Roy, coordinating air operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Roy said teams of investigators had been dropped by helicopter onto the site and were working roped together at altitudes of around 2000 metres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>It would take at least a week to recover all the remains of the victims, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Beyond Germans and Spaniards, victims included a Moroccan and citizens of Britain, the United States, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, Israel, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, French officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>However DNA checks to identify them could take weeks, the French government said.</td></tr>
