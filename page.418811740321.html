<h3>Martinez outduels Miller, Cardinals beat Braves 1-0 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Atlanta Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez contended Shelby Miller had a better night than Carlos Martinez and the numbers almost backed up that case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>''He outpitched Martinez,'' Gonzalez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Cardinals made the most of two hits and beat the Atlanta Braves 1-0 on Saturday night for their fifth straight win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They lead the majors with a 63-34 record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Pinch-hitter Stephen Piscotty got his first career RBI with a sacrifice fly in the eighth inning and Martinez worked eight innings of six-hit ball against his former team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Manager Mike Matheny said Martinez had perhaps the best sinker ''we've ever seen from him,'' and it led to three of St. Louis' four double plays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''Tonight was big, a fun night to compete against (Miller),'' Martinez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Martinez (11-4) made his first post-All-Star break start and had six strikeouts and one walk, which was intentional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He worked the last four innings and took the loss in an 18-inning setback to the Mets on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Randy Choate got the last two outs for his first save.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Cardinals closer Trevor Rosenthal has gotten two games off after working three straight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Miller (5-7) got a standing ovation from a sellout crowd before his first at-bat and allowed a run and two hits in 7 1-3 innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The right-hander is 0-6 in his last 12 games, the longest winless slump by a Braves starter since Kenshin Kawakami went 14 games between victories in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''It was everything you expected it to be, it was a lot of fun,'' Miller said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Miller shrugged off the winless slump, saying ''That's not a big deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Braves have not scored a run in nine of his starts this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''How much more can he do other than drive in a couple of runs himself?'' Gonzalez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Kolten Wong had a leadoff double in the first and St. Louis didn't get another hit until Yadier Molina opened the eighth with a single.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Randal Grichuk then walked, and Pete Kozma pinch-ran for Molina and advanced on a fly out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kozma beat the throw home from Nick Markakis on Piscotty's flyball to medium right field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''It was just a cool moment and I'm just really glad it came through,'' Piscotty said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Miller retired 12 straight ending the seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The former first-round draft pick of the Cardinals spent his first three seasons with St. Louis before getting dealt to Atlanta in the offseason for outfielder Jason Heyward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The trade came after the death of promising Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Martinez inherited Miller's spot in the rotation, dedicating the season to Taveras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Braves loaded the bases with two outs in the second before Martinez struck out Miller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Braves: Freddie Freeman, activated from the 15-day DL from a wrist injury, flied out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh and finished the game at first base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He had been scheduled to play a second rehab game in Double-A Orlando but that was rained out, so he flew to St. Louis and arrived in the second inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''Hand doesn't hurt at all,'' Freeman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''I was on the phone all morning pleading my case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Cardinals: One sterling rehab start, five innings of no-hit ball, was enough for LHP Jaime Garcia to show he's ready to rejoin the rotation early next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He's been out with a strained left groin since July 4 and will start either Tuesday or Wednesday against Cincinnati.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Braves: Just like Miller, rookie Matt Wisler (4-1, 3.60) will be facing the Cardinals for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Michael Wacha (11-3, 3.20) has 93 strikeouts and needs one more to set a career best.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The Cardinals won with just two hits for the first time since Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>4, 2004, against the Dodgers in a 5-1 win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>They won 1-0 on a sacrifice fly for the first time since July 21, 2004, by Edgar Renteria against the Brewers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>... The Braves have been shut out nine times.</td></tr>
