<tr><td>37</td><td>"It is a victory for the freedom of the press in the face of authorities," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>According to court documents, Mansour was sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison, alongside two Brotherhood members and an Islamic preacher, for allegedly torturing a lawyer in Tahrir Square in 2011, a charge both he and the channel rejects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The court ruled that Mansour and the Brotherhood members had been running and operating a detention center in a travel agency office overlooking Tahrir Square, where hundreds of thousands held a sit-in against longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Mubarak stepped down after the 18-day uprising and the country's first democratic elections were held in 2012, bringing in to office Islamist President Mohammed Morsi of the Brotherhood.</td></tr>

<tr><td>42</td><td>El-Sissi, as army chief, led the July 2013 military ouster of Morsi after massive public protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>A bloody crackdown ensued, killing hundreds of Islamists and landing thousands of them, as well as secular activists, in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The crackdown also included closing down media close to the Islamists and showing little tolerance for critical voices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>An Egyptian prosecutor, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk with the press, said the arrest warrant invoked the international convention against torture.</td></tr>
