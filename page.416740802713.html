<h3>Bill Clinton defends foundation, says nothing 'sinister' at work - VIDEO: Bill Clinton defends charity - MEDIA BUZZ: Hillary is moving left, but she isn&#8217;t divorcing Bill (politically speaking) - VIDEO: Kurtz: Hillary, the 21st century Clinton</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Former President Bill Clinton defended his family's foundation amid mounting conflict-of-interest questions, claiming there's nothing "sinister" at work -- while saying he might consider stepping down as foundation president if his wife wins the presidency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Clinton addressed the issue during an interview aired Monday on NBC's "Today" show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The interview comes as media reports raise questions about donors potentially benefiting from their relationship with the Clintons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Clinton described the criticism as a "very deliberate attempt to take the foundation down."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"And there's almost no new fact that's known now that wasn't known when she ran for president the first time," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As for the foundation's work, Clinton said there's nothing "sinister" in trying to get wealthy people and countries to spend money in a way that helps the poor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea, are on a nine-day tour of Clinton Foundation projects in Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>(That trip, too, has drawn criticism from conservatives, as several donors and Hillary Clinton supporters are traveling in the group, fueling concerns that they're being primed for 2016 fundraising.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In general, critics have raised questions about possible connections between donations made by foreign governments and policies that Hillary Clinton pursued while serving as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Now that Hillary Clinton is running for president, critics have questioned whether long-term political donors are trying to win favor with the politically powerful Clinton family by supporting its charitable arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bill Clinton said 90 percent of donors give $100 or less.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But over half of the donors giving $5 million or more are foreign, including foreign governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Under pressure, the foundation recently announced it will only take money from six Western countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It's an acknowledgment that we're going to come as close as we can during her presidential campaign to following the rules we followed when she became secretary of state," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Clinton also said he will continue to speak at events if asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>When asked whether he would step down as the foundation's president if his wife is elected president, Clinton said he would consider it if asked.</td></tr>
