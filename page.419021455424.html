<h3>Greek stock market reopens with 22 percent plunge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greece's main stock index plunged over 22 percent as it reopened Monday after a five-week closure, giving investors their first opportunity since late June to react to the country's latest economic crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greek bank stocks suffered the most, hitting or nearing the daily trading limit of a 30 percent loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Markets in the rest of Europe, however, were largely unaffected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Athens Stock Exchange and Greek banks were closed on June 29, when the government imposed controls on money withdrawals and transfers to keep a run on bank deposits from causing the financial system to collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Banks have since reopened, while maintaining strict cash withdrawal limits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greece is expected to head back into recession in 2015 - after briefly emerging from a six-year contraction - due to the effects of capital controls and months of uncertainty over the country's future in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A monthly survey of business and consumer confidence, the Economic Sentiment Indicator, fell for a fifth consecutive month in July to its worst level since October 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The negative development is the result of the sharp deterioration in business expectations in all areas, but also a recent and significant decline in consumer confidence," said the Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research, or IOBE, which conducts the survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greece is currently in intense negotiations with bailout lenders in an effort to negotiate the terms of a massive new rescue package in the next two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The country needs to complete the talks and get more loans before Aug. 20, when it has a repayment to make worth more than 3 billion euros to the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Deputy Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas did not comment on reports that Athens could seek a short-term loan to tide it over in case the talks have to be extended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The (negotiation) timetable is truly pressing ... We are preparing for what has been agreed upon, correcting any gaps that may appear," Mardas told private Skai television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Negotiators from the European Union and International Monetary Fund are seeking faster cuts in early retirement plans set out by the government, and stricter conditions for a tax arrears payment program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is facing opposition to the new bailout from within his left-wing Syriza party that could force him to call an early election in the fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Syriza dissenters are openly calling for a return to the drachma, but failed last week to force an emergency party conference before the bailout negotiations are completed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The government has to choose between a humiliating agreement to sign a third bailout, or abandon the agreements reached in Brussels and seek alternatives for a positive course out of this crisis," former welfare minister and prominent dissenter Dimitris Stratoulis said over the weekend.</td></tr>
