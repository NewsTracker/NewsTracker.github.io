<h3>Egypt sentences Mohamed Badie and members of Muslim Brotherhood to death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mohamed Badie was one of 14 members sentenced to life, alongside his deputy Khairat El-Shater and leading Brotherhood figure and lawmaker Mohamed El-Beltagy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr Badie and Mr El-Beltagy both showed their defiance at the verdicts, gesturing behind the heavy screens of their cages to cameras in the Cairo courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Leading Muslim Brotherhood figure Mohamed el-Beltagy gestures from the defendants' cage during his trial at the non-commissioned police officers institute in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Egyptian policemen stand guard in the courtroom in front of the cage holding the defendants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The case stemmed from clashes near the group's headquarters on June 30, 2013, four days before the ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The fighting left 11 people dead and 91 wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The men were accused of murder and possession of firearms, among other charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Other key figures sentenced to life include party head Saad el-Katatni and his deputy, Essam el-Erian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Four lower-level members of the Brotherhood were sentenced to death for inciting the violence in June 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Two of those sentenced to death and three sentenced to life were tried in absentia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The death sentences are subject to appeal and many of the defendants are already serving lengthy sentences on other charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Once the top leader of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, Badie has already been sentenced to multiple life terms, and was one of hundreds given the death sentence in a mass trial that drew international criticism of Egypt's judicial system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some 22,000 people have been arrested since Morsi's ouster, including most of the Brotherhood's leaders, as well as non-Islamist activists swept up by police during protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who as army chief toppled Morsi, describes the Brotherhood as a major security threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The movement says it is committed to peaceful activism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The same day another Egyptian court listed the Palestinian group Hamas as a terrorist organisation, judicial sources said, part of a sustained crackdown on Islamists in the most populous Arab state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Hamas is an offshoot of the Brotherhood, which the authorities have also declared a terrorist group in Egypt and have repressed systematically since the coup against Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>While a court ruled in January that Hamas' armed wing was a terrorist organisation, Saturday's broader ruling against the entire group has potentially greater consequences for the already strained relationship between Cairo and Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip on Egypt's border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>'The Egyptian court's decision to list the Hamas movement as a terror organisation is shocking and is dangerous, and it targets the Palestinian people and its factions of resistance,' Hamas said in a statement after the ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'It will have no influence on the Hamas movement,' Hamas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>After the January decision against Hamas' Qassem Brigades, a source close to the armed wing signalled the group would no longer accept Egypt as a broker between it and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Cairo has for many years played a central role in engineering ceasefires between Israel and Hamas, including a truce reached between the sides in August that ended a 50-day Gaza war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A spokesman for the Egyptian government declined to say what actions the government would take to enforce the ruling.</td></tr>
