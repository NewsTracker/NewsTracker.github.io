<h3>Here's what's happening to Crimea a year after Russia annexed it</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>One year after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops to secure what Ukrainian and Western observers say was a sham referendum - which was followed by a March 18 decree formally absorbing the region - most locals apparently still approve (publicly, at least) of their new master.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It helps, of course, that Russian state television, the main source of information for some 90 percent of the population, continues to herald the annexation as a heroic move that prevented alleged Ukrainian "fascists" from seizing power there and "oppressing" Russian-speakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The day-to-day reality, though, is not so rosy: In Crimea, a sense of international isolation is deepening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The local economy is suffering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A political crackdown continues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>To be fair, the state of affairs in mainland Ukraine is less than stellar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ukrainian government forces are still battling Moscow-backed rebels, while officials are relying on Western creditors to bail out their ailing economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Still, many critics say Crimea under Russian rule isn't exactly better off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Things get complicated when you're trying to operate your business in an internationally contested region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Only a handful of countries - among them Syria, North Korea and Afghanistan - believe Crimea belongs to Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The rest of the world recognizes the peninsula as a Ukrainian territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Visa, MasterCard and online payment system PayPal have all pulled out of Crimea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That's probably why Visa, MasterCard and online payment system PayPal have all pulled out of Crimea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Add to that list Apple, which has cut support for local developers and stopped selling its products, and even McDonald's (Don't worry, though: You can always enjoy RusBurger.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That's on top of concerns over rising inflation - which in January was said to have represented the world's second-highest rate - for even the most basic goods, like food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It's difficult enough that Crimea shares only a narrow land border with Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The authorities in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv have blocked train and bus service to the peninsula, which means air and ferry travel are the next best options for mass transit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>(Cars are still allowed through.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Unfortunately, though, the ferry has limited capacity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>That proved a major problem during last year's summer holiday season, Crimea's most economically important time of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A Russian low-cost airline briefly serviced the region, but it was forced to suspend flights last summer thanks to Western sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>(Flights on more expensive standard Russian airlines are still available.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Luckily, a close Putin confidante won a $3 billion contract earlier this year to build a major bridge over the Kerch Strait, which would connect Crimea to southern Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But that won't be built at least until 2018.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The peninsula's remoteness also means it still depends on Ukraine for its water and electricity supplies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>There's more bad news here, too: Kyiv has drastically cut supplies of both, resulting in sporadic blackouts and irrigation problems for local farmers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Russia's annexation of Crimea was accompanied by a state propaganda campaign that delivered one key message: The Ukrainian government is bad, and Russia is here to help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>That message hasn't changed much since, and anyone who begs to differ appears to be unwelcome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Last week alone, the registered homes of two investigative journalists were raided by Russian security officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>One of the reporters was briefly detained by officers from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) - the successor to the KGB - without explanation, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But that's just one small part of the crackdown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Tatar Muslims have been persecuted and forced to leave Crimea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Some members of the Crimean Tatar community, a Muslim minority group, have been forced out of the region by the local Moscow-backed authorities, persecuted or even mysteriously kidnapped, reportedly in retaliation for their pro-Ukraine stance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>These days, even displaying the Ukrainian flag will earn you charges of "extremism," the Guardian newspaper recently reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"The attitude of the de facto Crimean authorities, and their Russian masters, to their opponents is simple: leave or shut up," rights watchdog Amnesty International wrote in a report on rights abuses in Crimea, released Wednesday.</td></tr>

<h3>Accused murderer Robert Durst deemed 'suicidal'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Robert Durst, the real estate scion charged with first-degree murder, is suicidal, according statements by Louisiana authorities released on Wednesday after they moved him to a facility for inmates suffering from acute mental illness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Awaiting extradition to California, the 71-year-old Durst was charged this week in Los Angeles County with killing longtime friend Susan Berman in 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He could face the death penalty if convicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In law enforcement's sights for decades, Durst has been the focus of investigations across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Three of Durst's condominiums in Houston were searched on Tuesday, and there have also been investigations in northern California, where the disappearances of two teenagers in 1997 raised questions about his whereabouts at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The heir to a New York real estate dynasty was arrested in New Orleans on Saturday with a handgun, marijuana, a fake ID and over $42,000 in cash, records show, one day before the airing of the final installment of an HBO documentary, "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In it, Durst was presented with evidence of similar handwriting on two envelopes, one from himself and another that likely originated from Berman's killer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Durst's voice was later picked up, while he was still wearing a microphone in the bathroom, saying that he had "killed them all."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Durst was acquitted in 2003 in the killing of a male neighbor in Texas, whose body was dismembered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was also a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen Durst, in 1982.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office said in a court filing on Tuesday it had "determined that, as with all other inmates who are deemed suicidal, Mr. Durst should be transported ... for his own safety."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Durst's attorneys sought to have him kept in a New Orleans jail as he awaits a hearing on Monday on local weapons charges, but a Louisiana appellate court found he could be moved to a facility about 70 miles away, court documents show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Durst's Houston condominiums were searched by authorities with court documents showing they were looking for handwriting samples and other evidence linking him to Berman's killing and his wife's disappearance, as well as signs he might try to flee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>According to a search warrant affidavit released on Wednesday, a document examiner for the Los Angeles Police Department initially thought writing on an anonymous letter to authorities stating the location of Berman's body belonged to another man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But upon later review of Durst's handwriting, the analyst revised that view, determining in June 2003 that Durst was the likely author.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In northern California, police investigating the disappearance of 16-year-old Karen Mitchell want more information about when Durst was in Eureka, the city's police chief told NBC News on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He added that no direct tie between Durst and the case has been found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Bob Modafferi, father of Kristen Modafferi, who went missing while visiting San Francisco when she was 18, told the New York Daily News he wants to talk to the FBI about Durst, saying that if he was in the area "it raises a bunch of potential red flags and questions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Authorities in Eureka and San Francisco did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.</td></tr>
