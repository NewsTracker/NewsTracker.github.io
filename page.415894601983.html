<h3>Nepal official says climbers are returning to Mount Everest after last year's deadly avalanche</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal - Climbers are returning to Mount Everest as the climbing industry recovers from last year's deadly disaster on the world's highest peak, a Nepalese mountaineering official said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Climbers from four teams have already been issued permits allowing them to climb the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) peak, another 11 written applications are pending and more applications are expected in the next few days, said Gyanendra Shrestha, an official at Nepal's Mountaineering Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Last year's disaster has not deterred the climbers from coming back, instead, we are expecting more than 40 teams during the season," Shrestha said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That compares with 31 teams last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was feared that the deaths of 16 local Sherpa guides in an avalanche that led to the early end of the 2014 climbing season would keep climbers away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Following the accident, other guides refused to work and climbers had to abandon their bids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nepal's government, which makes millions in permit fees, has been attempting to lure the climbers back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It recently said that mountaineers forced to abandon last year's climb would have their permits extended to 2019.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As well, mountaineering authorities have pledged to improve weather forecasting, security and rescue efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>More medical staff has been placed at Mount Everest's base camp, and the government has set up a full-time office tent at the camp, with officials providing security, settling disputes among climbers and monitoring the activities of the hundreds of climbers and guides at the camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nepal was criticized last year for not having a rescue plan for disasters and for not having a government presence at the base camp despite charging climbers huge permit fees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>More than 4,000 climbers have Mount Everest since 1953, when it was first conquered by New Zealand climber Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Hundreds of others have died while attempting the climb.</td></tr>
