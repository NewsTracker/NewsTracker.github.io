<h3>Eagle captures views of Dubai soaring from Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest tower</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The imperial eagle, called Darshan, had a camera attached to its back as it swooped 2722 feet (830 metres) from the top of Dubai's Burj Khalifa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It captured phenomenal views of the capital of the United Arab Emirates before landing on the arm of its trainer, falconer Jacques-Olivier Travers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Freedom Conservation, the group which organised the attempt, claim it is the highest-ever recorded bird flight from a man-made structure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The white-tailed eagle, which has been critically endangered for more than 50 years, has previously flown from the top of St Paul's Cathedral in London and the Eiffel Tower in France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ronald Menzel, director of Freedom Conservation, said the organisation filmed yesterday's bird flight in an attempt to draw more attention to eagle conservation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the clip, which lasts nearly two minutes, the bird takes off from the tower and soars over Dubai, allowing the camera to record stunning aerial views.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The camera - a Sony Action Cam Mini - weighed approximately 300g, which is about 10 per cent of the bird's weight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Upon landing on the arm of its trainer, Mr Travers could be seen punching the air with joy before describing the flight as 'perfect'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He said: 'This was an incredible challenge and the most difficult of my career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'Not only is this the highest vertical flight that has ever been done, but the eagle also had to fly in a totally different environment, with strong wind disturbances caused by the skyscrapers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'This flight will create huge possibilities for future conservation programs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Travers developed his passion for birds at the age of 12, after being given small chicks from a nest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He began training Darshan after selecting him from a breeding facility in Thonon, France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Last year, he completed several successful big flights with his bird of prey including one from the Golden Gallery at St Paul's Cathedral to the base of London's famous Tower Bridge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>During the flight over central London in November last year, the eagle captured breath-taking footage of the capital and the River Thames with a high-spec camera mounted on its back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At the time, Mr Travers said: 'I like to bring the birds where they are not expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In another impressive flight just a month earlier, Darshan soared from the top of the 206-metre observation deck of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The bird was released from the inconic structure by its handler, before flying over the River Seine and down into the Trocadero Gardens at 111 miles per hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Darshan is a white imperial eagle, a bird which was once on the Red List of endangered species but has since been saved from extinction.</td></tr>

<h3>American who contracted Ebola now in critical condition</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The NIH said the patient was flown in isolation from Sierra Leone on a chartered plane last week and arrived at an NIH hospital near Washington early Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The patient's name, age and gender have not been released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The person is a clinician working with Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The group has been treating patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone since November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The latest NIH patient is the 11th person with Ebola to be treated in the U.S. Two patients in the U.S. have died: a man treated in Dallas after contracting the virus in Africa and a doctor evacuated from Africa to Nebraska when he was already critically ill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The man in Dallas had contracted the virus in his native Liberia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He transmitted the disease to two nurses, resulting in widespread concern in the U.S., with questions raised about emergency department screening of patients, monitoring of ill travelers from Africa and even disputes over the disposal of potentially infectious waste from hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The World Health Organization has estimated the virus has killed more than 10,000 people, mostly in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The current outbreak is the largest ever for the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While deaths have slowed in recent months, the virus appears stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman said that besides the patient at NIH, there are 11 other Partners in Health workers being brought to the United States for monitoring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That includes four going to Atlanta to be near Emory University Hospital; one arrived Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Saturday, four health care workers arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, and three arrived in the Washington area on Sunday to be near the NIH campus in Bethesda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>One of those being monitored in Nebraska has developed symptoms of Ebola and was being moved to a biocontainment unit, hospital officials said in a news release Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, none of those being monitored has tested positive for Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The National Institutes of Health said it has no other pending admissions of additional patients with the Ebola virus or who have been exposed to Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>CDC workers in Sierra Leone are involved in investigating the illness of the first patient, including looking for other people the person was in contact with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It's possible other people will be transported to the United States for monitoring, said the spokesman, Tom Skinner.</td></tr>
