<h3>Flooding in Small Pacific nation of Vanuatu as cyclone hits maximum strength</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Aid agencies said many people living in flimsy slum accommodation were particularly at risk in the poor Pacific nation of 270,000 people, as well as those in remote outlying islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The cyclone was expected to track 100 kilometres off the island nation&#x2019;s east coast on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Vanuatu&#x2019;s meteorology service said residents should still brace for winds of 102mph along with flash flooding, landslides and &#x201c;very rough to phenomenal seas&#x201d;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Alice Clements, Unicef spokesman, said Port Vila resembled a &#x201c;ghost town&#x201d; as people battened down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>&#x201c;Tonight is really the night we&#x2019;re going to find out,&#x201d; the official with the UN children&#x2019;s agency told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>&#x201c;The winds have definitely increased, the palm trees are blowing around like crazy, you&#x2019;re starting to get that kind of howling wind coming through,&#x201d; she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ms Clements said there was little hope that the cyclone might make a late change of course and largely spare Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re super unpredictable but the centre of the storm is tracking really close by, so even if it&#x2019;s not a direct hit there&#x2019;s going to be really significant impacts,&#x201d; she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tom Skirrow, Save the Children&#x2019;s Vanuatu director, said up to 50,000 children were at risk in the nation, where two-thirds of the population rely on subsistence agriculture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>&#x201c;We have been going door-to-door in some of the poorest slum areas and I&#x2019;m hugely concerned that not enough is being done to make sure children and families are safe as this huge storm approaches,&#x201d; he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>&#x201c;Thousands of families are living in makeshift, flimsy houses which will not withstand the immense winds and rain we&#x2019;re expecting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Meteorologist Neville Koop from Fiji&#x2019;s Nadraki Weather Service said Pam&#x2019;s winds were capable of bringing down even well-built structures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said they could be more destructive than Cyclone Uma in 1987, which killed at least 30 people when it sank two ferries off Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>&#x201c;Pam has winds which are much stronger than Vanuatu experienced&#x201d; in 1987, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Julie Bishop, Australian foreign minister, issued a statement urging citizens &#x201c;to reconsider your need to travel&#x201d; to Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>&#x201c;We are monitoring the humanitarian impact closely and are preparing a potential response to this emergency,&#x201d; Ms Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Cyclones, known as hurricanes in the northern hemisphere, are a common occurrence in the South Pacific at this time of year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tropical Cyclone Lusi swept across Vanuatu in March last year, killing 11 people and damaging crops and infrastructure.</td></tr>
