<h3>North Carolina holds off Harvard 67-65 in NCAA Tournament (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- North Carolina was supposed to be too big, talented and versatile, and at times the Tar Heels lived up to their pregame billing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was just enough to squeak by Harvard, one tough out in the NCAA Tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Justin Jackson hit a tying jumper in the final minute, and then had a fast-break dunk to help the fourth-seeded Tar Heels edge the Crimson 67-65 on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''It's the luckiest I've ever felt after a basketball game in my entire life,'' North Carolina coach Roy Williams said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Tar Heels (25-11) wasted a 16-point lead in the second half and briefly trailed before Jackson came to the rescue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Next up is Arkansas, which advanced with a 56-53 victory over 12th-seeded Wofford.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Siyani Chambers' four-point play put Harvard ahead 65-63 with 1:15 remaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It was the only lead of the game for the 13th-seeded Ivy League champions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jackson finished with 14 points and Marcus Paige had 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''Marcus made two big shots and Justin made two big shots,'' Williams said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''If we had played a little bit better, it may not have required that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Chambers misfired on a pair of 3-pointers in the closing seconds, and the Crimson's final chance for victory - Wesley Saunders' shot from beyond the arc - bounced off the back of the rim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Saunders led Harvard (22-8) with 26 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Chambers had 13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''Can't say enough about the effort that our kids put forth, the battle to get back in it,'' Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''I thought we played with great poise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Wesley Saunders and Siyani, these guys are the two main guys that do everything for our ballclub, carried us to put us in a position to have a chance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>North Carolina lost six of 10 down the stretch, but has played considerably better in the postseason, beginning with three wins on the way to the championship game of the ACC Tournament, where the Tar Heels lost to Notre Dame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''We just have to go back to doing that,'' North Carolina forward Brice Johnson said of the way the team played last week in Greensboro, N.C. ''We kind of got away from it and let our guard down for a second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Isiah Hicks played some key minutes in the first half for the Tar Heels, with the reserve making all four of his shots and grabbing three rebounds in the first 20 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>His three-point play restored a double-digit lead after Harvard trimmed what was once a 14-point deficit to 26-23.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>North Carolina led 36-25 at halftime, and Jackson made a 3-pointer coming out of the break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It looked as if the Tar Heels might run away when they built a 16-point lead with under 17 minutes to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But the Crimson kept their poise and clawed back into the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Two free throws from Steve Moundou-Missi cut North Carolina's lead to one with 3:39 left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Paige gave the Tar Heels some breathing room with a 3-pointer, but Harvard refused to crack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Saunders hit a jumper and, with the clock winding down and Harvard fans urging Chambers to stop dribbling and shoot, the junior guard made a 3 and was fouled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Jackson answered on the other end with his big jumper, and then scored the go-ahead basket with 22 seconds remaining after North Carolina rebounded Chambers' miss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''I always think, 'Next play.' I had four stupid turnovers, but Coach always talks about 'Next play,' and that was the play,'' Jackson said, describing the tying shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Jackson stepped up in the end, but he still got an earful from Williams in the locker room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''I've got a guy that made his last two shots and should be on top of the world, and I was screaming at him and the whole bit,'' the coach said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''I feel like I've won the lottery because Tommy Amaker did a much better job with his team than I did with mine,'' Williams added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Harvard: The Crimson won their opening game in the tournament the past two years, upsetting New Mexico in 2013 and Cincinnati last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>North Carolina: The Tar Heels, making their 46th appearance, improved to 111-43 in the NCAA Tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>... Williams is leading a team in the tourney for the 25th time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Saunders made 8 of 14 shots, proving to be a tough matchup for North Carolina defensively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>''We thought we had a strategy for him, but it didn't work,'' Williams said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Harvard has won five consecutive Ivy League titles and will have three returning starters next season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>North Carolina takes on Arkansas on Saturday.</td></tr>

<h3>Fraser and Gough - rising above bitterness</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a book that questioned the wisdom of political allegiances, the former Liberal prime minister's message to his one-time Labor nemesis was testimony to the strength of one of Australia's most unlikely friendships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr Fraser, who died on Friday aged 84, was the man who precipitated the most notorious event in Australian political history: the 1975 dismissal of the Whitlam government by Governor-General John Kerr.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Remarkably, and baffling for many, Whitlam and the man he branded "Kerr's cur" built a relationship after politics based on their shared values and vision of what sort of nation Australia might become.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Eric Sidoti, director of the Whitlam Institute and former executive director of the Human Rights Council of Australia, said Mr Whitlam showed him the Fraser inscription last July, during one of his regular visits before the Labor icon's death in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He pushed the book across to me and said `read the inscription'," Mr Sidoti said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It struck me at the time that it just captured so much about how big they both were - they were big men with big hearts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It was an absolute lesson in rising above bitterness."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 1975 dismissal scored deep divisions into Australian society and even now many people "maintain the rage" as Mr Whitlam urged them to do 40 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Whitlam biographer Jenny Hocking says both men were able to separate the political and the personal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Whitlam formed the view that Mr Fraser's blocking of supply was part of politics and parliamentary strategising, Professor Hocking says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I think you can safely say Whitlam never forgave John Kerr but he could with Fraser because he put that in the box of political activity," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>By the mid 1980s there was a thaw in the relationship and Fraser and Whitlam made their first joint public appearance when they shared a stage in 1991 at a Melbourne rally against concentration of media ownership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"At the time this was seen as a very public reconciliation and it was a sign of how their politics had moved together," Prof Hocking said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Fraser quit the Liberal Party in 2009, saying it had become conservative rather than liberal, but Prof Hocking says Mr Fraser underwent a shift in his politics and drew closer to Mr Whitlam - though not on all points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Prof Hocking asked Mr Whitlam once about his relationship with Mr Fraser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"He said to me: `Well, Malcolm has improved'."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Fraser shared views with Mr Whitlam more than many realise: the Fraser government carried on with some of the key reforms introduced by the Whitlam government in areas including Aboriginal land rights and multiculturalism - to the discomfort of some in the Liberal ranks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>When the Whitlam Institute established its Gough Whitlam Oration series in 2011, the first lecture was by Julia Gillard; the second, in 2012, was delivered by Mr Fraser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr Fraser spoke on Politics, Independence and the National Interest and said of his old rival: "As political antagonists we had substantial differences, but as Australians we had shared interests and concerns".</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While Prof Hocking characterises their relationship as "a political rapprochement", Mr Sidoti believes it was a true friendship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In recent years, the two would meet whenever Mr Fraser was in Sydney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Their relationship was quite remarkable and very genuine," he said.</td></tr>
