<h3>THE LATEST: Europe, US Are Likely Bidders for 2026 World Cup</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA will let Europe bid for the 2026 World Cup despite comments by FIFA chief Sepp Blatter that it would be too soon after Russia hosts the 2018 tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Instead, FIFA's executive committee on Saturday kept an existing rule blocking continents from hosting back-to-back World Cups - so Asia would be excluded in 2026, since Qatar is hosting the 2022 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The European soccer body UEFA is locked in a power struggle with world soccer regulator FIFA after most European nations backed Blatter's opponent in the presidential race that Blatter won Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>UEFA members are meeting next Friday to agree on ways to oppose Blatter's FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The CONCACAF region - including potential bidders the U.S., Canada and Mexico - believes it deserves to host the 2026 tournament, since it has not had a World Cup since 1994 in the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Newly re-elected FIFA President Sepp Blatter was typically defiant in his first news conference since an American investigation into corruption reportedly uncovered $150 million in bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Arrested for what? Next question," Blatter dismissed curtly, when asked if he feared where the U.S. federal case was heading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Was he the "high-ranking FIFA official" mentioned in the U.S. indictment who wired $10 million for apparent bribes to corrupt CONCACAF officials so they would vote for South Africa as the 2010 World Cup host?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Definitely that is not me," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I have no $10 million."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Blatter, 79, has largely avoided engaging with media this year as he sought re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After winning a closer vote than he would have liked Friday for a fifth four-year term, he came out fighting Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I have especially no concerns about my person," he said about an investigation that U.S. federal agencies said is just starting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The U.S. indictment Wednesday detailed bribery and racketeering over a 24-year period linked to awarding television rights in North and South America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Seven FIFA officials are in a Zurich jail, with U.S. officials eager to extradite them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>FIFA is keeping the continental quotas of World Cup qualifying places for two more tournaments - those in 2018 in Russia and in 2022 in Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>FIFA President Sepp Blatter says the executive committee declined to make any changes at a meeting Saturday in Zurich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Blatter had earlier encouraged other regions to seek more places, likely at Europe's expense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The decision means European soccer body UEFA keeps its 13 qualifying slots, plus host Russia, at the 32-team tournament in 2018.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Europe will have 13 teams at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Besides those places, Africa has five guaranteed spots, Asia and South America have four each, and there are three spots for the CONCACAF region of North and Central America and the Caribbean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Two more places are decided in playoffs involving teams from Asia, CONCACAF, Oceania and South America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In heavyweight boxing terms, you can't get bigger than FIFA vs. UEFA.</td></tr>
