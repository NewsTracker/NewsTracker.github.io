<h3>Fellaini goal earns Belgium 1-0 win over Israel</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Marouane Fellaini grabbed an early goal as 10-man Belgium survived Israel's spirited second-half performance to earn a 1-0 win in Euro 2016 qualifying Group B in Jerusalem on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Belgium dominated the first half but could not capitalise beyond Fellaini's close-range effort in the ninth minute when he was teed up by captain Vincent Kompany who was later sent off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The visitors lacked urgency for the rest of the match and almost paid a high price for failing to increase their lead when defender Kompany was dismissed in the 64th for a second booking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Israel, who struggled to find an opening against stout Belgian defending until Kompany's departure, then found gaps and created chances, though most of their efforts were wayward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The fixture was the only Euro qualifier of the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was scheduled to be played last September but had to be postponed because of the war between Israel and Gaza militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Belgium leapfrogged Israel to move top of the group, ahead of second-placed Wales on goal difference with both teams on 11 points from five matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Israel are third, with nine points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Belgium coach Marc Wilmots said his team did enough to get the result but the performance could have been better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"My players came to this away match and they knew what they had to do to get the three points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We did look a little tired in the second half and we will have to see how we deal with this in our upcoming matches."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Israel coach Eli Guttman rued his side's missed chances after Saturday's 3-0 defeat at home Wales and said their next match in Bosnia on June 12 would be crucial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I was heartened by our play. We were worth a goal today and that is a great miss. A 1-1 draw would have been a just result. Our away match against Bosnia has now become the most important for us in the competition, that is clear," he said.</td></tr>
