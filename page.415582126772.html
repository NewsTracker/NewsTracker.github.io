<h3>Greece looms over EU summit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In many ways, this EU summit is a haunting reminder for the participants of the worst days of the Greek debt crisis several years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After two bailout programs and a partial debt relief deal, Greece once again is threatened by bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It could be only weeks away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The big difference between then and now is that today the leftist Greek government under Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is doing all it can to put off its creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greek politicians have not only reviled the German government and the Troika team of auditors from the EU, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tsipras is also implementing pieces of legislation that run contrary to agreements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>With his "humanitarian crisis" bill he is offering free electricity and food stamps to the needy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That may be understandable from a social point of view, and it is certainly popular in Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The EU, however, wants to have a say in the way its money is spent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>No wonder tensions are high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>EU Council President Donald Tusk fears they might dominate the Brussels summit completely, and therefore he has relegated to the sidelines of the summit a special meeting between Tsipras, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and top EU officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>For some, holding this exclusive meeting outside the normal summit schedule is a dangerous split.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel has complained that small countries like his own were not invited, although they have contributed to the bailout programs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Tusk, as summit host, has a difficult job on his hands and has tried to downplay the importance of the talks on Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Chancellor Merkel meanwhile - who will also meet Tsipras in Berlin on Monday - has made it clear that neither the Brussels nor the Berlin meeting will bring a decision on Greece's acute financial problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>For her, as well as for practically everybody else except Mr Tsipras, it is now up to the Greeks to fulfill the conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Greek leader had some sympathy initially when he came to power, but has now become totally isolated on the Brussels stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As this Greek tragedy unfolds - some would even call it a parody - it is already overshadowing other issues at the summit, like dealing with Russia and Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>EU leaders will probably keep existing sanctions against Russia in place as long as the Kyiv ceasefire agreement is fully working.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They also want to create an energy union to reduce dependence on Russian energy imports, and work on details of a planned massive EU investment program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>All this, however, could move to second place now that the Greek crisis is getting more dramatic by the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned German parliamentarians not to expect a quick solution to Greece's dispute with international creditors over its debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>She was speaking to the Bundestag ahead of an EU summit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Greek premier Alexis Tsipras has asked for a meeting with counterparts on the sidelines of an EU leaders' meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>However, Tsipras sounded a note of defiance in advance, vowing that his government would end austerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Greek lawmakers have adopted a "humanitarian crisis" bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It's the biggest package of social measures put forward by the new government so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Instead of looking at plans for a European Energy Union, an EU summit later this week is set to deal with Greece and its financial woes yet again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Bernd Riegert filed this report from Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras defended his so-called humanitarian law on Thursday as the first bill drawn up by Athens in five years, rather than ordered by E.U. technocrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker urged all parties involved in solving the crisis to "get a grip".</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Following emergency talks with German and French leaders, Greece has agreed to submit a reform list "within days."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has urged the two leaders to help tackle a looming financial crisis.</td></tr>
