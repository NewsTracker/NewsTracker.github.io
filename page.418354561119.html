<h3>Greece gets until Sunday for proposals to stave off collapse</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BRUSSELS - Frustrated and angered eurozone leaders gave Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras a last-minute chance Tuesday to finally come up with a viable proposal on how to save his country from financial ruin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Overcoming their surprise when Tsipras failed to present them with a detailed plan, the leaders reluctantly agreed to a final summit Sunday, saying that could give both sides an opportunity to stave off collapse of the struggling but defiant member nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Underscoring the gravity of the challenge, European Union President Donald Tusk decided to call all 28 EU leaders to Brussels instead of only the 19 eurozone members, because, for the bloc, it "is maybe the most critical moment in our history."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>French President Francois Hollande agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's not just the problem of Greece - it's the future of the European Union" that's at stake, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We'll see if on Sunday this issue will be solved once and for all," Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>With Greece's banks just days away from a potential collapse that could drag the country out of the euro, Tsipras arrived with only vague proposals and a commitment to back it up with real figures and a more detailed plan by Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Speaking to reporters late Tuesday, Tsipras said he made proposals to the leaders during the evening summit but it was unclear whether it meant anything more than the general direction of staving off too tough austerity and insisting on debt restructuring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Yet he made clear he had gotten the message that there wasn't a moment to waste as deadlines for debt payments that Greece cannot afford draw near.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The process will be swift, it will be speedy, it will begin in the next few hours with the aim of concluding until the end of the week at the latest," Tsipras said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But patience among Greece's allies was wearing very thin ahead of the meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"You know, there was a promise for today. Then, they're promising for tomorrow," said Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tsipras came buoyed by a triumph in last Sunday's referendum, where an overwhelming majority of Greeks backed his call to reject the belt-tightening reforms that creditors had last proposed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But that domestic victory did not appear to give him much leverage in talks with foreign creditors, who know Tsipras needs a deal soon to keep his country afloat.</td></tr>
