<h3>Colorado shooting defendant James Holmes called ?psychotic? by his attorney</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this image taken from video, accused Colorado theater shooter James Holmes, background left, listens to lead prosecutor George Brauchler give closing arguments during his trial, in Centennial, Colo., Tuesday, July 14, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On the screen is a photo of the youngest victim, Veronica Moser-Sullivan, who died while at the theater with her pregnant mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In this July 23, 2012 file photo, James Holmes, who is charged with killing 12 moviegoers and wounding 70 more in a shooting spree in a crowded theater in Aurora, Colo., in July 2012, sits in Arapahoe County District Court in Centennial, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jurors in the Colorado theater shooting case soon will retreat into the largest jury room in the courthouse to determine whether Holmes was legally insane at the time of the killing spree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In this July 20, 2012 photo, Tom Sullivan, center, embraces family members after losing his son Alex when James Holmes opened fire in a packed Aurora movie theater, killing 12 and wounding 70, in Aurora, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>When James E. Holmes entered a suburban Denver movie theater he had lost touch with reality, was obviously psychotic and not responsible for opening fire in a deadly mass murder spree, his attorney said Tuesday in the defense's closing argument.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Daniel King said Holmes had been mentally ill even before the 2012 attack on the movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and urged the jurors to look beyond how the gunman planned his attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The prosecution had earlier argued that the deliberate nature of the planning and execution of the attack showed that Holmes was not mentally ill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There isn't a lot of logic in what Mr. Holmes did," King said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"That's because he is mentally ill. | It's not logical. It defies the logical process. It's psychotic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>King and Arapahoe District Attorney George Brauchler squared off in their final arguments in the death penalty case that hinges on the mental state of Holmes and whether he could tell right from wrong when he opened fire on the audience at the midnight showing of the Batman movie "The Dark Knight Rises" on July 20, 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Twelve people were killed in the attack and 70 wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"That guy was sane beyond a reasonable doubt, and he needs to be held accountable for what he did," Brauchler told the jurors in his closing argument.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Jurors were scheduled to begin deliberations on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>When the audience of more than 400 people entered the theater, "they came in hoping to see the story of a hero dressed in black, someone who would fight insurmountable odds for justice," Brauchler said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Instead, a different figure appeared by the screen. | He came there with one thing in his heart and his mind, and that was mass murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"When he goes into that theater he intends to kill everybody he can," Brauchler told the jurors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"He creates a kill box."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In his presentation, Brauchler emphasized how Holmes deliberately planned the attack to compensate for failures in his graduate school studies and in his romantic life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The prosecutor also mentioned hours of video testimony with a psychiatrist during which Holmes describes taking aim at fleeing movie patrons to increase the image of his self-worth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"He knows what society thinks about what his conduct will be," Brauchler said, making one of the key points the prosecution hopes will persuade jurors to reject the defense contention that Holmes was overcome by psychosis and could not distinguish right from wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It is the question of sanity and what Holmes did or did not know that night that will be the key issues for jurors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Closing arguments were slightly delayed Tuesday as the defense questioned some of the wording on slides the prosecution was going to use in its presentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. ordered Brauchler to change or delete some of the material, saying the wording misstated the evidence or made overbroad allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Holmes, now 27, is charged with 24 counts of murder and 140 counts of attempted murder - two counts for each person killed and two for each person injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He is also facing a weapons charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Holmes has entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, meaning that he acknowledges he was the gunman but believes he wasn't legally responsible because he couldn't tell right from wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>If he is found not guilty by reason of insanity, he would be committed indefinitely to the state mental hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>If he is convicted, jurors will then decide the penalty: life in prison without parole or execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>It took nearly three more months to choose the jury after 9,000 summonses were sent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The trial began with opening statements April 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Jurors heard from more than 250 witnesses, viewed more than 24 hours of video and saw more than 1,500 photos, including images of the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>They also examined scores of pieces of evidence, including Holmes' guns and ammunition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Holmes didn't testify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The crucial evidence is expected to be the testimony from psychiatrists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>All agree that Holmes was mentally ill, but two court-appointed psychiatrists testified Holmes was legally sane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Two defense psychiatrists told jurors he was legally insane.</td></tr>
