<h3>Bali nine death sentence judges 'asked for bribes' for a lighter sentence: new claim</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The sensational allegation is contained in a letter sent by the legal team of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to Indonesia's judicial committee, claiming there had been a breach of ethics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The letter says the judges received pressure from "certain parties" to hand out the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The lawyers, led by human rights advocate Todung Mulya Lubis, told the judicial committee that all six judges who brought down the death sentence had breached ethics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The new claim follows the shock intervention of the Bali nine's former legal counsel, Muhammad Rifan, last weekend, who said there had been an "intervention" that could discredit him but provided no details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In an extraordinary statement after visiting the men inside Kerobokan prison, Mr Rifan said he was prepared to "take the heat" and provide the "never revealed evidence" to Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's current lawyer, Mr Mulya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's something that implicates us, it could discredit me. But for them I will take it. I told Myuran it's okay," Mr Rifan said cryptically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's one last thing I can do for them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Following his dramatic, if imprecise, comments, Mr Rifan left Indonesia to travel to Mecca for a religious pilgrimage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The lawyers, meanwhile, have also written to Indonesia's Attorney-General, H.M Prasetyo, requesting a stay of execution for Chan and Sukumaran, who are due to be executed this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They say their clients have an outstanding legal challenge in the administrative court and there is still a chance for their clients to have their sentence commuted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The letter to the judicial committee is the third appeal this year by the pair's lawyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A bid for a second judicial review foundered after it was found it contained no new evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A case lodged with the administrative court in Jakarta is pending, although Mr Prasetyo has already requested that it be dismissed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Prasetyo's conduct has raised questions about the independence of Indonesia's judiciary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran have been facing imminent execution for several weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On Monday, Australian embassy officials will attend a meeting in Jakarta with the Indonesian government to discuss the arrangements for the killing by firing squad.</td></tr>

<h3>Pupils pay tribute at Oisin funeral</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>His organs were donated to save five lives after he died in hospital on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>School friends formed a guard of honour as the remains were carried into St Patrick's Catholic Church in the rural western fringe of the county on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Oisin's last primary school report said: "I have no doubt he has a very bright future ahead of him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fr Seamus Quinn read out the poignant note during Requiem Mass at Holywell near Belcoo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said Oisin had just decided to become a professional sportsman, having played Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) football for his school and village club while also competing in cross-country running and soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hundreds of classmates lined the route and Oisin's coffin was carried into the church with a GAA jersey on top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Oisin's mother Sharon, father Nigel and younger sisters Ciana and Cairen led mourners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Those who could not get into the packed church watched on a large screen outside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Fellow pupils of the Year 9 student wore GAA jerseys draped over school uniforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Two floral wreaths depicted a football and GAA jersey in tribute to the promising young sportsman's talent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The school choir sang "Together, together, the children of God" as he was brought into the church.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The teenager played Gaelic football in Belcoo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>His mother is secretary for the local club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Fr Quinn said: "Oisin was also gifted with a lovely personality, a great sense of humour, was a natural communicator and always willing to help others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Oisin was a natural, unaffected young lad. He was quiet and easy to be with, with the kind of smile that drew the best out of you, whether you were young or old. While Oisin was a leader, he was not at all an egotist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"He wasn't in love with the position of leader and, in fact, Oisin would always take time and make place for people who might not have found it as easy to achieve as he did himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"He had the ability to found friendships with those who didn't share his own passions and interests. He was a people person."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The priest said the grief of his young classmates from St Michael's, and fellow team mates from sport say more than any adult could ever get across.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Indeed Liam Magee, the principal of St Columban's the local primary school, remarked to his parents when Oisin was leaving that 'he could almost run the school' such was his helpful manner and personality in his time there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Oisin was buried in the adjoining cemetery.</td></tr>
