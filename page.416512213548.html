<h3>Bali Nine execution U-turn urged</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan would be a grave injustice say their brothers, who have pleaded for Indonesia's president to call off the firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After spending some of his final hours with his brother, Chinthu Sukumaran said his brother's last wish was to paint for as long as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"He's found peace with what may happen but he and we all feel that this is a grave injustice and it did not have to be this way and it still doesn't have to be this way," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Bali Nine pair was told on Saturday they will be executed as soon as Tuesday, a moment preserved by Sukumaran who signed one of three self-portraits "72 hours just started".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Their lawyer Julian McMahon took a fourth more disturbing self portrait from his cell on Sunday, depicting the artist shot through the heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His mother Raji and sister Brintha also visited on Sunday, making the sad journey with Chan's mother Helen, brother Michael and fiancee Feby Herewila and other friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Sukumaran said they asked Joko Widodo to show the same mercy he'd asked for his own citizens on death row overseas.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Chan said his brother's only wish would be to go to church with his family in his last days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The two boys are still holding up pretty well considering they feel this is injust (unjust) to what has happened over the last ten years with their whole case," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Somewhere in the legal system for Indonesia there's got to be mercy and the president needs to show that now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"He's the only one that can stop it and it's not too late to do so."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It's reported only nine of the 10 prisoners Indonesia had readied for execution will face the firing squad, with Frenchman Serge Atlaoui granted a reprieve.</td></tr>
