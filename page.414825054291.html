<h3>EU softens up to Zimbabwe?s Mugabe with aid resumption</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It is the first time the EU is providing financial aid to Zimbabwe since sanctions were imposed in 2002 as a result of human rights abuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 234 million euros ($270 million) aid package which was signed on Monday (16.02.2014) will be used to fund what the EU said were three key sectors; health, agriculture and governance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Phillip van Damme, the EU ambassador to Zimbabwe, present during the signing ceremony compared their bilateral relationship to that of a husband and wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"In the past, we may not always have been on agreement on the way forward to achieve our common objectives," van Damme said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"In a true partnership among equals, we may sometimes diverge in opinion and vision. But those divergences can be overcome through real, frank and open dialogue without taboos. It's like in a marriage."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The European Union stopped providing aid to Zimbabwe in 2002 following reports of human rights abuses committed by President Robert Mugabe's government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Vincent Musewe, a Zimbabwean political and economic analyst, told DW that the EU's resumption of aid to Zimbabwe was most likely a result of pressure from President Mugabe's ZANU-PF regime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We continue to question the thinking behind the EU, if you look at the socio-economic conditions on the ground, ZANU-PF is not doing anything," Musewe said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>According to Musewe, the ruling ZANU-PF is more concerned about internal battles that are going on within the party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are all very distraught that these people [ZANU-PF government] did not have an economic plan for Zimbabwe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Musewe said he welcomes the aid package but doubts if it will change the "economic front".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Did the EU get it wrong?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The development funds would be channeled through UN agencies such as UNICEF and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Previously, assistance to Zimbabwe had been confined to ease the country's humanitarian crisis which has been going on for over a decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In November 2014, the EU said conditions in Zimbabwe had improved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This paved the way for the lifting of the so-called "restrictive measures".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Zimbabwean analyst Musewe believes the EU got it wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"For two years now, we have a new constitution but ZANU-PF has done nothing to ensure that the laws are aligned to the constitution," Musewe added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said there was also an increase in corruption as the economic conditions worsen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"The Europeans are not at the same page as we are," said Musewe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>President Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace Mugabe remain on the travel ban to all EU member states in what the bloc refers to as "targeted sanctions".</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>During Monday's signing ceremony, Zimbabwe's Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa pleaded with Brussels to change its stance on the nearly 91-year old leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"For as long as sanctions remain, dialogue will unnecessarily remain contentious and might retard progress towards normalization of relations," Chinamasa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The European Union is saying to us: 'Ministers and others you can visit us but do not bring your father'. That is not how relations should be conducted," Chinamasa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I am calling for the lifting of sanctions against the president and our first lady so that we can seriously engage in dialogue that will lead to full normalization of relations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It remains to be seen if Chinamasa's appeal will receive a positive response when EU officials meet over the issue later this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>For Musewe, Zimbabwe's government is putting pressure on the EU only for the removal of targeted sanctions on Mugabe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But he says the attitude of the Zimbabwean strongman towards the west is unlikely to change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Fundamentally, I think his personal stance is not likely to change in the near future."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Last year, Mugabe snubbed a special invitation extended to him to attend an EU-Africa summit in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>This was after his wife was denied a visa to accompany him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>EU defended the move saying Grace Mugabe had no business in Belgium since she was not a head of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Never shy of courting controversy, Zimbabwe's first lady, Grace Mugabe, is being linked to the eviction of families from a farm - without any offer of alternative accommodation - in the middle of the rainy season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Zimbabwe now has two new deputy vice presidents, but their powers are limited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>They were appointed by President Robert Mugabe after he had sacked vice president Joice Mujuru and ten ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Zimbabwe's main opposition party MDC-T is about to hold an elective congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Party leader Morgan Tsvangirai, recently the target of an internal, abortive coup, has told DW he will be standing for re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Zimbabwe's parliament has expelled 17 lawmakers who split from the opposition MDC -T party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The move further weakens an already fragmented opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Western nations have asked the Zimbabwean authorities to investigate the disappearance of an activist opposed to President Robert Mugabe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The opposition MDC claim the police have closed their headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Robert Mugabe has been the president of Zimbabwe since its independence from Britain in 1980.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>His 91st birthday was feted at a lavish party near the Victoria Falls, accompanied by criticism at home and from abroad.</td></tr>
