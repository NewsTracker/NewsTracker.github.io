<h3>New Mexico nuclear enrichment plant OK'd for expansion</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Hobbs News-Sun reports (http://goo.gl/je1FF0) that the panel gave the OK last week on URENCO's most recent license amendment application.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That means URENCO can double its capacity over the course of two more phases beyond the current three-phase $4 billion facility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It also means the company can store more raw and depleted uranium on site and can re-feed uranium tails left over after the enrichment process back through their centrifuges to recover more enriched uranium for nuclear fuel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The facility now has approval to double its productive capacity.</td></tr>
