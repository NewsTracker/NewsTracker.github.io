<h3>Ricciardo deserved F1 penalty: Raikkonen</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>One of Daniel Ricciardo's Formula One opponents believes the Australian should have been penalised for the cheeky move he made to grab fifth place in the Monaco Grand Prix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ricciardo utilised his fresh tyres on Sunday to make a late and ambitious bid for the podium, diving down the inside of Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen to pip the Finn in the closing stages of the race won by German Nico Rosberg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When Raikkonen tried to defend his position, Ricciardo's front wheel made contact with the Ferrari's rear, sending him wide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The stewards decided not to take action over the incident, but Raikkonen said he thought the 25-year-old Red Bull driver should have been penalised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's not very clear what you are allowed to do because sometimes you get a penalty for gaining advantage and other times you don't," Raikkonen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There is usually a penalty for this kind of thing but this time there was not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"In my mind it was pretty obvious, but the stewards think different."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ricciardo, who qualified fourth, had pointed to Monaco as his best shot at a first podium finish following a lacklustre start to the F1 season dogged by engine troubles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Australian hasn't managed a result better than sixth in 2015, having finished sixth at the Australian Grand Prix in March and again in Bahrain in April, before placing seventh earlier this month in Spain.</td></tr>
