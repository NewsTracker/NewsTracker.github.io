<h3>'American Idol'-like talent competition app called 'Chosen' launches on Apple devices</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The talent competition app "Chosen" from David Hyman, the former CEO of Beats Music, is launching Thursday for invitees on Apple devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We designed 'Chosen' for tastemakers, up-and-coming talent and the more than 1 billion fans of online music videos, traditional reality competition TV shows and mobile gaming," said Hyman in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In the app's "karaoke" and "lip sync" modes, performers can show off their range from a selection of 75 different tunes, while the "perform now" mode allows entertainers of any kind to showcase any skills, from hip-hop dancing to violin playing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The uploaded performances can be voted on by fellow users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The winner will be announced in June and be given a chance to perform on stage at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hyman hopes "Chosen" isn't like other star searches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"On 'Chosen,' fans and performers are able to get in the game in a way that simply isn't possible while passively watching TV shows like 'American Idol' and 'The Voice,' endlessly surfing online videos," said Hyman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"In addition to being a powerful performance platform, 'Chosen' is a completely new way for fans to interact and engage with music and video content."</td></tr>
