<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta forward Thabo Sefolosha will miss the Hawks' final four regular-season games and the postseason because of a fractured right fibula and ligament damage suffered when he and teammate Pero Antic were arrested early Wednesday in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Hawks confirmed Sefolosha's injury Thursday and said he will need surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Swiss player was limping following the arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''This is a very difficult situation for Thabo and our thoughts and support will be with him during his recovery,'' Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''We know that his approach and dedication will serve him well in his rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sefolosha's attorney, Alex Spiro, said Wednesday the forward was injured during the arrest, which followed the stabbings of Indiana Pacers forward Chris Copeland, his girlfriend and another woman on the street near a Manhattan nightclub.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sefolosha and Antic were released without bail after they were charged with obstructing governmental authority and disorderly conduct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Spiro said the two did not commit a crime and he expects the charges to be dismissed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Hawks held out Sefolosha and Antic in Wednesday night's 114-111 win at the Brooklyn Nets and haven't said when Antic will return.</td></tr>
