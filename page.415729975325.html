<tr><td>2</td><td>Hundreds of civilians, including many children, have been abducted and are being used as human shields by Boko Haram extremists, a top Nigerian official confirmed Wednesday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>He said he could not specify how many were taken captive but local reports say as many as 500 people were seized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When troops from Chad and Niger advanced toward Damasak, Boko Haram began taking captives, said Omeri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Boko Haram rushed to primary schools they took children and adults that they are using as shields to protect themselves from the menacing advance of troops," said Omeri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They are being used as shields by Boko Haram."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Damasak, near the border with Niger, was recaptured from Boko Haram on March 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The mass abduction happened as the extremists were fleeing the advancing troops and information about the seizures of civilians has only been confirmed now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The soldiers who recaptured Damasak found the town largely deserted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Damasak had been held for months by Boko Haram, who used the trading town as an administrative centre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The troops from Chad and Niger who now hold Damasak have discovered evidence of a mass grave, Chad's ambassador to the UN, Mahamat Zene Cherif, confirmed Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>International assistance is needed for the thousands of Nigerian refugees who have fled the violence, said the head of the UN refugee agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Some 74,000 Nigerians have fled to neighbouring Cameroon, according to the agency.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>The UN agency says the Nigerian crisis is one of the most underfunded in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In February, the agency asked for $71-million to assist displaced people in Nigeria and neighbouring countries; already that figure appears to be too low, it said this week.</td></tr>
