<h3>Thousands wait for relief in Vanuatu as death toll inches up</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australian and French troops arrived on the South Pacific nation's hard-hit island of Tanna, where shaken residents were waiting for help after their villages were flattened by Cyclone Pam's 270-kilometer- (168-mile) per-hour winds last Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, citing figures from Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office, upgraded the number of confirmed deaths to 13 from 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Among the dead were seven people from Tafea Province, which includes Tanna, and six from Shefa Province, which includes the main island of Efate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Still, given the immense power of the storm, the relatively low death toll is a testament to the residents' experience in dealing with cyclones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In many villages, people found shelter in special structures built with sturdy walls that can withstand heavy winds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Vanuatu's government authorized the distribution of emergency food and water supplies to affected areas, and was working on a complete damage assessment report before beginning a wider distribution of relief items.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Some relief supplies have been starting to get there anyway, but the more organized and the larger relief efforts will start tomorrow," said Osnat Lubrani, the U.N.'s Humanitarian Coordinator for Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The relief has to start coming now, because if it doesn't come in the next two days or so, then we will have problems with food and with water."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Aerial surveys of the islands continued Friday, with a New Zealand air force plane flying over Vanuatu's northern islands to survey the damage and check on potential water sources for survivors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On board was Cliff Luke, a Vanuatu government representative and resident of Epi Island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He grew emotional as he looked down at the battered remains of the island he calls home, where he said there is no running water and people were drinking muddy creek water to survive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Vanuatu is a nation of subsistence farmers, dependent on the food they grow for their own survival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The cyclone wiped out gardens, killed livestock and contaminated the water supply in many areas, and agricultural experts estimate that those displaced by the storm will run out of food in less than a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Vanuatu government needs at least $2 million in financial aid to buy supplies and ship them to the worst-hit islands, the U.N. said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The government was asking for donations of enough biscuits, rice and canned protein to help keep islanders' fed through June, when newly planted crops will be ready.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A barge carrying food, water and shelter materials arrived on Tanna on Friday and the supplies were being taken to the island's main hospital, said Tom Perry, spokesman for CARE Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Two assessment teams were also planning to reach remote sections of the island on Friday that were reported to have been decimated, he said.</td></tr>
