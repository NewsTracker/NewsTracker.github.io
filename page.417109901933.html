<h3>Google?s YouTube Kids App Criticized for ?Inappropriate Content?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google's YouTube Kids app is shown in the company's Google Play app store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Child and consumer advocacy groups complained to the Federal Trade Commission Tuesday that Google's new YouTube Kids app contains "inappropriate content," including explicit sexual language and jokes about pedophilia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Google launched the app for young children in February, saying the available videos were "narrowed down to content appropriate for kids."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, in a Tuesday letter to the FTC, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and the Center for Digital Democracy said they found videos that would be "extremely disturbing and/or potentially harmful for young children to view."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They asked the FTC to investigate whether Google's marketing is deceptive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Examples of what the non-profit groups found include: explicit sexual language in cartoons; jokes about pedophilia and drug use; activities such as juggling knives, tasting battery acid, and making a noose; and adult discussions about family violence, pornography, and child suicide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The groups sent a video Tuesday to the FTC documenting some of what they described as "inappropriate content" found through the search function on the YouTube Kids app on May 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Google promised parents that YouTube Kids would deliver appropriate content for children, but it has failed to fulfill its promise," Aaron Mackey, an attorney representing the groups, said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In Apple's App Store, the YouTube Kids app is described as "Made for Ages 5 and Under."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It has more than 1,000 ratings that average four out of five stars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>However, a recent one-star review said the app needed more filters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The reviewer said the app suggested videos to a four-year-old that contained kids using "foul language" and making toys to stab other children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Last month, a larger group of child advocacy groups, including the two signing Tuesday's letter, complained that the app mixed programming and advertisements, with branded videos from companies including McDonald's , Mattel and Hasbro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They asked the FTC to investigate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>An FTC spokesman said the agency had received the complaints and was reviewing them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said the agency's investigations are private so he could not confirm or deny whether it was investigating the YouTube Kids app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We work to make the videos in YouTube Kids as family-friendly as possible and take feedback very seriously," a Google spokeswoman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She declined to comment on whether the FTC had contacted Google or YouTube about the app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Content for the app is picked using a combination of automatic filters, user feedback and manual reviews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The spokeswoman said users can flag videos they consider inappropriate; Google will review the video manually and remove it if it doesn't belong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"While we work hard to get it right, it's nearly impossible to have 100% accuracy," Google said in the support section of a website for the YouTube Kids app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Parents that want to limit content more in the app can switch off the search function, the spokeswoman added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>This prevents any potentially inappropriate content showing up in search results and it also means kids won't see any recommended or related content while they are watching videos in the app.</td></tr>
