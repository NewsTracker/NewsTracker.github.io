<h3>Putin, Lukashenka Discuss Russia-Belarus Union State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The formation of the Union State in 1996 has resulted in several pacts aimed at creating greater social, political, and economic integration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But plans for a single currency faltered long ago, in part because of Lukashenka's concerns about ceding too much power over his country to Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Putin said the Union State was "no substitute for the common market and common economic space set up among Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Russia" in a grouping now called the Eurasian Economic Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But he said "we have our own issues and tasks that we are tackling within the Union State, and to that extent this union is even somewhat more advanced."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Lukashenka praised Belarus-Russia cooperation and a peace deal for the conflict in Ukraine that was reached at talks in his country's capital, Minsk, on February 12.</td></tr>
