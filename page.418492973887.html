<h3>Nintendo CEO who broadened video game appeal dies of cancer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TOKYO (Reuters) - Nintendo Co Ltd (7974.T) Chief Executive Satoru Iwata died of cancer on Saturday, months after he led the Japanese video-game maker's belated entry into mobile gaming following years of declining sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was 55.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The death of the hands-on CEO and president, announced by Nintendo on Monday, comes at a critical time for the company which is betting that its new smartphone tie-up with online game maker DeNA will help make up for declining console sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Iwata long resisted investors' calls to move into mobile games for fear of cannibalizing Nintendo's traditional console base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He announced the move in March as stiff competition from console rivals and mobile games continued to drag on sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company did not announce a replacement but Genyo Takeda, senior managing director and one of the lead developers of Nintendo's Wii console, will lead the committee for Iwata's funeral - a sign he could be taking on the leadership role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They say it's not yet decided who the next CEO will be, so there's a slight uncertainty," Japan Asia Securities deputy general manager Mitsuo Shimizu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This comes just as we saw a glimmer of hope for the company."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nintendo has forecast it would double annual operating profit in the year through March thanks to the DeNA tie-up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Despite some concerns over succession, Kyoto-based Nintendo's shares rose 1.49 percent, in line with the broader Tokyo market (.TOPX).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Deutsche Bank analyst Hanjoon Kim maintained a "buy" rating on the shares and said Takeda and other long-serving board members would likely ensure stability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Takatoshi Itoshima, chief portfolio manager at Commons Asset Management, said the main task for the next CEO would be to carry out Iwata's smartphone project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The next goal for the management is to carry this on," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Takeda and fellow senior managing director Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of the Mario and Donkey Kong hit games, will be the sole remaining representative directors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Iwata had surgery in June last year to remove a growth in his bile duct and had returned to work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He attended an annual shareholders' meeting on June 26, but his condition suddenly deteriorated in the last few days, Nintendo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Iwata's main legacy was broadening the appeal of video games with the bestselling Wii, which included fitness titles and fantasy battles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Gaming fans took to Twitter to mourn his death, and even rival Sony Corp's PlayStation account said: "Thank you for everything, Mr. Iwata."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Iwata, who became president in 2002 at the relatively young age of 42, was the first CEO from outside the founding Yamauchi family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Hooked on computer programming in high school, Iwata told developers he was a "gamer at heart".</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In his later years, though, he came under pressure from investors amid competition from Sony and Microsoft (MSFT.O) and a shift in casual gamers to smartphones.</td></tr>
