<tr><td>3</td><td>Pasco police said he threw multiple rocks, hitting two officers, and refused to put down other stones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>PASCO, Wash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>(AP) - Officers killed a man accused of hurling rocks in the fourth fatal police shooting since last summer, a death that is shaking this agricultural city of 68,000 in southeastern Washington and drawing criticism from as far away as Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The killing Tuesday of orchard worker Antonio Zambrano-Montes sparked protests after witnesses said he was running away when he was shot in a busy intersection in Pasco, a city about 215 miles southeast of Seattle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mexico's Foreign Relations Department on Thursday condemned the shooting of the man raised in that country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said he was monitoring the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Franklin County Coroner Dan Blasdel, whose office was conducting an autopsy on Zambrano-Montes, said he was considering convening an inquest jury to look into the death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We don't want another Ferguson here in Pasco," Blasdel told The Seattle Times, referring to the unrest that followed the Aug. 9 killing of an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Missouri, and a grand jury's decision not to indict the white officer who shot him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But the coroner says he won't decide until the investigation wraps up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This was really not a racial issue," Pasco Police Chief Bob Metzger told KING-TV of Seattle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The chief met for two hours with Zambrano-Montes' relatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Three police officers against one man throwing a rock?" an aunt, Angela Zambrano, said to The Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"This was murder in cold blood."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Police say Zambrano-Montes' threatening behavior led officers to open fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The 35-year-old threw multiple rocks, hitting two officers, and refused to put down other stones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They say a stun gun failed to subdue him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He had a run-in with Pasco police early last year, having been arrested for assault after throwing objects at officers and trying to grab an officer's pistol, court records show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The shooting launched protests, and demonstrators say they will gather again Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Meanwhile, a handful of people showed up at Pasco City Hall on Thursday to support police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It's important for these officers to know the entire community is not out to get them," Chris Black, an Army veteran, told the Tri-City Herald.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The police chief has appealed for patience during an investigation and an internal review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The officers are ... on administrative leave - until they are reviewed and everything is done, they will not be back to work," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"It's important we get the right information."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Some people who saw the shooting videotaped the confrontation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In one recording, five "pops" are audible shortly after the video begins, and the man can be seen running away, across a street and down a sidewalk, pursued by three officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>As the officers draw closer to the running man, he stops, turns around and faces them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Multiple "pops" are heard and the man falls to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In three previous fatal police shootings in Pasco, prosecutors cleared officers with the Pasco Police Department and a sheriff's deputy who was working on a regional SWAT team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Zambrano-Montes was raised in Michoacan, Mexico, and has lived for about a decade in Pasco, where more than half the residents are Hispanic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In its statement, Mexico's Foreign Relations Department called the shooting one of the "events in which unwarranted use has been made of lethal force."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The department said it was helping Zambrano-Montes' family "with the aim of ensuring that all available legal avenues are explored and taken to their fullest extent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Family members told the Tri-City Herald that Zambrano-Montes battled depression after being separated from his two teen daughters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"He was a kind person, family-oriented," his cousin, Blanca Zambrano, told the newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"He was hard-working."</td></tr>

<h3>Fighting rages in run-up to Ukraine ceasefire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A ceasefire is due to come into effect from Sunday under the agreement, which also envisages a withdrawal of the heavy weapons responsible for many of the 5,000 casualties in the conflict that broke out almost a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kiev said pro-Russian rebels had built up their forces across separatist-held zones since the deal and both sides accused each other of killing civilians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Two people were killed and six wounded when a shell hit a cafe in the Kiev-controlled town of Shchastya near rebel-held Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, a local official said, adding that other shells had struck elsewhere in the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The town's heating system is broken, power lines are damaged as well as the water supply ... So this is how a comprehensive ceasefire is prepared for," the head of the Kiev-controlled administration, Hennadiy Moskal, said online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The rebels accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the separatist stronghold of Donetsk and the town of Horlivka, where they said on their website that three children had been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The sound of artillery could be heard in the outskirts of Donetsk and clouds of black smoke hung over its suburbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Outgoing fire from the Ukrainian side was visible on the road between Kiev-controlled Kramatorsk and rebel-held Donetsk and rebels at a checkpoint near Donetsk said they had been hit by mortar strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They mocked the impending truce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"What sort of ceasefire? Don't make me laugh. This is already the second or third ceasefire," one said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The deal, sealed by the leaders of Germany and France on Friday after 16 hours of all-night talks in Minsk, capital of Belarus, with the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, was soon overshadowed by the clashes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A Ukrainian military spokesman said 11 soldiers had been killed and 40 wounded in the past 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The enemy continues to build up forces in the main areas of the armed conflict," Andriy Lysenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Fighting was intense around Debaltseve, a railway junction linking the two main rebel areas, where separatists used rockets and artillery to attack government forces holding the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Rebels are repeatedly storming the strongholds and base camp of Ukrainian forces," in and around Debaltseve as well as firing artillery, mortars and rockets, Lysenko said, stressing that government troops had held their positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The United States and Europe have threatened further sanctions against Moscow if the rebels seize more territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ukraine's pro-Western president said he was not naive and wanted to make clear the country was a long way from peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Nobody has a strong belief that the peace conditions which were signed in Minsk will be implemented strictly," Petro Poroshenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Away from the battlefield, disagreements surfaced over whether a rebel amnesty or the release of a Ukrainian pilot detained by Russia were part of the ceasefire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Western diplomats said the European Union would go ahead on Monday with already planned sanctions against 19 Ukrainian separatists and Russians, despite the ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>NATO and the United States said the fighting ran counter to the spirit, if not the letter of the agreement and U.S. officials said further sanctions were still on the table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>At an EU summit in Brussels, the leaders of Germany, France and the European Council also said new sanctions were possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>On Friday, the Kremlin said the four leaders remained in touch over the Ukraine crisis, and that he expected a phone conversation in the coming days, RIA news agency reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said Moscow expected all points of the deal to be implemented, but that Russia had not promised to free detained Ukrainian pilot Nadezhda Savchenko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Savchenko's case would be decided by a Russian court, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Ukraine, for its part, said it had not agreed to an amnesty for all rebels, drawing an angry response from the separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Sanctions by the EU and United States have piled intense economic pressure on Russia's economy, which has also been hit by a collapse in oil prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Russia's economy minister said he hoped sanctions would be lifted soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the agreement with Russia on Ukraine as a good start but said undertakings must now be respected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Ukraine reported a new, mass influx of Russian armour into rebel-held eastern Ukraine as the agreement was being finalised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The deal calls for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line when and if the ceasefire has taken hold, and constitutional reform to give eastern Ukraine more autonomy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The rebels have advanced far past an earlier ceasefire deal, agreed in September, and the new agreement appears to envisage them pulling their guns back around 75 km, to take them back behind it, while Ukrainian guns would move 25 km back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>This would leave a buffer zone 50 km wide, a challenge for the monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who are expected to patrol it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It also appears to take more territory outside Kiev's control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The White House, under pressure from Congress to provide arms to the stretched Ukrainian military, said the deal was "potentially significant" but urged Russia to withdraw soldiers and equipment, and give Ukraine back control over its border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Russia denies arming the rebels and sending troops to fight alongside them, despite what Ukraine and its Western allies say is overwhelming evidence.</td></tr>
