<h3>Sierra Leone schools reopen after long closure due to Ebola</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The authorities have waived fees at state schools and hope 1.8 million children will return to catch up on a lost academic year in the impoverished country of 6 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"This marks a major step in the normalisation of life in Sierra Leone," said Roeland Monasch, representative for the U.N. Children's Fund in Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Unicef has supplied schools with soap and water and thermometers to check for fever, an Ebola symptom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Few children returned to school in the capital Freetown but the trickle would likely grow in the days ahead, according to Leslie Scott, national director for aid agency World Vision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The scepticism is based on fear of Ebola because people are not very confident of sending their children if schools are not well prepared," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ebola has killed more than 10,500 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia since the epidemic began in December 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The number of new cases has dropped dramatically but health workers say it is vital to avoid complacency if the epidemic is to be eradicated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In Sierra Leone, new weekly cases fell to just 9 in the week to 5 April, down from more than 500 at the peak in December, data from the World Health Organization showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At the Prince of Wales secondary school in the west of the city, hundreds of pupils showed up in a compound that medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres used as an Ebola care centre just a few weeks previously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The compound has been decontaminated but classrooms are still being prepared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Some of the kids are standing here (in the sun) because their classrooms are still being painted," said school principal Rodney Coker, who said the turnout was impressive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>By contrast, Emmanuel Caulker, principal of the Jaiama Secondary School in Kono district in Sierra Leone's east said only 13 children showed up, compared to an expected 500, a turnout echoed by other schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have also not received our teaching and learning materials promised by the government," he told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Unicef and World Vision said they had trained teachers to support children bereaved by the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In all, more than 9,000 children were orphaned by Ebola in Sierra Leone, some of whom survived the disease themselves.</td></tr>
