<h3>Emails reveal WHO delayed declaring Ebola emergency due to political considerations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Foreign workers were being evacuated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Top disease-fighters warned that the virus could soon spread across West Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the World Health Organization resisted sounding the alarm until August, partly for political reasons, despite the fact that senior staff in Africa proposed doing so in June, The Associated Press has found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The two-month delay, some argue, may have cost lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>More than 10,000 are believed to have been killed by the virus since WHO first announced the outbreak a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>WHO has acknowledged acting too slowly to control the Ebola epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In its defense, the agency says the virus's spread was unprecedented and blames several factors, including lack of resources and intelligence from the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Internal documents obtained by AP, however, show WHO's top leaders were informed of how dire the situation was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But they held off on declaring an emergency in part because it could have angered the countries involved, interfered with their mining interests or restricted the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Declaring an emergency was "a last resort," Dr. Sylvie Briand, who runs WHO's pandemic and epidemic diseases department, said in a June 5 email to a colleague who floated the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It may be more efficient to use other diplomatic means for now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Five days after Briand's email, WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan was sent a memo that warned cases might soon appear in Mali, Ivory Coast and Guinea Bissau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But it went on to say that declaring an international emergency or even convening a committee to discuss it "could be seen as a hostile act."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Critics and former WHO staff dismiss that reasoning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"That's like saying you don't want to call the fire department because you're afraid the trucks will create a disturbance," said Michael Osterholm, a prominent infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The signs this was no ordinary outbreak -- the panic, the health workers' deaths, and the urban spread of the virus -- were there from the beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Many are recorded in a memo sent to WHO's Africa director on March 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In mid-April, an experienced Ebola expert with WHO's Africa office wrote to Geneva, with disturbing news that many staffers at a leading hospital in Guinea had been exposed to the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"What we see is the tip of an iceberg," Jean-Bosco Ndihokubwayo wrote in an email, writing in all caps: "WE NEED SUPPORT."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Ebola outbreak erupted at a difficult time for the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>WHO was also struggling to contain polio outbreaks -- which it had declared an international emergency in May -- and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>At a June 2 meeting, one senior scientist warned the agency was "overwhelmed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Declaring an international emergency might not necessarily have fixed all those problems -- some argue it can create new ones -- but it acts as a global distress signal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Dr. Joanne Liu, the international president of Doctors Without Borders, said she had been lobbying Chan to sound the alarm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"You have the legitimacy and the authority to label it an emergency," Liu said she told Chan in a July 30 meeting in Geneva.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"You need to step up to the plate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The emergency was eventually declared on August 8, by which point nearly 1,000 people had already died from Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>WHO's Ebola response leader, Dr. Bruce Aylward, couldn't say whether an earlier declaration would have made a difference, noting that "the overall response slowed down" after the emergency was declared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Had we declared it earlier, it is very, very difficult to say how perceptions would have affected the response."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Dr. Matthieu Kamwa, a former WHO scientist, describes that kind of reasoning as contradictory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>If emergencies don't work, why declare them at all?</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The declaration triggered a global deployment to contain the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>U.S. President Barack Obama ordered up to 3,000 troops to West Africa and promised to build more than a dozen 100-bed field hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Britain and France also pledged to build Ebola clinics; China sent a 59-person lab team and Cuba sent more than 400 health workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Kamwa says it's clear the alarm should have been sounded sooner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"People died because things were not done," he said.</td></tr>

<h3>Exclusive: Japan tax agency, Hong Kong join FBI in reviewing Universal casino payments - sources</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The review is part of a wider audit of the company's books, the people said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Separately, the payments are also a focus of a previously undisclosed criminal investigation by Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption, sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The ICAC has become involved because the transfers under review passed through bank accounts based in Hong Kong, those people said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Wednesday, Universal said in a statement that its U.S.-based subsidiary, Aruze USA, had received a subpoena from a grand jury in the United States that it believed was related to "suspicion" of bribery related to the payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company did not say when that subpoena had been received or where that federal grand jury was seated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Universal said it believed it would not face charges in the United States "as long as a fair and proper investigation is conducted."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The statement by Universal was the first time the company had acknowledged a subpoena or confirmed the existence of a grand jury as part of the federal investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The FBI has been investigating whether payments that originated in a bank account held by Aruze USA that were made in 2010 to Rodolfo Soriano, an associate of the then-head of the Philippine gaming regulator, constituted a violation of U.S. anti-bribery laws, according to people with knowledge of the probe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At the time of the payments, Universal was seeking tax and other concessions related to a casino it is building on Manila Bay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The National Bureau of Investigation in the Philippines investigated the case as potential bribery but said it was suspending that probe because it did not have access to witnesses in Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Soriano did not respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Lewis Tam, a spokesman for Hong Kong's ICAC, said the agency "would not comment on individual cases."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The FBI declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A spokesman for Japan's National Tax Agency said it was policy to not comment on specific cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Universal had no immediate comment beyond its statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In recent months, the FBI has continued to gather evidence and interview witnesses, sources have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The FBI investigation has been underway since 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In addition to the bribery question, the FBI has been examining whether an offered payout to a former Universal employee in Japan to stop cooperating with its investigation constituted obstruction of justice or witness tampering, people with knowledge of the matter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The offer of a payment was made in July 2013 by a lawyer for Universal to a former Universal employee if he retracted claims and stopped cooperating with investigators, according to records reviewed by Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Japanese tax authorities began examining Universal's accounting in 2014 and went this week to the company's headquarters near Tokyo Bay, sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The scope of the tax agency's audit was not clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The agency has the power to bring criminal cases if it determines there is evidence of wrongdoing, but it has not indicated that the review of Universal has moved from an audit to a more formal investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Universal has blamed the transfers on the unauthorized actions of former employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The company convened an outside panel of experts which found that while there was no evidence of bribery, the payments pointed to governance problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Universal restated its accounting for the payments twice in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Universal has said that $10 million was improperly accounted for as payment for a bad loan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The company has yet to determine how the remaining $30 million was used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The developments came as Mississippi's gaming regulator on Thursday renewed the license held by Universal's founder and controlling investor, billionaire Kazuo Okada, to sell slot machines in the state, saying it based its decision on its own investigation and not on press reports about the allegations of bribery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Mississippi Gaming Commission voted to approve the "suitability" status of Okada, whose license had come up for a nine-year review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The commission also approved the license of Aruze Gaming America, Okada's slot machine subsidiary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>It did, though, add a new clause to Okada's gaming license that would trigger a review for possible revocation in case the probes by the FBI and others are not resolved satisfactorily, the commission's executive director Allen Godfrey told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The hearing was the first public appearance in the U.S. by Okada since the FBI launched its probe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Reuters and Japan's Asahi newspaper are among the media outlets that have reported on the FBI's investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"You may have some doubts as to what I've been doing because of the reports in the press, including Reuters and Asahi Shimbun," Okada said through an interpreter before the commission made its ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"These are all misunderstandings. They portray me as if I'm a bad person but that's not the case."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Okada has sued Reuters for defamation based on that reporting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>A Reuters spokeswoman said the company stands behind its reporting.</td></tr>
