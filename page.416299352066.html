<h3>Corey Perry blasts Ducks past Jets 4-2 in playoff opener (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Corey Perry nudged the puck over the Winnipeg goal line and raised both arms in celebration of a tiebreaking score, only nobody believed him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The referees told him to play on, the crowd didn't roar and his fellow Anaheim Ducks couldn't stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The hockey world should know better than to doubt Perry in matters of goal-scoring by now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Winnipeg Jets won't doubt the Ducks' ability to get out of any trouble in their already chippy playoff series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Perry scored two goals in the third period of a four-point performance, and the Ducks rallied from another late deficit for a 4-2 victory over Winnipeg on Thursday night in their first-round series opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Perry scored the tiebreaker with 6:39 to play, but the officials didn't immediately see that the puck had crossed the line near Ondrej Pavelec's outstretched pad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The teams played on for 62 seconds until a stoppage allowed video review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''I had a good feeling,'' Perry said with just a note of sarcasm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The tape confirmed another impressive third-period rally by the Ducks, who had 24 comeback wins in the regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fans at Honda Center who could see replays began to roar before the ruling, and the good news rippled through the arena until it was official.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Game 2 is Saturday night at Honda Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Captain Ryan Getzlaf and Sami Vatanen each had a goal and two assists, while Frederik Andersen made 25 saves for the Pacific Division champions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Perry also tied it with his 23rd career playoff goal on a power play early in the third period, ending Anaheim's seven-game power-play drought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Vatanen scored the Ducks' opening goal, and Getzlaf added another power-play goal with 3:05 to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''We don't quit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That's basically it,'' Andersen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Rookie Adam Lowry and Drew Stafford scored for the Jets in their first postseason game since the Atlanta Thrashers moved to Canada four years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Pavelec stopped 29 shots in his NHL playoff debut for a franchise that hadn't been in the postseason since 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A team located in Winnipeg hadn't made the playoffs since 1996, months before that franchise became the Coyotes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Jets' relative postseason inexperience only showed slightly, but it was enough to cost them against the playoff-toughened Ducks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''That's a team with a lot of experience in the playoffs, but I think we kind of gave it to them with all the penalties,'' Pavelec said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>With Teemu Selanne watching from a luxury suite, the Finnish Flash's first and last NHL teams got their first playoff series off to a bad-tempered start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The clubs played their opener at a fierce tempo, delivering brutal checks and moving the puck aggressively on almost every shift.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Both teams have ample motivation going into the postseason, with the Ducks eager to shake their underachieving reputation and the Jets determined to excel in their debuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Less than two minutes after the Ducks took the ice in front of a frenzied Orange County crowd waving orange towels, Vatanen put them ahead with his first career playoff goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But 49 seconds later, the 22-year-old Lowry scored in his playoff debut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Stafford put the Jets ahead early in the second period with a quick shot on an odd-man rush.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Anaheim was awful in the second period for much of its otherwise successful season, and the trend continued in the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But after Winnipeg missed on numerous scoring chances, the Ducks finally pushed back late in the period and finally earned their first power play when Mark Scheifele overreacted after a whistle - and Perry capitalized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''We give their skill guys that extra time and space ... and they'll make you pay for it,'' Stafford said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''I felt as though we could have had this one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The hard hits culminated in a prolonged scrum after the final horn, with Winnipeg's Blake Wheeler attempting to fight Anaheim's Clayton Stoner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>NOTES: The Jets scratched injured C Mathieu Perreault, who missed the season finale with a lower-body injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Perreault revitalized his career with Anaheim last season before signing with Winnipeg as a free agent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>... The Ducks scratched injured center Nate Thompson and three healthy late-season acquisitions: James Wisniewski, Jiri Sekac and Tomas Fleischmann.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Rookie Chris Wagner made his playoff debut in his 10th NHL game overall.</td></tr>
