<h3>Liberia lifts Ebola curfew and re-opens borders</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The West African nation and its neighbours Guinea and Sierra Leone have seen new infections drop to a tenth of the numbers being reported at the September-October peak of the outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Liberia, which recorded the most deaths and was hardest hit, is leading the recovery, reporting just a handful of new confirmed cases each week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has ordered the lifting of the curfew imposed nationwide. It takes effect beginning Sunday, February 22," a statement from the presidency said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"She has also ordered the re-opening of all the country's main borders that were ordered closed during the Ebola outbreak."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The presidency said "health protocols" would prevent the importation of the virus through any of the re-opened crossing points to Guinea and Sierra Leone, which were closed last year as part of a state of emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Almost 9,500 people have died in the outbreak, although health authorities have admitted that the real picture could be far worse, as many fatal cases may not have been reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The World Bank said in January the economic damage of the epidemic could run to $8 billion, trimming an earlier estimate of $32 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The curfew announcement came as the United States said Ms Sirleaf would visit the White House on February 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She will meet US president Barack Obama to discuss the Ebola response and the gruelling task of economic recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"President Sirleaf's visit comes at a time of critical cooperation between the United States and Liberia," Mr Obama's office said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The leaders of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone vowed at a summit in Guinea to eradicate the virus by mid-April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Medical aid agency Doctors without Borders has closed its Ebola clinic at the former epicentre of the outbreak in Sierra Leone, in a further symbol of the retreat of the epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The charity, known by its French initials MSF, opened the treatment unit in Kailahun when the impoverished eastern district and neighbouring Kenema were being overwhelmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ebola has killed almost 3,500 Sierra Leoneans since it was first reported in Kailahun in May last year, the first case being a traditional healer whose funeral led to the infections of 14 women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The healer's burial was in Koindu, a diamond-mining town in Kailahun across the border from southern Guinea, where the outbreak began in December 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>An investigation later found she had been treating Guinean victims of a mysterious illness that turned out to be Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The epidemic exploded in Kailahun and Kenema after her funeral, eventually spreading throughout the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Sierra Leone has seen a cumulative total of more than 11,000 cases during the epidemic but no new cases have been reported in Kailahun for more than two months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The focus of the response in Sierra Leone is now its western area including the capital Freetown, where the outbreak has yet to be brought under control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The country placed 700 homes in Freetown in quarantine last week following the death of a fisherman who tested positive for Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Transmission remains "widespread" in Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organisation, which reported 74 new confirmed cases in the week to February 15, down from 76 the week before.</td></tr>
