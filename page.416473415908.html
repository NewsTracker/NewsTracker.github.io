<h3>After brawl, Royals beat White Sox 3-2 in 13 innings (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CHICAGO (AP) -- The Kansas City Royals stayed in their fighting mood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They also stayed in their winning mood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A benches-clearing fight led to five ejections several innings before Eric Hosmer hit the go-ahead double in the 13th to lead the Royals to a 3-2 win over the Chicago White Sox on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With two outs, Hosmer's hit off Chicago's Jake Petricka (0-1) brought in Jarrod Dyson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Wade Davis then pitched a scoreless 13th for his fourth save, giving Franklin Morales (2-0) the victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That gave Kansas City a win for the fourth time in five games, during a night that tempers flared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''With two or three scrums going on you're always worried about somebody getting hurt,'' Royals manager Ned Yost said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''I found myself at the bottom of one of those piles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He got to the bottom of a pile after what looked like a routine play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In the seventh, Yordano Ventura snagged a grounder from Chicago outfielder Adam Eaton and they appeared to exchange words before Ventura threw to first to end the inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Eaton had to be restrained from Ventura, who was ejected from a second straight start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Players from both dugouts and bullpens ran onto the field and punches were thrown during a fight that lasted a couple of minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''It was a messy situation,'' Ventura said through a translator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Chicago pitcher Jeff Samardzija was one of five ejected, and his actions didn't gain the Royals' approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''For me, I'm not a big fan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I'm not a big fan of him,'' said Lorenzo Cain, who was tossed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The play was the culmination of tensions that seemed to rise during the game and carry over from their season-opening series earlier this month when the teams combined to hit six batters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In the bottom of the fourth, Ventura hit Jose Abreu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In the top of the fifth, Chris Sale hit Mike Moustakas.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>''This game's emotional and it seems to follow them around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It's happened often enough,'' Chicago manager Robin Ventura said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>For Yordano Ventura, it was his fourth consecutive start that ended abruptly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Besides the ejections, on opening day against the White Sox he left with a thumb cramp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He was replaced April 12 against the Los Angeles Angels because of a right calf cramp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Kansas City has been in a fighting mood for a week now, something Chicago knows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''They've earned everything they've gotten and now they want to keep it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>You don't expect anything less,'' Eaton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''With the other beef with other teams, I'm not sure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In that three-game series against Oakland last weekend, the Royals and A's cleared their benches each day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Nearly as many people were hit by pitches as hit home runs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>And five players and coaches were ultimately thrown out of the finale Sunday, when things boiled over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Yost doesn't want what happened Thursday to carry over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Before the fight, Ventura pitched seven innings and allowed two runs while striking out eight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Sale only gave up two first-inning runs and lasted seven innings and allowed nine hits.</td></tr>

<tr><td>45</td><td>Royals LHP Danny Duffy (1-0, 5.51) faces White Sox LHP Jose Quintana (1-1, 8.40).</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Duffy is 1-1 with a 3.72 ERA at U.S. Cellular Field, while Quintana is 0-6 with a 4.66 ERA in 13 starts against Kansas City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Unlike the Royals' season-opening sweep of the White Sox, Chicago had Sale and Petricka available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Robin Ventura said ''you want everything you got'' when facing the Royals, who entered Thursday having won three of four.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>''You just always want to feel complete when you're competing with somebody as good as these guys,'' Ventura said.</td></tr>
