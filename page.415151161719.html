<h3>Iraq sends 30,000 troops in bid to retake city from ISIS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The operation in the birthplace of former dictator Saddam Hussein was announced last night by Iraq's prime minister, who urged soldiers and government-backed Shiite militias to spare civilians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Speaking from Samarra, the other main city in Salaheddin province, Haider al-Abadi appeared to be addressing fears of reprisals against the Tikrit area's mainly Sunni population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On social media, Mr Abadi called 'for utmost care in protecting civilian lives and property' in the city, which was last year the scene of a brutal massacre of hundreds of mainly Shiite Iraqi army recruits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Government forces have been working their way north in recent months, notching up key victories against IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But Tikrit, which has resisted them several times, is their toughest target yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'Security forces are advancing on three main fronts towards Tikrit, Ad-Dawr (to the south) and Al-Alam (to the north),' a senior army officer on the ground told AFP by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The army officer said the forces involved in the battle were from the army, police, counter-terrorism units, a government-controlled volunteer group known as the Popular Mobilisation units and local Sunni tribes opposed to IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'The attack is being carried out using fighter jets, helicopters and artillery targeting Tikrit to secure the advance and cut supply routes,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Military sources said Iraqi warplanes were involved but it was not immediately clear whether foreign air support - Iranian or from the US-led coalition fighting IS - was also called in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>According to both Iraqi and Iranian media, Qassem Suleimani - supremo of the elite Iranian Quds force, specialising in 'subversive warfare' - was in Salaheddin province to help coordinate operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tikrit would be the biggest victory yet for Iraqi forces battling Islamic State, but the attack by thousands of Shiite irregulars could severely test the government's ability to handle sectarian divisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Iraq is bitterly split between minority Sunnis, who were an important base of support for Saddam Hussein, despite his regime's nominal secularism, and the Shiite majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Since the Islamic State insurgency began, the Iraqi military is heavily dependent on Shiite militias that have been accused of abusing Sunni communities elsewhere in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'The priority we gave to the armed forces and all the forces taking part alongside them is to preserve the security of citizens,' Mr Abadi said last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Speicher is a military base near Tikrit from which hundreds of new, mostly Shiite, recruits were kidnapped before being executed last summer, as the Islamic State insurgency took control of much of Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Shiite militias in particular have vowed to avenge the Speicher executions, sparking fears of mass killings against Sunnis if Tikrit were to be recaptured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Abadi appealed to residents to turn against the jihadists, who have suffered a string of military losses since a U.S.-led coalition of Western and Arab nations stepped up their support for Iraq's embattled government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>'I call on all those who were misled and made mistakes in the past to lay down their arms today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>This may be the last chance,' Mr Abadi said, suggesting some could be granted amnesty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Iraqi forces tried and failed several times to wrest back Tikrit, a Sunni Arab city on the Tigris river around 100 miles north of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The military commander for Salaheddin province, Abdel Wahab Saadi, said Tikrit had both symbolic and strategic importance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>'The aim of course is to liberate Salaheddin to allow for the return of displaced families but it is also going to be a stepping stone on the way to liberating Mosul,' he told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Tikrit is the hometown of executed dictator Saddam Hussein, the remnants of whose Baath party have collaborated with IS in attempting to topple the Shiite-dominated government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>IS declared a 'caliphate' last June straddling Iraq and Syria, where the US-led coalition has also been conducting air strikes but not coordinating with any significant ground force.</td></tr>
