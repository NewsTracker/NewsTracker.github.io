<h3>Apple will replace AT&T in the Dow Jones industrial average</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP)?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple is in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>AT&T is out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In another milestone for the popular and profitable iPhone giant, Apple will replace AT&T in the venerable Dow Jones industrial average on March 19, the manager of the index announced Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The move isn't likely to impact the 30-stock index much, and will have no effect on the fortunes of the two companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But market experts say it does have symbolic importance, sort of like getting an Oscar at the Academy Awards?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>or at least a nomination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The change cements Apple as "the gold standard of technology," says Daniel Ives, a financial analyst at FBR Research.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They've really become the modern-day Wright Brothers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The reshuffling of the 119-year-old Dow, a barometer of market fortune and folly once dominated by railroads, also reflects a changed business world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It underscores that technology continues to be a critical driver of the overall economy," says Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple is the world's most valuable company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Its market value on the stock exchange, or what it would take to buy all its shares, closed last month above $700 billion, a first for any company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Apple won't get top billing in the Dow, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Thanks to a quirk in the way the index is calculated, that honor will go to a company a little over a tenth as valuable: Goldman Sachs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Dow weights companies by how much it costs to buy a single share, not all of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On Friday, a Goldman share fetched $186.91 versus $126.60 for Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>For all the symbolic importance, the trigger for the move is less colorful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The manager of the index, the S&P Dow Jones Indices, said it's making the change in response to a planned stock split for Visa, another Dow member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After its four-to-one split, Visa will wind up with a lower price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>S&P said that would reduce the weight of the information technology sector in the Dow because Visa, a credit-card and payment-processing giant, counts as a tech stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Adding Apple will help balance out this reduction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>S&P Dow Jones Indices said the decision to fold in Apple won't alter the overall level of the index, which stood at 17,856 Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>S&P Dow Jones is casting the move as a sort of a housekeeping maneuver, a way to ensure that the index better reflects the U.S. economy and markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The switch is not a reflection of its view of Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"This doesn't mean we like the stock, or don't like the stock, or something like that," says David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>While the Dow change wasn't triggered by anything AT&T did, it comes at a challenging time for the phone giant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Its stock has risen just 3.5 percent in the past 12 months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>That compares with a 10.4 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Apple, meanwhile, has jumped 67 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>To keep growing, AT&T has had to look beyond cellphones?</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>to tablets and connected cars, for example.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Adding a tablet to a phone plan gets AT&T another $10 in monthly service fees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Dallas-based company is also trying to wean customers off equipment subsidies and shift them toward installment plans in which they ultimately pay full price for a phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In its most recent quarter, AT&T booked a loss due to one-time expenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But its revenue rose 4 percent as it added 1.9 million subscribers, double the year-ago quarterly increase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>AT&T has bounced in and out of the blue chip average over the Dow's long history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It first entered in 1916 as American Telephone & Telegraph, joining Central Leather, Studebaker and other industrial giants in an elite club of 20 companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Much later, in 2004, AT&T was kicked out only to return the following year when it merged with SBC Communications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Created in 1896, the Dow is one of the oldest gauges of stocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Grover Cleveland was U.S. president that year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Companies like the Pacific Mail Steamship were counted among its ranks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The index tracks only 30 stocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The Standard & Poor's 500 reflects the moves of 500.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The S&P 500 also ranks companies differently, assigning weights based on the value of all a company's shares, not just one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>That gives Apple more influence on daily moves in the index than any other stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>It accounts for nearly 4 percent of the index.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Professional investors focus more on the S&P 500 because they think it reflects the stock market better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>They tend to use that index, not the Dow, to judge the performance of their own portfolios.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Ordinary investors also prefer the S&P 500, judging from the money they've put into index funds that mimic its performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Investors have $4 trillion in 1,261 funds that track the S&P 500, according to Morningstar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>That compares with just $13.6 billion in 12 Dow-based index funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Still, the Dow can't be dismissed as a relic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>It continues to be much cited and isn't seen as wildly distorted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>One reason is that, for all its flaws, the Dow has largely mirrored the ups and downs of the much larger S&P 500.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>In the past 12 months, for instance, the Dow has risen 8.7 percent versus the S&P 500's 10.4 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The last big Dow shake-up came in September 2013, when Goldman Sachs, Nike and Visa knocked out Alcoa, Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard.</td></tr>
