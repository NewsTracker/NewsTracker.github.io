<h3>Greek PM says initial deal in bailout talks 'very close'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece's prime minister voiced hope that bailout talks between the cash-strapped country and its international creditors are "very close" to an initial deal, and ruled out early elections if the dragging negotiations fail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Alexis Tsipras told private Star TV that he believes a first agreement can be struck by the end of next week, which can then be ratified by Greece's European partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I think that by the 9th of May we will have an agreement" that will allow release of some bailout funds, he said in a three-hour interview screened just before midnight Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Since its election in January, Tsipras' radical left-led government has been locked in increasingly fraught talks with other European countries that use the euro currency - which provide the bulk of the bailout cash that has kept Greece afloat for five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At stake is a final 7.2 billion-euro ($7.8 billion) rescue loan installment, which will enable the country to keep up payments to its European creditors and the International Monetary Fund - as well as to state employees and pensioners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greece's cash reserves are perilously low, and failure to meet its obligations could potentially trigger a chain of events eventually forcing the country to abandon the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A major test would be on May 12, when Athens has to pay the IMF about 700 million euros ($757 million).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tsipras said that if the government has to choose, "our priority is our responsibility towards society, it is (paying) pensions and salaries."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Creditors are demanding further reforms and savings, and have encountered strong opposition from Tsipras' government that was elected on promises to alleviate five years of income cuts and fiscal pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tsipras ruled out early elections if the talks fail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But, while insisting he expects an agreement, he did not exclude holding a referendum on the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"If I end up having an agreement that puts me outside the limits (of my mandate), I will have no other resort," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The people will decide - obviously without elections, I want to make that clear."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Earlier Monday, Greece reshuffled its bailout negotiating team following fierce criticism of its flamboyant finance minister, meeting with market applause as investors hoped it will facilitate a deal to save the country from bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Tsipras insisted that Yanis Varoufakis, who has come under fire from his European peers for dragging his feet in the bailout talks, continued to enjoy the government's support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He will continue to lead the negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But Euclid Tsakalotos, who is minister of international financial relations and part of the foreign ministry, will handle the coordination within Varoufakis' negotiating team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tsakalotos is close to Tsipras and has often accompanied Varoufakis on trips to European capitals during the negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The moves suggest Athens is intent on reaching a deal and the main Greek stock index rallied on the news, closing up 4.4 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Yields on the country's two-year bonds - a gauge of market fears that the country might default - fell almost 2 percentage points to about 23 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Varoufakis was rebuked by Greece's creditors most recently at a finance ministers' meeting in Riga, Latvia, where he failed to come up with a list of economic reforms creditors are demanding.</td></tr>
