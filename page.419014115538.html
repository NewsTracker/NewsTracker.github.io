<h3>Sepp Blatter leaving International Olympic Committee</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sepp Blatter is leaving the International Olympic Committee after 16 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA president Sepp Blatter's term as an International Olympic Committee member ended Monday when he did not seek re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blatter was among a group of IOC members up for re-election for another eight-year term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But IOC President Thomas Bach said Blatter informed him by letter on July 23 that he would not stand again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Blatter, beset by a corruption scandal at FIFA, is due to be replaced as FIFA president in an election on Feb. 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"He does not deem it to be appropriate to stand for re-election for eight years knowing that after seven months his term would come to an end," Bach said on the final day of the IOC's general assembly in Kuala Lumpur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Blatter, an IOC member since 1999, would have had to retire from his IOC term next year anyway because he turns 80 in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The IOC confirmed that Blatter's membership ended on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Elsewhere, 14 other IOC members were re-elected for eight-year terms, while Gunilla Lindberg of Sweden was re-elected to another four-year term on the IOC's executive board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Two new members were elected Monday to the IOC: Nenad Lalovic of Serbia, head of wrestling's world governing body, and Diagna Ndiaye, president of Senegal's national Olympic committee.</td></tr>
