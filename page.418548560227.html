<h3>Ian McKellen at Holmes with his Sherlock</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>You would think Sir Ian McKellen would be eager to conquer any iconic role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After all, the 76-year-old portrayed Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies interweaving those performances with Magneto in the X-Men superhero pictures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Still, redefining Sherlock Holmes in Mr. Holmes gave the classically trained thespian pause until he was assured old friend Bill Condon would be directing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"If it hadn't been the script it was and it hadn't been Bill (Condon) directing I think I would have thought, 'So surely we have trampled over poor Sherlock enough'," says McKellen from his home base in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This is a different sort of story. And when you've played Hamlet and Macbeth and King Lear, Sherlock Holmes doesn't seem too frightening."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>McKellen's Holmes is also a sleuth with a difference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He is a 20th-century Sherlock, a feeble soul remembering an unsolved case involving a mysterious woman who ultimately prompts the famous detective to retire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The movie, which time shifts, takes us on a journey of intrigue that includes humour, drama and some sadness as the past informs the present with a lasting impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As usual, McKellen is effortless in his portrayal of the deductive genius who reveals his flaws while sequestered in a country home with his housekeeper (Laura Linney) and her young son (Milo Parker).</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Typically, the actor deflects his poised portrait to praise Condon who directed McKellen to a best actor Oscar nomination for his role in 1998's Gods and Monsters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He's a very diligent director," says McKellen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He prepares everything so carefully, every nook of the film from casting to the script. And he pushes you into whatever you are doing on the day to get the best job done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The extra effort required from the actor also arrived with his two main Sherlock portrayals - the decrepit Sherlock and the more lively version recalled in flashbacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It helps that the makeup was so good and I was wearing quite a lot of makeup for both Sherlock roles," McKellen reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It was the same with Gandalf. Once you get the makeup right, and you look in the mirror, the DNA, being what it is, expands that through the rest of your body."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>All things considered, McKellen's Sherlock tends to be more tolerant than usual as he unravels a personal puzzle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Solving the mystery is always part of the fun in a Sherlock movie but I think he turns out to be more humane and more of human being with problems that we all have," says the actor who describes his character with enthusiasm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>When McKellen's told he seems to exude a young person's zeal for the acting craft, he quickly agrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I love being an actor," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It doesn't seem to be an extraordinary job to me. It actually helps me in life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"As a young gay man growing up, I did escape life through the theatre. Now I've reconciled the two and I am still enjoying it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>That doesn't mean he's above calling in favours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>For instance, he pleaded with Condon for a role in his live action version of Beauty and the Beast currently shooting in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I got on my knees and said, 'Bill, please let me be in Beauty and the Beast'," says McKellen who voices the talking clock Cogsworth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mr. Holmes opens July 17 in Toronto and Vancouver, and July 24 in Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa.</td></tr>
