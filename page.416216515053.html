<h3>Officials react after concerns over Islamic law nix proposal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The opponents were concerned that passing the legislation could have forced the state to uphold child support rulings made in other countries under Islamic law - a contention others said was baseless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Health officials said Monday that without a revision they stand to lose access to programs that process child support payments and track down scofflaws in addition to $46 million in federal payouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The conflict started last week after a House committee narrowly rejected a bill that had sailed through the Senate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The vote came after state Sen. Sheryl Nuxoll, a Cottonwood Republican, testified that federal regulations incorporated an international agreement regarding child support payments that would subject the state to Sharia law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>None of the nearly 80 countries involved in the treaty - the Hague Convention on International Recovery of Child Support and Family Maintenance, which the U.S. entered in 2007 - is under Sharia law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Nuxoll and other skeptics said some involved nations informally recognize Sharia courts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They added that Idaho wouldn't have the authority to challenge another nation's judgment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The state's Attorney General's Office told the committee, however, that the bill allowed judges to reject cases that don't meet the state's standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Luke Malek, a Coeur d'Alene Republican, meanwhile, called the debate an example of "heavy-handed opportunistic theatrics at the expense of single-parents and children."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He and others said the opponents don't represent Idaho's GOP caucus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Still, in a vote that highlighted the conservative streak in Idaho's Republican-controlled Statehouse, where lawmakers frequently balk at federal mandates, the Rules Committee voted 9-8 to nix the compliance bill, and the legislative session adjourned hours later, throwing the funding and programs into question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Since the issue affects the state budget, legislators could be called into a special session to revisit the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The governor's office released a statement Monday, saying officials were "analyzing the impacts of the committee's actions and what they mean for the 400,000 people who depend on Idaho's system."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Gov. Butch Otter and Attorney General Lawrence Wasden both are Republicans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Idaho Health and Welfare Department officials plan to meet with U.S. Health and Human Services representatives this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They expect to have 60 days to find a solution from that point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"This is a new experience for Idaho," the department said in a statement Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We have been told the federal support for Idaho's Child Support Program will end if Idaho is not in compliance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Without federal tools, parents who are owed child-support payments will have no means to receive them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Idaho uses federal programs to process child support payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>About 80 percent of payments are taken from paychecks, but noncompliance would prevent Idaho from making such collections.</td></tr>
