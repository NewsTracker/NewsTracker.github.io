<h3>Thousands take to the streets for Freddie Gray rally</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Protestors rally at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a march for Freddie Gray, Saturday, April 25, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - Thousands of protesters took to the streets Saturday to demand answers in the case of Freddie Gray, the largest rally since the 25-year-old black man died in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After a few hours of peaceful demonstrations, scores of rowdy protesters crowded outside of Camden Yards, where the Baltimore Orioles were set to play the Boston Red Sox.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One protester threw something at a police car, and kicked the windshield, cracking it, while others threw cans and plastic bottles in the direction of police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At least one protester jumped on a police car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Another car's front windshield was also shattered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>From inside the stadium, fans watched the protesters gather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Before the protest turned tense, demonstrators held signs with slogans such as "Jail Killer Police!" and "Unite Here!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They filled two city blocks and marched 2 miles to City Hall, where the crowd overtook the grassy plaza adjacent from the building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tanya Peacher, a 36-year-old Baltimore resident, said she'd never attended a protest in the city before, but watching a video of Gray's arrest motivated her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Late Friday, Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis said Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested - before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the department's policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gray died April 19 after suffering a fatal spinal injury while in custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Authorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Video showed him being dragged into a police van and police have said he rode in it for about 30 minutes before paramedics were called.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Saturday, residents young and old, from Baltimore and beyond, voiced their anger at how the department and the city's officials are handling the investigation into Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At one point, the crowd paused for a moment of silence in front of Shock Trauma, the hospital where Gray died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The marchers then migrated to Camden Yards, where the Baltimore Orioles are scheduled to play the Boston Red Sox on Saturday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>At a downtown intersection, a dozen marchers laid down in the street during an impromptu "die-in."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Wearing a sign around his neck that said "I am Freddie Gray," 33-year-old Dante Acree joined thousands of others outside City Hall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Acree said he came out to the protest because "it could have been one of my kids."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Leonard Patterson, 56, said he drove from Manassas, Virginia, to be a part of the protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Patterson said he decided to come after thinking about his college-aged daughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I'm trying to do everything in my limbs, everything in my power, to make this a better world for her," said Patterson, holding up his black and white drawing of Freddie Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The drawing shows Gray being hoisted from a police van to heaven by two angels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I'm here to do what I can. Police brutality is as old as the 1950s, the 1960s. It's still here," he said.</td></tr>
