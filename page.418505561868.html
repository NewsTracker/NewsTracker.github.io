<h3>Greinke to start All-Star Game for NL, Keuchel for AL (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CINCINNATI (AP) -- Picked to start the All-Star Game for the National League, Zack Greinke wasn't sure he wanted his wife to make the trek from Los Angeles to Great American Ball Park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>''My wife is less than three weeks until having a kid,'' he said of Emily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''She found a way to get out here even though she probably shouldn't have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A 31-year-old Dodgers right-hander with a big league-best 1.39 ERA, Greinke starts Tuesday night against Houston lefty Dallas Keuchel, known for a distinctive long, bushy beard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Informed Sunday by AL manager Ned Yost that Keuchel was starting, Houston manager A.J. Hinch opted not to tell the first-time All-Star.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Keuchel found out from MLB Senior Vice President Phyllis Merhige when he arrived at the team's hotel on Sunday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''I was able to tell my family, but I couldn't really tell many more,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greinke is 8-2 and enters the game following five straight scoreless starts over 35 2-3 innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The three-time All-Star can terminate his contract at the end of the season, forfeit a minimum $71 million over the next three years and become a free agent again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Given his season, he figures to receive lucrative offers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''These numbers he's putting up are really, really unbelievable,'' NL manager Bruce Bochy said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Keuchel, 27, is 11-4 with a 2.23 ERA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Since starting his big league career 9-18 in 2012 and '13, he is 23-13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He becomes Houston's fourth All-Star starting pitcher after J.R. Richard (1980), Mike Scott (1987) and Roger Clemens (2004).</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The AL will open the game with an all right-handed-hitting lineup for the first time; the only previous team to do that was the NL for the first of two games in 1962.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This is the first time the AL starting lineup did not have at least one player from Boston or the New York Yankees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Bochy said having the decision to have the winning All-Star team's league gain home-field advantage in the World Series has increased the intensity of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Bochy's Giants opened at home in 2010 and '12 and went on to four game sweeps, then started at Kansas City last year and became the first visitor to win a Game 7 since 1979.</td></tr>
