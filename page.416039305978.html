<h3>Hernandez dominant as Mariners beat Angels 4-1 to open 2015 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hernandez (1-0) improved to 6-0 in opening day starts, only two of them at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Taking the mound before a sellout crowd waving yellow ''K'' towels in his honor, he lifted Seattle to its ninth straight win on opening day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mike Trout hit a solo homer in the first inning and Erick Aybar singled leading off the fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That was all the Angels could do against Hernandez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Smith was the offensive star.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Acquired in an offseason trade with San Diego, Smith doubled twice and lined a two-out RBI triple to score Austin Jackson with Seattle's first run of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>All three hits came off Los Angeles starter Jered Weaver (0-1).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Smith became the first player in Mariners history to have three extra-base hits on opening day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Dustin Ackley added a solo home run and Robinson Cano had an RBI single as Seattle's season of high expectations got off to a rousing start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hernandez struck out at least 10 batters for the third time on opening day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He struck out 12 in 2007 against Oakland and 11 last year against the Angels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hernandez is just the fourth pitcher dating to 1914 with at least three opening day starts of 10 or more strikeouts, joining Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez and Bob Gibson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Carson Smith struck out Trout with two runners on to end the eighth and Fernando Rodney pitched an uneventful ninth for his first save.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Trout homered off Hernandez in the opener for the second straight year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Jackson had a chance to rob Trout of the homer, but appeared to mistime his jump at the wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was Trout's third homer off Hernandez and 99th of his career, and the only mistake Hernandez made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He retired nine straight after the home run and allowed only four total base runners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Hernandez got himself into trouble in the fifth giving up a leadoff single to Aybar - the first hit since Trout's homer - and hitting C.J. Cron on the arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But he was out of the jam quickly, striking out Chris Iannetta and getting Johnny Giavotella to hit into a double play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Weaver pitched six innings for the Angels, but it was knocked around in the third and fifth innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He gave up eight hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Angels: RHP Garrett Richards will pitch in extended spring training on Thursday as he continues to recover from a knee injury suffered last August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>... RHP Cory Rasmus is still weeks away from beginning a throwing program after surgery to repair a core injury, manager Mike Scioscia said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mariners: LHP James Paxton starts for Seattle on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Paxton missed a couple of starts during spring training after falling during an agility drill, but said despite the fewer innings he feels ready for the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Angels: C.J. Wilson will start looking for his 16th win against Seattle since 2006.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mariners: Paxton gets the call for Seattle in Game 2, rather than Hisashi Iwakuma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon split his top two right-handers in the rotation with the hard-throwing young lefty.</td></tr>
