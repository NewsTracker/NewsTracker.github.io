<h3>Ferguson judge named in DOJ report resigns</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"I don't believe the report was correct, but it's not worth fighting," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Last week, the Justice Department released a 102-page report that accused local officials of using the police department and the court system as a source of revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A statement issued by Bert Fulk, an attorney at Brockmeyer's firm, defended Brockmeyer's actions and placed much of the blame on the court clerk and the assistant clerks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Unlike the municipal judge, the court clerk is a full-time position and deals with the day-to-day operations of the court. Mr. Brockmeyer appears in the Ferguson Municipal Court only once a week," Fulk said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Mr. Brockmeyer recognizes that the Department of Justice report, as well as recent media reports, regardless of their accuracy or validity, have diminished the public's confidence in the Ferguson Municipal Court."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Judge Roy L. Richter of the Missouri Court of Appeals, Eastern District, was assigned to the St. Louis County circuit court where he'll hear cases from Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His transfer will take effect March 16 and continue indefinitely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As part of Richter's placement, he'll be given the authority to institute new polices in the municipal court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Judge Richter will bring a fresh, disinterested perspective to this court's practices and he is able and willing to implement needed reforms," Chief Justice Mary R. Russell said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The move came less than a week after the Justice Department said the law enforcement and judicial system in Ferguson discriminated against African-Americans.</td></tr>
