<h3>Liberia churches celebrate end of Ebola</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) - Drumbeats echoed across Liberia's capital on Sunday as Christian leaders heeded the president's call to celebrate the eradication of Ebola in the country following a horrific outbreak that claimed more than 4,700 lives in this West African nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At New Covenant Outreach Ministries Incorporated, a fast-growing Pentecostal church in Monrovia, choir leader Ester Tamba led the congregation in a standing ovation to mark 42 days of no Ebola cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That is twice as long as the maximum incubation period for the disease, and means an outbreak is officially over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>For the first time in a year, worshippers were not forced to have their temperatures taken before entering the church.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Yet not everything was back to normal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The traditional round of hugs and handshakes at the end of the Sunday service - which was stopped last year out of fear it could spread Ebola - was not reinstated, and Reverend Venicious Reeves said he was "not in any rush" to resume it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We don't want to discourage the tradition, at the same time we don't want to rush to reintroduce those practices now . So we will keep the hygienic measures in place for now," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf visited health centers on Saturday to praise the efforts of doctors and nurses, and an official government celebration is planned for Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At the same time, officials have warned about new cases of Ebola that continue to be reported in neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
