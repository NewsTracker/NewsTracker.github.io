<h3>When heavyweights like Apple, Microsoft, and Exxon move, the market reacts</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK - At $654 billion, Apple is the stock market's heavyweight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Like a handful of other "big cap" companies such as Microsoft and Exxon Mobil, the iPhone maker's market value means that when its shares move, so can the market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And these are the companies that influence your stock portfolio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The combination of Apple's size and price moves, results in an enormous impact on indices," says Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Lately, Apple's influence has been a drag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Since closing at a record $133 on February 23, Apple has slumped to $115.40, wiping $115 billion off the value of its stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Between then and Wednesday's close, the Standard & Poor's 500, the most widely-tracked stock index, was down 0.5 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Without Apple, the decline would have been a gain of 0.1 percent, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, the company behind the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones industrial average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Of course the opposite is also true, when Apple's shares rise, the market can get a lift.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Either way, for every $1 change in Apple stock, the S&P 500 rises or falls 0.6526 points, says Silverblatt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The impact of the technology giant is so big that S&P Dow Jones Indices has created a technology index that excludes Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That allows investors to separate what's going on with tech stocks from what's going on with Apple because, while they're similar, the two might not be the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For example, the S&P 500 information technology sector is down 1.3 percent since Apple's record close.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Take out Apple and the group has actually gained 1.8 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>History suggests that companies as dominant as Apple don't tend to stay top dog for long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Competitors emerge, new products roll out, and growth can slow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Exxon Mobil, which Apple surpassed to become the biggest publicly-traded company in August 2011, has slumped over the last year along with the price of oil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>To be sure, Exxon Mobil is still big, with a market value, or capitalization, of $322 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But it has slipped to third in the ranking of S&P heavyweights, behind Microsoft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In the early 1980s, computer company IBM was the stock market's big gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Personal computers were still a new concept and IBM was one of the industry's dominant players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>At the end of 1985, the company's stock made up 6.4 percent of the S&P 500's total value, much bigger than Apple's current 3.6 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Since then, the company has had to grapple with fierce competition from more nimble rivals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Like Exxon, Big Blue is still powerful, but it now ranks as the 28th largest in the S&P 500, making up 0.8 percent of the index.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Below are the six biggest companies in the S&P 500, ranked by market capitalization, which is determined by shares outstanding multiplied by stock price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Weight in S&P: 3.6 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Market Value: $380 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Weight in S&P: 2.1 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Weight in S&P: 1.7 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Market Value: $276 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Weight in S&P: 1.5 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Market Value: $261 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Weight in S&P: 1.4 percent.</td></tr>
