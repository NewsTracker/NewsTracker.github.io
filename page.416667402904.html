<h3>Rage to Relief in Baltimore as 6 Officers Charged in Death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Rage turned to relief in Baltimore Friday when the city's top prosecutor charged six police officers with felonies ranging from assault to murder in the death of Freddie Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said Gray's arrest was illegal and unjustified, and that his neck was broken because he was handcuffed, shackled and placed head-first into a police van, where his pleas for medical attention were repeatedly ignored as he bounced around inside the small metal box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The swiftness of her announcement, less than a day after receiving the police department's internal review and official autopsy results, took the city by surprise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>So too did her detailed description, based in part on her office's independent investigation, of the evidence supporting probable cause to charge all six officers with felonies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The police had no reason to stop or chase after Gray, Mosby said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They falsely accused him of having an illegal switchblade when in fact it was a legal pocketknife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The van driver and the other officers failed to strap him down with a seatbelt, a direct violation of department policy, and they ignored Gray's repeated pleas for medical attention, even rerouting the van to pick up another passenger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The officers missed five opportunities to help an injured and falsely imprisoned detainee before he arrived at the police station no longer breathing, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Along the way, "Mr. Gray suffered a severe and critical neck injury as a result of being handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained inside of the BPD wagon," she concluded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Her announcement triggered celebrations across the same West Baltimore streets that were smoldering just four days earlier, when Gray's funeral led to riots and looting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But a lawyer hired by the police union insisted the officers did nothing wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Attorney Michael Davey said Friday that Mosby has committed "an egregious rush to judgment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have grave concerns about the fairness and integrity of the prosecution of our officers," Davey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mosby rejected a police union request to step aside and appoint a special prosecutor to handle the case, and said honorable police officers should have no problem working with prosecutors in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Other law enforcement veterans worried that the charges could have a chilling effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Robert Leight, a former detective in Pennsylvania who has worked for the FBI and as a federal prosecutor and defense attorney, said "the biggest danger is that the police officer will not properly perform his duties."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It puts him at risk, it puts the other officers around him at risk, and it puts the public at risk," Leight said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"A police officer must react instinctively as he has been trained. If a police officer first thinks about what liabilities he will be facing, it's too late."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Gray was stopped by police in Sandtown, a poor, overwhelmingly African-American neighborhood in West Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He locked eyes with a police officer and then ran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Two blocks later, they pinned him to the sidewalk, handcuffed him and dragged him into a transport van, a scene captured on bystander's cellphone video and shown around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mosby said the police review, the autopsy and her own office's investigation all point to homicide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The officers were booked Friday on charges ranging from assault and manslaughter, carrying 10-year prison sentences, to second-degree "depraved heart" murder, which could put the van driver in prison for 30 years if convicted.</td></tr>
