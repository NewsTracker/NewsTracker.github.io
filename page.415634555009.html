<h3>How to balance fantasy bargains with injury risk</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Injuries aren't impossible to predict, but it's a tough study.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>What tends to be a little more difficult for the fantasy player is finding the balance between injury risk and bargain in the draft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While most other owners may be running away from certain players because of an injury, you can be scooping up potential studs at closeout prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Being too cautious could cause you to miss out on a stellar season, but getting too cute could result in a wasted draft pick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There are a number of interesting injured players who fantasy drafters will have to decide on in the next few weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen has been out since early February with a broken foot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The initial diagnosis had the 27-year-old missing up to 12 weeks, signaling a late-April or mid-May return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jansen, who had 44 saves last season, cast aside his crutches this week and began a throwing program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Drafters have not been treating Jansen kindly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Despite a strikeout rate that has been among the tops in the league each of the last three years, Jansen is sporting a FantasyPros.com average draft position (ADP) of 93.7, seeing him last longer on draft boards than Christian Yelich, Evan Gattis, and Hunter Pence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There is probably no player in baseball with a murkier outlook than Masahiro Tanaka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The 26-year-old Yankees starter has a tear in his UCL - a symptom that usually leads to Tommy John surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Tanaka opted for rehab instead of surgery (a route that backfired in spectacular fashion with Jurickson Profar, Yu Darvish and Cliff Lee this spring), and drafters are staying away, generating an 89.5 FantasyPros ADP for the righty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Tanaka's skill and upside normally would have him drafted in the first five rounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Instead, fear over the UCL completely tearing and forcing him to have surgery has kept would-be owners away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Twins super-prospect Miguel Sano is coming back from Tommy John surgery, which is a bit of an oddity for a position player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But his lost 2014 season has drafters with short memories forgetting about Sano's limitless potential.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In 2012 and 2013, he hit a combined 63 home runs and stole 19 bases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Over 379 minor league games, Sano sports a .279 average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He was optioned to minor league camp last week, but his time should come soon in the majors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>While other fantasy owners chase the Kris Bryants and Dalton Pompeys in their keeper leagues, you can sit back and wait on Sano, getting him for a bargain price at the end of most drafts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In other injury news: Nationals outfielder Jayson Werth is sporting a 156.7 ADP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The 35-year-old can hit .290 with 20-plus home runs and has an outside shot of being ready for Opening Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>&Matt Moore (Rays) and Jose Fernandez (Marlins) are on pace to be back on the mound by June-July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Moore is throwing pitches off a mound, while Fernandez just started playing catch at 150 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>&Alex Cobb (Rays) was shut down with forearm tightness early last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It's a scary diagnosis, as it can sometimes lead to Tommy John surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He carries a ton of risk, but an equally high ceiling of potential if he can emerge unscathed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>&Garrett Richards (Angels) had knee surgery in August and looks to be on track for a mid-April return, throwing three innings Wednesday in a spring training appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Richards broke out last year, with a 2.61 ERA, 1.04 WHIP, and 164 strikeouts in 168 2/3 innings pitched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>If the injury didn't interrupt any momentum and he can keep up his high velocity, Richards should be a bargain (132.3 ADP) in fantasy drafts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>For more fantasy analysis from Nando Di Fino and his team, watch the Fantasy Sports Network (FNTSY) on Cablevision Ch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>147. Post readers also can take advantage of a special fantasy baseball draft package offer at fantasysportsnetwork.com/post.</td></tr>
