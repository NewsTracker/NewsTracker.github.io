<h3>Ferguson shooting's witness denied bond-reduction request</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ST. LOUIS (AP) - A key witness in the Michael Brown shooting death has lost his request to have his bond lowered on charges that he resisted arrest during another confrontation with police, keeping him jailed in advance of a court appearance next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>St. Louis Associate Circuit Judge Michael Noble on Monday refused 23-year-old Dorian Johnson's bid to lower the $1,000 cash-only bond set after he was charged last week resisting arrest or interfering with a lawful stop or detention, a misdemeanor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Noble set Johnson's next court appearance for June 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Messages left Wednesday for Johnson's attorneys, Ryan Smith and Daniel Brown, were not immediately returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>FILE - In this Aug. 25, 2014, file photo, Dorian Johnson leaves church at the end of the funeral service for his friend, Michael Brown in St. Louis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Johnson was with Michael Brown when Brown was fatally shot by a Ferguson police officer last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>St. Louis Associate Circuit Judge Michael Noble denied a defense request to reduce the $1,000 cash-only bond for 23-year-old Johnson, Wednesday, May 13, 2015, after he was charged with misdemeanor resisting arrest over a new confrontation with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The St. Louis city prosecutor charged Johnson on Thursday, May 7, 2015, one day after his arrest with two other people by officers trying to disperse a crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Last week's criminal complaint against Johnson accuses him of trying to hinder the May 6 arrest of his younger brother, 21-year-old Demonte Johnson, "by using or threatening the use of violence, physical force or physical interference."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dorian Johnson was a prominent witness to the shooting death in August of Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old who was killed by white Ferguson officer Darren Wilson during a confrontation in a street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Brown's death led to sometimes-violent protests in Ferguson and other U.S. cities, spawning a national "Black Lives Matter" movement seeking changes in how police deal with minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department declined to charge Wilson, who later resigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the Justice Department released a scathing report that cited racial bias and racial profiling in Ferguson policing and in a profit-driven municipal court system that frequently targeted blacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dorian Johnson's arrest came exactly a week after he sued Ferguson, Wilson and the city's former police chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Demonte Johnson, who was charged last Thursday with resisting arrest and a misdemeanor count of assault on a law enforcement officer, was freed Monday after posting $1,000 cash bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>His next court appearance is scheduled for May 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A message seeking comment also was left Wednesday with Demonte Johnson's attorney, John Washington.</td></tr>
