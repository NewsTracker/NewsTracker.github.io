<h3>Walker says he expects to meet with Netanyahu in Israel</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker "absolutely" expects to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his first visit to Israel next month, the Republican said as he prepared to depart for a western European trade mission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The likely presidential candidate told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday that the Netanyahu meeting in mid-May is not yet confirmed, but that it's his "hope and expectation" it will happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A spokeswoman for Walker's political group, Our American Revival, did not immediately confirm Friday whether the meeting has been set up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Walker met with British Prime Minister David Cameron during a trade mission to London in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Walker departs Friday for visits to Germany, France and Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Walker originally planned for his Israel trip to be a taxpayer-funded trade mission, but he determined that was impossible because the "overwhelming majority" of those who wanted to meet with him in Israel had a political interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His political arm is footing the bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Walker said his goal is to meet with Netanyahu and other members of the Israeli government to get an understanding of the issues facing the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Walker has recently hired foreign policy experts to help bolster his credentials, and the Israel trip will be his third trip overseas in four months as he prepares for a likely White House bid.</td></tr>
