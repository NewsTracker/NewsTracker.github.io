<h3>Bali Nine lawyers to aid judicial probe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Indonesian lawyer for Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan will assist a judicial commission probe into claims of bribery and political interference in their sentencing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Australians were executed last week, nine years after they were sentenced to death for trying to smuggle heroin out of Indonesia in the Bali Nine plot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On the day before they were shot, their former lawyer finally detailed claims that judges who sentenced the men asked for more than $130,000 in exchange for giving them a prison term of less than 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Muhammad Rifan says the offer was withdrawn on orders from Jakarta to impose the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The pair's current lawyer, Todung Mulya Lubis, referred the claims to the judicial commission for investigation in February when Mr Rifan first raised them, but only recently received a summons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He will give a statement to the commission on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It is not known when Mr Rifan will be summonsed, or how the executions of Chan and Sukumaran will affect the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The pair had provided affidavits to the judicial commission.</td></tr>
