<tr><td>5</td><td>With nearly all the votes counted, Likud earned 29 out of parliament's 120 seats and should be able to build a coalition government with right-wing and religious allies with relative ease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Exit polls after the voting stations closed late Tuesday showed Netanyahu's Likud virtually tied with Isaac Herzog's center-left Zionist Union, but once the actual results came pouring in early Wednesday, the latter had dropped to just 24 seats.</td></tr>
