<h3>Xbox One, PS4 and PC: FIVE things you need to know about Assassin's Creed: Syndicate</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>UBISOFT has officially unveiled Assassin's Creed: Syndicate, along with new details on the setting and major gameplay changes included in the PS4, Xbox One and PC title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Here's the top five things fans should know about the latest instalment in the AC franchise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Assassin's Creed: Syndicate's release date is October 23 for PS4 and Xbox One, while fans on the PC version have only been given a vague 'Holiday 2015' listing to work with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Pre-order bonuses will include The Darwin and Dickens Conspiracy missions, which will explore inner sanctums of London's most influential men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It has also been revealed that Syndicate is set to divulge from the Unity route and not include multiplayer action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Reasons behind the change is the need for the developers to focus completely on developing the story and game mechanics for a full-blooded single player experience, according to creative director Marc-Alexis Cote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He told Gamespot: "The reason we are doing this is to really focus on the roots of the franchise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"That's why all nine studios are focused on delivering this single-player experience."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It has also been noted that the game's new gameplay focus on penned-in melee combat and vehicle mechanics wouldn't transfer well to the online platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's pretty common for the Assassin's Creed series to uproot fans and move them to a new period and setting but that's not the only thing changing with Syndicate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ubisoft are modernising the game along with its surroundings by doing away with hay bales and bringing new environment options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Distractions will play a greater role, meaning fans will be able to throw thing in fire or cutdown hanging obstacles to get past their enemies, without the need to stick to the shadow and shift shadily past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The city istself will be more accessible, while the added rope launcher is sure to change the way fans get about London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>However, the leap of faith is staying put so don't worry about the complete removal of hay as I'm sure it will still be hanging around in a cart somewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Melee combat is set to be a close quarter affair, with knuckle-dusters being used to dispatch enemy gang leaders in fist-fights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ubisoft have promised that this will be the fastest flowing AC game so far in the series and will include taking on multiple enemies down in the mean alleys of London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Twin siblings Jacob and Evie Frye will be our guides in Victorian London, at a time when the Industrial Revolution is in full swing and the working classes need new heroes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Both will be newcomers to the seven boroughs and will have their own unique story missions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The twins have been trained as Assassins and are looking to change things for the better in 1868.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Cote added: "We are leaving behind the medieval era," he said of the Assassin's Creed series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I think it's a good pace breaker in the line since it allows us to bring a lot of maturity and a lot of freshness to the game play and to the storytelling that we're going to do."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Charles Dickens, I think is someone that our English audience will be very familiar with, as familiar as our French audiences with Napoleon, for example because you were forced to read them probably in school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Charles Darwin well, it goes without saying that his theory has really changed a lot of ways we see our place in humanity's history."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Players will be able to hijack carriages and horses by knocking out the driver, much like in the same way as the GTA series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Fans will have to be careful though, breaking the strict rules of the road will be down the wrath of the local bobbies, while also making sure they don't tip them over or wreck them completely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Carriages can also be used to navigate the city by jumping on top of them, or to hide in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Trains and boats will also play a role in the game, which has yet to be revealed.</td></tr>
