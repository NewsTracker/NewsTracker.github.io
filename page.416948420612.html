<h3>Bulls Taj Gibson ejected in 4th quarter of Game 5 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CLEVELAND (AP) -- Bulls forward Taj Gibson has been ejected from Game 5 in the fourth quarter for kicking Cavaliers guard Matthew Dellavedova.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gibson shoved Dellavedova from behind and then delivered a kick while Cleveland's guard was lying in the foul lane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Players from both teams then exchanged shoves and pushes under the basket before order was restored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The officials reviewed video of the play before referee Joey Crawford tossed Gibson with 10:26 left and Cleveland leading 83-73.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The incident sparked the Cavs, who opened a 92-77 lead with 8:35 left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tensions were running high long before Gibson's kick in the pivotal game as LeBron James and Joakim Noah exchanged words, and the Bulls forward was called for a technical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gibson's ejection was doubly costly for the Bulls, who are again without Pau Gasol because of a strained hamstring.</td></tr>
