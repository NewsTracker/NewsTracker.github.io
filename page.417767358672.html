<h3>FIFA election chief reminds Blatter of need to step down</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sepp Blatter was warned from within FIFA on Sunday not to attempt to backtrack on his pledge to quit as president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Domenico Scala, who is overseeing the presidential election, said that a leadership change is an essential component of the far-reaching reforms required to overhaul FIFA amid deepening criminal investigations into soccer corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Scala's blunt comments came after Swiss newspaper Schweiz am Sonntag, citing unnamed sources, reported that Blatter is considering trying to retain the presidency after receiving support from Africa and Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>FIFA did not comment on the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Blatter announced on June 2 - only four days after being re-elected for a fifth term - that he would stand down from the post after a successor was chosen sometime between December and February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Scala, head of FIFA's audit and compliance committee, is urging Blatter not to consider back-tracking on that pledge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The 79-year-old Blatter has already reneged on a 2011 promise to leave office in 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"For me, the reforms are the central topic," Scala said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"That is why I think it is clearly indispensable to follow through with the initiated process of leadership change as it has been announced."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The FIFA executive committee will meet in Zurich on July 20 to set the election date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Lawmakers from the 28-nation European Parliament last week voted on a resolution calling for Blatter to speed up his announced resignation and let FIFA appoint an interim leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Scala set out the election process at FIFA headquarters on June 2 directly after Blatter's sudden resignation statement and said that significant work was required to "regain the trust of the public," including imposing term limits for the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Blatter has been portraying himself as leading that reform process, via his Twitter account and in FIFA's internal media outlets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>And Blatter used his column in the in-house weekly magazine to praise FIFA's handling of the worst crisis in the organization's 111 years - despite his leading adviser, communications director Walter De Gregorio, abruptly leaving on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The fact that our organization continues to function smoothly and provides football with a firm foundation at this time of crisis makes me all the prouder," Blatter wrote on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Asked on Sunday if Blatter was categorically ruling out standing in the new election, FIFA said: "We refer you to the remarks from FIFA President Blatter from 2 June. FIFA has no further comment."</td></tr>
