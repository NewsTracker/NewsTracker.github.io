<h3>Rookie Mariota struggles early as Falcons top Titans, 31-24 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATLANTA (AP) -- Tennessee rookie quarterback Marcus Mariota, whose first two drives ended with an interception and a fumble, recovered to lead a touchdown drive in the Titans' 31-24 loss to the Atlanta Falcons in a preseason opener Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Atlanta's Matt Ryan completed all six passes for 86 yards on his only possession, including a 13-yard touchdown to Julio Jones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With the assistance of Mariota's early turnovers, the Falcons led 17-0 behind new coach Dan Quinn before the Titans pulled even at 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Michael Ford's 1-yard touchdown run midway through the fourth quarter snapped the tie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mariota, the No.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>Paul Worrilow returned Mariota's fumble 14 yards for a touchdown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The first two possessions provided a painful lesson for Mariota that games are different from practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Early in his first drive, Mariota's short pass was intercepted by linebacker Justin Durant, whose 20-yard return set up a field goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Tennessee's next drive, Mariota was not hit when the ball slipped out of his hand before he could pass.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>He has worked only against the Titans' 3-4 scheme in practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He entered the preseason opener with an impressive streak of 186 passes without an interception in seven-on-seven and team drills at training camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The good news for the Titans was Mariota's recovery on his third possession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He had two 17-yard completions to former Falcons receiver Harry Douglas and a 26-yard pass to running back Antonio Andrews to set up Dexter McCluster's 6-yard scoring run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Backup quarterback Zach Mettenberger also threw an interception late in the first half, but only after he connected with Rico Richardson on a 30-yard touchdown pass.</td></tr>
