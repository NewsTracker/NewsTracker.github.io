<h3>Robert Durst mixed up in story as Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Associated Press accidentally mixed up troubled millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst, 71, and 44-year-old Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The misidentification came rollin' in around 6:30 p.m. local California time Monday in the second paragraph of a story about drug charges filed against Robert Durst in New Orleans, according to the media blog Romenesko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The first line referenced Robert Durst by name, but the second referred to him as "the former Limp Bizkit frontman."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The AP later limped out a correction and told the blog in a statement that the mix-up was in "a brief that appeared solely on the California broadcast wire last night."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Robert Durst is awaiting extradition to Los Angeles to face a murder charge stemming from the 2000 killing of a close female friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His arrest Saturday in the Big Easy came a day before the finale of a shocking, six-part HBO documentary called "The Jinx" in which the oddball suspect appeared to confess he "killed them all, of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He did not kill Susan Berman, and he doesn't know who did," Durst's high-powered lawyer Dick DeGuerin told the Daily News on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Limp Bizkit, an alt-metal band that rose to fame in the mid-1990s with hits like "Nookie" and "Break Stuff," is currently on tour in California.</td></tr>
