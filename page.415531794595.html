<h3>Robert Durst mixed up in story as Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Associated Press accidentally mixed up troubled millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst, 71, and 44-year-old Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The misidentification came rollin' in around 6:30 p.m. local California time Monday in the second paragraph of a story about drug charges filed against Robert Durst in New Orleans, according to the media blog Romenesko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The first line referenced Robert Durst by name, but the second referred to him as "the former Limp Bizkit frontman."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The AP later limped out a correction and told the blog in a statement that the mix-up was in "a brief that appeared solely on the California broadcast wire last night."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Robert Durst is awaiting extradition to Los Angeles to face a murder charge stemming from the 2000 killing of a close female friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His arrest Saturday in the Big Easy came a day before the finale of a shocking, six-part HBO documentary called "The Jinx" in which the oddball suspect appeared to confess he "killed them all, of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He did not kill Susan Berman, and he doesn't know who did," Durst's high-powered lawyer Dick DeGuerin told the Daily News on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Limp Bizkit, an alt-metal band that rose to fame in the mid-1990s with hits like "Nookie" and "Break Stuff," is currently on tour in California.</td></tr>

<h3>Egyptian policeman charged over fatal shooting of peaceful protester Shaimaa Sabbagh</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Images showing a bloodied Shaimaa Sabbagh dying in her husband's arms just after she had been shot were widely shared after the incident on 24 January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ms Sabbagh, 32, was hit by police fire as she marched through Cairo to lay a wreath commemorating Egypt's 2011 revolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Although the decision was a rare one against Egypt's security forces, and came after repeated denials of police responsibility, Ms Sabbagh's friend Iman Shokry told The Independent that the charges are "just for appearances".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They had to sacrifice this officer so we cool down a bit," said Mr Shokry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Azza Matar of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party, of which Ms Shabbagh was a member, said that the wording of the charges is problematic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It says that [the police officer] fired birdshot which hurt her and led to the end of her life - there is no mention of the word 'death', or 'murder'."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ms Matar said the regime gave impunity to the security services and said 13 members of the Socialist Popular Alliance had been charged with violating Egypt's infamous 2013 Protest Law after a recent raid on their Alexandria headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The government has denied the raid took place.</td></tr>
