<tr><td>60</td><td>The documents show how al Qaeda's 9/11 operation unleashed so much force against it, including the CIA drone program, that it had to hide in the shadows and couldn't pull off any successful operation in the West for many years before the death of bin Laden.</td></tr>

<tr><td>82</td><td>The official lamented that drones are "still circling our skies every day" and the only relief from them came when weather conditions worsened and there was cloud cover.</td></tr>

You became part of the battle when you sided with the Americans. If you were to leave us and our affairs alone, we would leave you alone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>The documents show that such a ceasefire was purely tactical rather than the beginning of some kind of rapprochement between al Qaeda and the Pakistanis.</td></tr>

<tr><td>91</td><td>The documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions, and there is no evidence in them that the Pakistanis had any idea that bin Laden was in Pakistan or indeed was even alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>Moreover during the course of reporting the book "Manhunt," about the CIA's long search for bin Laden, I spoke to several senior U.S. officials who said that the U.S. intelligence community was covertly monitoring the communications of Pakistani army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and ISI director Ahmed Shuja Pasha the night of the bin Laden raid and they were both surprised about him being in Abbottabad.</td></tr>

<tr><td>98</td><td>The documents show that al Qaeda's leaders were in contact with Tayeb Agha, a close aide to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>Agha has met with U.S. officials on a number of occasions to discuss peace negotiations.</td></tr>
