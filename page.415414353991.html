<h3>Obama Discusses Ferguson With Jimmy Kimmel</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He said that protesters there had a legitimate right to be angry about their treatment at the hands of the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"What had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and was worthy of protest," Mr. Obama said during an appearance on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"But there was no excuse for criminal acts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr. Obama cited the recent Justice Department report on Ferguson, which he said found a "whole structure" that indicated "both racism and just a disregard for what law enforcement is supposed to do."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But he repeated his belief that what happened in the Missouri city was "not unique, but it's also not the norm."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The president's comments about Ferguson came at a serious moment in an appearance on the late-night comedy show that also included references to Area 51, Hillary Rodham Clinton's email address and the question of whether Mr. Obama goes in search of late-night White House sandwiches in his underwear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>("I could. I don't," he said.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr. Obama helped Mr. Kimmel open the show by participating in a regular feature in which celebrities read mean Twitter posts that people have written about them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One of the posts said, "Is there any way we could fly Obama to some golf course halfway around the world and just leave him there?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr. Obama grinned broadly when he read that one, and added, "I think that's a great idea."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Another post he read said: "How do you make Obama's eyes light up? Shine a flashlight in his ears."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After another post ended with "HaHa! LOL," Mr. Obama tried to channel his inner teenager, saying: "The LOL is redundant when you had the HaHa."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr. Kimmel introduced Mr. Obama as "the first Kenyan-born, Muslim socialist to be elected president," and he prodded him for details about his life inside the iron gates of the White House residence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr. Obama acknowledged that he had not cooked in a long time, and joked that he could not drive as president because "in Kenya we drive on the other side of the street."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Dental problems require only a trip to the White House basement, where Mr. Obama said there was a dentist chair set up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said he had staff members reset the clocks for daylight saving time, though he declined Mr. Kimmel's request to get rid of the time change altogether.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"This is a California thing," the president said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"In the East Coast, you don't mind losing that hour because that's a signal that spring is here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He also declined to say whether he had spent the early part of his presidency digging through the files on Area 51, the military base in Nevada that has long been a source of conspiracy theories about U.F.O.s, for evidence of extraterrestrial life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I can't reveal anything," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>When Mr. Kimmel told him that Bill Clinton had found nothing in the files, Mr. Obama added, "That's what we're instructed to say."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr. Obama briefly turned serious again when he used a question about campaign fund-raising to urge people to turn out to vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>And he briefly mentioned his "Student Aid Bill of Rights" that he announced this week to help students pay back their college loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But most of the appearance was a comedic warm-up to Mr. Kimmel's next guest, the actor Sean Penn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mr. Obama said that he and Mr. Penn talked in the green room before the show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Asked if he had seen Mr. Penn portray the iconic high school stoner in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," Mr. Obama laughed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I lived it," Mr. Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I didn't just see it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on March 13, 2015, on page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: Obama Discusses Ferguson With Kimmel.</td></tr>
