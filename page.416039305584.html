<h3>Encarnacion HR off Tanaka, Blue Jays beat Yankees in opener (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) -- The Toronto Blue Jays gave catcher Russell Martin the second-largest contract in franchise history to help bolster a potent lineup and give the young pitching staff a steady guide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One game into the new season, the deal is looking pretty good for the team with the longest playoff drought in baseball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Martin singled in two runs and Edwin Encarnacion hit a two-run homer off Masahiro Tanaka as the Blue Jays beat the New York Yankees 6-1 Monday in Alex Rodriguez's return to the major leagues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''Martin got it started,'' manager John Gibbons said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Without retired Derek Jeter in the lineup, a restless opening-day crowd at Yankee Stadium reserved one of its only cheers for Rodriguez in his first game back from a year-long drug suspension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Batting seventh, his lowest spot in a regular-season game since he batted eighth in 1996, A-Rod singled, walked, and lined out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''I have to admit, it definitely felt good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That's for sure,'' Rodriguez said after New York's fourth straight opening day loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Drew Hutchison, at 24 the youngest opening-day starter in Blue Jays' history, held the Yankees hitless until Brian McCann laced a ball just inside the first base line for a single with two outs in the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hutchison (1-0) allowed three hits, including Brett Gardner's homer in the sixth inning, to help Toronto improve to 20-19 in openers, including 1-2 vs. the Yankees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''I was extremely excited,'' Hutchison said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Last July, Hutchinson helped the Blue Jays snap another skid against New York: a 17-game losing streak in the Bronx.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Now, he hopes to help Toronto return to the postsesaon for first time since winning the World Series in 1993.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Martin, an ex-Yankee, hit a singled in a five-run third inning against Tanaka (0-1).</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Devon Travis homered later in the game for his first career hit, taking a speedy turn around the bases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Shortly before the Yankees ran onto the field for the first time without a member of the Core Four - Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte and Jorge Posada - on the roster since 1995, the AC/DC song with the lyric ''Are you ready for the good times'' blared over the stadium speakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Those good times didn't last long for New York in its 113th opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>After Tanaka made Toronto look silly with a heavy mix of sliders and splitter for the first two innings, striking out three, the Blue Jays solved him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''We got to him a couple of times because he made mistakes,'' Dalton Pompey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kevin Pillar led off the third with a single and the Japanese star, making his first opening-day start for New York, struggled to get an out after that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Travis walked and Jose Reyes put down a bunt that third baseman Chase Headley threw away, allowing a run to score.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>After Reyes was checked by a trainer at second base, Martin, who signed an $82 million, five-year free-agent contract this winter, singled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>An out later, Encarnacion connected for a 5-0 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Yankees are counting on Tanaka to find the form that made him an All-Star in his rookie season last year before partially tearing a ligament in his right elbow and missing 2 1/2 months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But he lasted only four innings Monday, the shortest opening-day start by a Yankees pitcher since Phil Niekro in 1985, when he went four innings against the Red Sox, according to STATS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A couple of days after saying he expected the velocity on his fastball to be down, Tanaka was right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He was regularly in the mid-90s mph last year, and twice hit 93 this time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''Velocity can be talked about a lot, but we've seen guys throw 95, get hit really hard,'' Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''It comes down to location, movement and deception, which he had the first two innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Blue Jays: Gibbons said one of Reyes' achillies tendons was ''barking.'' He also said the speedy shortstop was fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Yankees: Girardi said he will have to be careful to pick A-Rod's days off to keep him fresh and healthy throughout the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Rodriguez was the DH in the opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>After a day off, the Blue Jays turn to knuckleballer R.A. Dickey, in the final year of a three-year contract with Toronto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Yankees send to the mound Michael Pineda, hoping to remain healthy and have his first full season with New York since arriving in a trade with Seattle in January 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>CC Sabathia moved two locker stalls to the left, into the prime spot occupied by Jeter next to the double-doors at the back of the clubhouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Blue Jays 20-year-old reliever Miguel Castro made his major league debut with two outs in the eighth inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>On his first pitch, a ball, Didi Gregorious was thrown out trying to steal third to end the inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Castro did return for a perfect ninth.</td></tr>
