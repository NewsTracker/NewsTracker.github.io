<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mark Pincus is back as CEO of Zynga, the struggling online game company he founded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He's taking back the reins from Don Mattrick, the former head of Microsoft's Xbox division who took over from Pincus two years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The San Francisco company says Mattrick is out as CEO and as a board member and Zynga employee, effective Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Zynga is best known for games such as "FarmVille" and "Words With Friends."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In its heyday, it was by far the most popular company on Facebook, but lost luster in recent years as people moved on to other games and to mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Now, Zynga bills itself a "mobile-first" company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It says 60 percent of its bookings come from mobile players, up from 27 percent when Mattrick joined in 2013.</td></tr>
