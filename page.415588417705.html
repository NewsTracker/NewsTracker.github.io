<h3>In Netanyahu call, Obama says US reassessing peace approach</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In the telephone call, Obama extended congratulations to Netanyahu for his election victory two days ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But a White House official said Obama also raised Netanyahu's critical comments about Israeli Arabs ahead of the election, which the White House has denounced as a "cynical" effort to mobilize voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private call, because it touched on various delicate subjects between the two leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In a separate statement, the White House said Obama stressed the United States' close security cooperation with Israel, but also emphasized the U.S. commitment to the creation of a Palestinian state existing alongside Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On another divisive topic, the statement said Obama addressed negotiations with Iran over Tehran's nuclear program and said he was focused on a deal that would prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Netanyahu has been a vocal critic of Obama's diplomatic outreach to Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In an interview Thursday with MSNBC, Netanyahu appeared to walk back from his earlier remarks about a rejecting a two-state solution, saying he could support a demilitarized Palestinian state if conditions in the region change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Netanyahu's earlier comment "raises questions about his commitment to a two-state solution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Earnest specifically mentioned that in the past the U.S. has repeatedly cited the goal of creating a Palestinian state when it has intervened on behalf of Israel in the United Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Earnest also criticized anti-Arab rhetoric used by Netanyahu's party in the lead-up to the election as a "cynical election day tactic (that) was a pretty transparent effort to marginalize Arab Israeli votes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Asked whether the subject came up in the phone call, the White House official said, "In his phone call with Prime Minister Netanyahu, the president made the same points in private that the administration has been making in public."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tensions between the White House and Netanyahu escalated as the Israeli elections drew nearer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The White House was especially annoyed when Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Republican House Speaker John Boehner to address Congress earlier this month without consulting the administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Earlier on Thursday, Boehner mocked the Obama administration's chilly reaction to the Israeli prime minister's election victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Asked by a reporter about the administration lukewarm response to Netanyahu's win, Boehner said, "Lukewarm?" and laughed heartily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>White House chief of staff Denis McDonough will give a speech Monday to a major advocacy group that opposes Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>McDonough's address to the J Street group indicates that the administration will seek to strengthen voices that challenge Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>J Street is an Israel advocacy group that often criticizes the Israeli government - and especially Netanyahu.</td></tr>

<h3>US Fed drops &#039;patient&#039; from statement</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Federal Reserve has dropped its pledge to remain "patient" on raising interest rates, signalling a possible midyear Fed funds rate hike after over six years at the zero level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The dropping of the key word from its policy statement on Wednesday at the end of a two-day meeting was a significant step away from its crisis-based monetary policy since 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But a still cautious Fed noted that in fact US economic growth had "moderated somewhat" since January and the central bank marked down its growth forecast for this year by 0.3 percentage points to 2.3-2.7 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy arm, said that although the jobs market appeared to continue to strengthen, inflation was still weak, the housing sector was slow and export growth had slowed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Despite the change in the language, the policy body stressed that it would not rush into a rate hike immediately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The Committee judges that an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate remains unlikely at the April FOMC meeting," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labour market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 per cent objective over the medium term."</td></tr>
