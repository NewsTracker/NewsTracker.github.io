<tr><td>6</td><td>RELATED: Will Donald Trump's campaign survive?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Trump's comments mark a new layer in his continued scrapping on the "blood" comment -- which has roiled even Trump supporters and led to him being disinvited from the past weekend's conservative Red State conference.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>"Blood coming out of her wherever."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He continued to insist Monday that anyone who assumed he was linking Kelly's debate questions to her menstrual period to be sick and said any assertion like that would be "inappropriate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Trump swiped the spotlight at the beginning of last Thursday's debate when he was the only candidate not to rule out a third-party candidacy.</td></tr>
