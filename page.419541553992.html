<h3>IndyCar driver Justin Wilson in coma after wreck at Pocono (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- IndyCar driver Justin Wilson was in a coma and in critical condition after sustaining a head injury when he was hit by a large piece of debris that broke off a car Sunday in the crash-filled race at Pocono Raceway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>IndyCar released the information on Wilson's condition Sunday night and said he was undergoing further evaluation at Lehigh Valley Health Network Cedar Crest Hospital in Allentown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The debris broke off Sage Karam's car when Karam spun into the wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Wilson's car veered left and directly into an interior wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Wilson was swarmed by the safety crew and airlifted by helicopter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''It's just a tough one right now,'' said Michael Andretti, car owner for Wilson and race winner Ryan Hunter-Reay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''Our thoughts and prayers are with Justin right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>We're going to see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>IndyCar had a subdued victory lane and Hunter-Reay was not sprayed with the traditional confetti.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The American said his thoughts were only with Wilson, an extremely popular driver in the paddock who speaks on behalf of his peers regarding safety and competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''All I know is that he was unconscious, he was not responding and he was airlifted,'' Hunter-Reay said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''That's all very bad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The accident was a grim reminder of the dangers of open-wheel racing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon died in 2011 after his car became ensnared in a fiery 15-car pileup, flew over another vehicle and landed in a catch at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Wheldon's head hit a post in the fence, and he died instantly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He was the last fatality in a form of racing that saw drivers Scott Brayton (1996), Tony Renna (2003) and Paul Dana (2006), among others, die after wrecks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Wilson's wife, Julia, was transported to Pennsylvania from their home in Colorado by IndyCar, while his younger brother, Stefan, was lent Tony Stewart's plane to make the trip from Indianapolis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Stewart, the three-time NASCAR champion and former IndyCar champion, is an Indiana native.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The race resumed after the Karam and Wilson accident with seven laps remaining and Hunter-Reay picked his way through the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He passed Juan Pablo Montoya, Takuma Sato and then used a bold inside pass of leader Gabby Chaves to take the lead with five to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Chaves then appeared to have an engine failure that brought out the caution with three to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The race ended under yellow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Hunter-Reay tried to get an update on Wilson before the race resumed, and again before he climbed from his race-winning Honda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''I thought Justin was OK the whole time, and I thought he was in the ambulance with Sage heading off to get a routine check,'' Hunter-Reay said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Josef Newgarden was second and IndyCar points leader Montoya finished third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Graham Rahal, who was second in the standings at the start of the race, was involved in an early crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Montoya's cushion went from nine points to 35 with next Sunday's finale in Sonoma set to decide the title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The finale is worth double points, and six drivers will head to California in contention for the title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Hunter-Reay is mathematically eliminated, but picked up his second win of the season in what's been a disappointing year for Andretti and Honda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Hunter-Reay was one of many who was discussing safety measures -and not his win - for the open-cockpit series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''Maybe in the future we can work toward something that resembles a canopy,'' Hunter-Reay said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''Something that can give us a little bit of protection and still keep the tradition of the sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The 37-year-old Wilson, a native of Sheffield, England, entered this season without a full-time ride.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He latched on with Andretti and was in the sixth of seven scheduled races with the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The deal was put together right before the season-opening race in March and initially started as just a two-race agreement at Indianapolis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Sponsorship was found for another five races as the season progressed, and Wilson finished a season-best second earlier this month at Mid-Ohio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He said after the race that he raced clean and did not take any risks that would have jeopardized eventual race-winner Rahal because Rahal was part of the championship race and Wilson was not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Wilson broke a bone in his back at Mid-Ohio in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>He missed the final six races of the season and wore a back brace for more than two months as he was restricted from any physical activity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The injury kept him out of the season finale at Las Vegas and the race where Wheldon died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>He broke his pelvis and suffered a bruised lung in the 2013 season finale at Fontana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Wilson said in 2012 his injuries and Wheldon's death did nothing to change his perspective or make him question his career choice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>''I've had the conversation with Julia - this is what we do, and you try to make the best plans if that ever happens,'' Wilson told The Associated Press upon his return in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>''You've got to know the risks and work out if those risks are acceptable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>To me, it's acceptable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>But I'm not going to stop trying to improve it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>''All the drivers, this IndyCar, we're always trying to make it safer, but at the end of the day, it's a race car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>We're racing hard, we're racing IndyCars and it's fast.</td></tr>
