<h3>Manly set for successful 2015: Foran</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Manly's worst fears were realised on Monday when Foran joined star halves partner Daly Cherry-Evans in agreeing terms to leave Brookvale at the end of this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However former Manly junior Foran insisted on Tuesday he has unfinished business at the Sea Eagles, the club he and Cherry-Evans led to the 2011 premiership, as it chases an 11th straight finals appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I guess from the club's (Manly's) point of view it is not something you would like to see but I'm glad its over," said Foran of the pair's contract talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It is a great weight off our shoulders and I think we can both put our best foot forward now and move on and play our best footy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I wanted to make a decision for myself and my family, that is the main reason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This is a really great footy club. It is going to continue to be a winning club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Moving forward, I have no doubt we will have a successful year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Foran's relationship with Eels coach Brad Arthur, a former Manly assistant, was also a crucial factor in the Kiwi playmaker's decision to move across town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Foran insisted Manly coach Geoff Toovey still had a future as an NRL head coach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>" I think the people who are involved, Tooves and his coaching staff Dave Penna and Steve Georgallis are doing a wonderful job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Ultimately in the end I saw the Parramatta option as the best one for myself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"That's next year. I don't really want to comment on that. But I think Tooves has done a great job over the past couple of years, the results speak for themselves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Foran missed last week's round two win over Melbourne and said he was still a couple of weeks away from a return from his hamstring injury suffered in the round one loss to Parramatta.</td></tr>
