<h3>Greece finance minister vows compromise in loan talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) " Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis is promising to compromise in negotiations over the next installment of a bailout loan that would forestall Greece's possible exit from the European currency union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yet Varoufakis also denounces some of the reforms demanded by the country's European creditors, suggesting the two sides remain far apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Varoufakis says in remarks at the Brookings Institution that his government was elected to "challenge the logic of a program that has clearly failed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His comments came as Greece's borrowing costs soared Thursday amid growing fears of a debt default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece is shuffling funds among government agencies and delaying payments to suppliers to repay its loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greek officials hope that an agreement can be reached next week, but officials from Germany and other European nations have suggested that's unlikely.</td></tr>
