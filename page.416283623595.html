<h3>Pope pleas to Kenya university gunmen to 'come to their senses'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Thursday appealed to Somali Islamist militants who killed 148 people at a Kenyan university this month to stop their brutality and "come to their senses".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He told Kenyan bishops visiting the Vatican that he prayed for those killed by acts of terror, ethnic and tribal hostilities in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I think most especially of the men and women killed at Garissa University College," the leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"May those who commit such brutality come to their senses and seek mercy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The gunmen hunted down Christians while sparing Muslims in the attack on April 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Francis has repeatedly expressed alarm about Christians being targeted for their faith and condemned the beheading of 21 Egyptian Copts in Libya in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He urged the visiting bishops to work with Christian and non-Christian leaders to promote peace in predominantly-Christian Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Al Shabaab said Garissa was revenge for Kenya sending troops into Somalia to fight alongside African Union peacekeepers against the Islamist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>(This version of the story removes pope's reference in paragraph 3 to the attack taking place on Good Friday, April 3. The attack was on April 2.)</td></tr>
