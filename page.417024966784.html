<h3>Google to test bubble-shaped self-driving cars in Silicon Valley</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO - The world is one step closer to the day when people can, in good conscience, drive to work while sipping coffee, texting with a friend and working on a laptop computer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Friday, Google announced that sometime this summer several prototype versions of its self-driving cars are set to hit the streets of Mountain View, Calif., the search giant's hometown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The move is still just another round of testing but it is a significant step toward a pilot program in which regular consumers could ride in self-driving cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Google has long been testing its self-driving car technology with a fleet of Lexus sport-utility vehicles that have driven about 1 million miles on public roads, and that continue to put in 10,000 miles a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Traditional automakers are also pushing the envelope of driverless tech with on-the-road testing of their own autonomous prototypes, and the industry predicts that by 2020 those dreams could come true.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In essence, the cars need an electronic brain that knows how to drive in a world where human drivers, as well as pedestrians and bicyclists, often do unpredictable things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They also need to understand regional differences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Drivers in Boston, for instance, often behave differently than those in Atlanta or Los Angeles, where unspoken rules of the road and cultural cues can vary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>City environments are particularly challenging, and require software with much more flexibility and power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That's one of the reasons Google (and its rival, Apple) hope their software acumen can help them solve the puzzle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And now that Google will be testing its new bubble-shaped cars on public roads near its Mountain View headquarters, it's getting one step closer to honing its predictive technology for urban settings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Google's prototype, which looks like a golf cart with doors, is designed to be a fully autonomous car in which people get in, set their destination and relax as the car does the work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The prototypes cannot go faster than 25 mph and, for now, have a steering wheel and pedals so that a "safety driver" could take over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Of course, nothing is accident-proof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>This week, Chris Urmson, director of Google's Self-Driving Car Project, disclosed that self-driving cars had been in 11 "minor accidents" in which there was only light damage and no injuries, and that "not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This included seven rear-end collisions, a couple of wrecks in which cars were sideswiped and one crash in which the self-driving car was hit by a driver who rolled through a stop sign.</td></tr>
