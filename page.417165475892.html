<h3>Red carpet Emergency Room at Cannes is always full of drama</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - For most of the year, room 331 of the Martinez Hotel is just your run-of-the mill luxury five star hotel suite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But during the Cannes Film Festival, it is radically transformed into a red carpet emergency room - where celebrities like Naomi Watts and Nicole Kidman can rush if they pop out of a dress, or a zipper breaks minutes before their film premieres at the Cannes Palais, the festival HQ just a stone's throw away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Paris fashion house Elie Saab is room 331's occupant this year, equipped with fitters, assistants and tailors in full war mode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There's always drama," said Emilie Legendre Guillaumaud, Elie Saab's head of communications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This year we've dressed Naomi Watts, with Lea Seydoux, Sonam Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai coming in here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The last day is the one normally packed with the most drama, she said, because winning actresses are often called back unexpectedly for the awards ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That happened to Cannes best actress winner Berenice Bejo, star of "The Artist," who in 2013 had to be flown in at the eleventh hour from Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It was the very last minute before the ceremony that we had to fit her," said Legendre Guillaumaud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It's very stressful."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Martinez's close proximity - half a mile - from the festival location makes it a perfect location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Top actresses can hop into their limos and be driven down the glamorous croisette in style, with spectators unaware of the drama that has just transpired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Legendre Guillaumaud recounts how the entourage of Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi once rushed in within minutes of the ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Major alterations were needed so we just cut the dress, and the stylist ran off along with it," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Sometimes the red carpet emergency room team needs to go into the Palais to sew actresses into dresses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That is especially the case for members of the Cannes jury, who are holed up in a bunker before the awards ceremony, sequestered from the press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"One member of the jury, actress Alexandra Maria Lara, was in the bunker and burst out of the dress and the zipper broke," said Legendre Guillaumaud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We literally had to stitch her into it back stage just before she went on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The red carpet can be a cruel world - but there is help out there.</td></tr>
