<h3>A history of the Islamic State group as Iraq retakes Tikrit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The monthlong offensive to retake Tikrit, the hometown of Saddam Hussein some 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Baghdad, is the biggest victory yet for Iraq since the extremists' campaign last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, the Islamic State group remains a potent threat, Western officials warn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>April 18, 2010 " U.S. and Iraqi forces kill two top al-Qaida in Iraq leaders, allowing al-Baghdadi to become the leader of a terror group weakened by a concerted campaign aimed at ending a Sunni insurgency in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Oct. 31, 2010 " Al-Baghdadi's al-Qaida militants attack Our Lady of Salvation Catholic church in Baghdad during Sunday night mass, killing 58 people in the deadliest assault targeting Christians since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion there. The militants reportedly demand the release of Muslim women they claim were held by Egypt's Coptic Christian church.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Oct. 4, 2011 " The U.S. puts a $10 million bounty on al-Baghdadi's head over a series of attacks he orchestrated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>July 21, 2012 " In his first purported online message, al-Baghdadi promises to regain lost ground in Iraq and calls on militants to "chase and liquidate the judges, the investigators and the guards." Within days, his group begins a campaign of attacks, car bombings and other assaults killing hundreds. He also mentions Syria, in the grips of a civil war pitting largely Sunni rebels against embattled President Bashar Assad. By this time, al-Baghdadi already has begun to send fighters there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>April 2013 " Al-Baghdadi announces his group has taken over the Nusra Front, the al-Qaida affiliate in Syria. Nusra denies the takeover, sparking anger and infighting that continues to this day.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>Early February 2014 " Al-Qaida breaks with al-Baghdadi's group, now known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

<tr><td>11</td><td>June 10 " Al-Baghdadi's fighters take over Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul, followed by Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit and smaller communities in the Sunni heartland as government forces melt away.</td></tr>

<tr><td>22</td><td>Jan. 24 " A message claims the Islamic State group beheads Japanese hostage Haruna Yukawa, a 42-year-old adventurer, after earlier demanding $200 million for him and captive Japanese journalist Kenji Goto.
