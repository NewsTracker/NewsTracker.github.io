<h3>Beltran, Yankees rally, end Toronto's 11-game winning streak (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TORONTO (AP) -- Carlos Beltran came off the bench and did something no Yankees player had done in more than 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pretty timely, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Beltran hit a huge three-run homer in the eighth inning, Andrew Miller escaped a big jam in the ninth and New York stopped Toronto's 11-game winning streak, beating the Blue Jays 4-3 Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was New York's first go-ahead, pinch-hit home run in the eighth inning or later of a road game since Don Mattingly did it against the Angels in July 1994.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''As soon as I hit it, I knew it was going to leave the ballpark,'' Beltran said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Miller struck out Ben Revere and Troy Tulowitzki with runners on second and third to close out the victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The win moved the Yankees a half-game ahead of Toronto and back into first place in the AL East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>David Price took a 3-0 lead into the eighth before New York rallied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He left after Chase Headley's RBI double and Beltran then greeted reliever Aaron Sanchez (6-5) with a pinch-hit, three-run homer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''I didn't get my job done and it cost us a win,'' Sanchez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ivan Nova (5-4) wound up with the win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Dellin Betances pitched the eighth and Miller finished for his 26th save, fanning Tulowitzki to end a 12-pitch sequence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''I was running out of gas there,'' Miller said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A one-out walk and single, plus a wild pitch by Miller with one out put the Blue Jays in position in the ninth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Tulowitzki kept fouling off pitches during the tense at-bat, which included several mound meetings between Miller and catcher Brian McCann.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Tulowitzki swung and missed at a full-count pitch, silencing a sellout crowd at Rogers Centre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''Two of the best players in baseball,'' Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''That's what people want to see, pay to see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Toronto lost for the first time in 14 games with Tulowitzki in the starting lineup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Blue Jays, who swept a three-game series in the Bronx last weekend while giving up a total of one run, had gone 33 innings without allowing a run to the Yankees until they broke through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''Hopefully its gives us confidence,' manager Joe Girardi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>That shutout streak is the longest the Yankees have gone without scoring against a single opponent, eclipsing 31-inning streaks against Detroit in 1934 and the Washington Senators in 1913.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Blue Jays failed to win a franchise-best 12th game for the fifth time in team history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Toronto has won 11 straight twice this season, also doing it in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Price won with seven shutout innings at Yankee Stadium last weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He was in control this time, too, in the opener of a three-game set before the Yankees scored four times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''I thought we did a pretty good job against a really good pitcher,'' Girardi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Beltran's homer stopped a 25-inning scoreless streak by Toronto's bullpen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Blue Jays relievers hadn't allowed a run since the ninth inning of an Aug. 2 win over Kansas City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>All three Blue Jays runs came in the third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Tulowitzki hit an RBI grounder, Jose Bautista doubled home a run and Edwin Encarnacion hit a sacrifice fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>New York's Alex Rodriguez came in hitless in 11 at-bats but doubled in the first, his first extra-base hit since Aug. 6.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Former Yankees RHP Joba Chamberlain exercised an opt-out clause in his contract and was granted his release by Toronto's Triple-A team in Buffalo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Yankees: Girardi said DH Alex Rodriguez will likely sit out either Saturday or Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Blue Jays: Encarnacion returned at DH after missing the previous four games with a sore left middle finger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Yankees: RHP Masahiro Tanaka (8-5, 3.79 ERA) will have had five days of rest when he faces Toronto for the second straight start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Tanaka allowed solo home runs to Donaldson and Bautista in Sunday's 2-0 defeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Blue Jays: RHP Marco Estrada (10-6, 3.21 ERA) seeks to win his fourth straight start when he faces the Yankees on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Estrada blanked New York over 6 1-3 innings last Sunday as Toronto capped a three-game sweep in the Bronx.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He has allowed only one home run in his past seven outings.</td></tr>
