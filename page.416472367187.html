<h3>Recap: Toronto vs. Baltimore</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Toronto, ON (SportsNetwork.com) - Drew Hutchison carried a perfect game into the sixth inning, and the Toronto Blue Jays held off a comeback effort in the ninth to notch a 7-6 victory over the Baltimore Orioles that completed a series sweep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hutchison (2-0) held the Orioles to two runs and four hits while fanning seven without a walk over eight outstanding innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He exited with a 7-2 lead that was cut down to a run after Baltimore scored four times in the ninth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Manny Machado's second homer of the night, a three-run shot off Miguel Castro, brought the Orioles within 7-6 before the Toronto rookie retired the next three hitters to finish off the Blue Jays' first three-game sweep of Baltimore since June of 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Blue Jays have amassed 47 runs in winning five of their six meetings with the Orioles this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Josh Donaldson went 2-for-4 with a two-run homer for Toronto, which battered Chris Tillman en route to building a 7-0 lead after five innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Machado broke up Hutchison's perfect game bid with a solo homer in the sixth, while Adam Jones finished 2-for-4 with two runs scored in the Orioles' fourth consecutive loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tillman (2-2) turned in a second straight dud against Toronto, which rocked the righty for seven runs in 2 2/3 innings in Baltimore on April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He was plagued by three walks while permitting five hits -- four of which went for extra bases -- in Thursday's outing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tillman's command began to desert him in the bottom of the third inning, which began with a walk to Danny Valencia and Pillar's infield single.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Following a sacrifice bunt and Devon Travis' fielder's choice grounder in which Valencia beat Chris Davis' throw home, Donaldson crushed a flat changeup off the facade of the upper deck in left for a 3-0 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>More control problems came Tillman's way in the fourth, as he walked the first two hitters prior to yielding Valencia's RBI double that plated Justin Smoak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Pillar then smashed a ball off the third-base bag for a two-run double that increased Toronto's advantage to 6-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Other than a few pitches, I feel like I beat us tonight," Tillman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I walked way too many, I fell behind way too much."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Donaldson's leadoff double in the fifth led to another run charged to Tillman when Russell Martin greeted reliever Brad Brach with a two-out double.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Hutchison, meanwhile, kept on cruising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The right-hander needed just 28 pitches his first time through the Baltimore lineup and threw only 56 while still perfect after five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I felt like I was doing a good job being aggressive in the zone," Hutchison said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I got a good tempo going, got my fastball going and just keeping ahead of guys, that was the difference."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Machado drove his initial offering in the sixth over the wall in left, however, to end the bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Orioles put up another run in the seventh when Jones doubled, took third on a Delmon Young single and came home on Travis Snider's fielder's choice force out, then put quite a scare into the home crowd in the ninth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>After Jones, Young and Snider all singled off Liam Hendricks to produce a run, Machado worked the count full against Castro before drilling a fastball into the left-field seats to trim the deficit to 7-6.</td></tr>
