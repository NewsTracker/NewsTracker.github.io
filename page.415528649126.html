<h3>Nintendo is making games for smartphones</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>After long resisting making games for mobile phones, Nintendo announced a partnership with Japanese mobile gaming company DeNA on Tuesday to make smartphone games featuring Nintendo characters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This doesn't mean we'll be seeing the original "Super Mario Bros." leaping onto smartphones anytime soon, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a statement, DeNA said "only new, original games optimized for smart device functionality will be created, rather than porting games created specifically for the Wii U home console or the Nintendo 3DS portable system."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The decision, DeNA said, is for quality control, because games originally designed for Nintendo's consoles aren't likely to play well on smartphones due to different controls and screen sizes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The partnership will also involve the two companies developing a cross-platform service set to launch this fall that will run across mobile devices, PCs and Nintendo's own devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nintendo is also buying a 10% stake in DeNA, while DeNA is buying a 1.24% stake in Nintendo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Both acquisitions are worth 22 billion yen ($182 million).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Payment is due April 2, the companies said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nintendo has long been fiercely protective of its intellectual property, keeping its characters and franchises like Mario and Pokemon exclusive to its own devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The partnership with DeNA is a significant move for the company, which has in recent years struggled with low sales of its Wii U console, a device that has so far failed to replicate the success of the Wii, which was released in 2006.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said at a press conference in Tokyo on Tuesday that the move doesn't mean Nintendo is giving up on the console business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said the company is working on a new console with a "brand new concept," codenamed NX.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>More details on the console are expected to be announced next year.</td></tr>
