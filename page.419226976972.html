<h3>Syrian hard-line faction backs US-Turkey plans for safe zone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BEIRUT (AP) - A Syrian hard-line Islamic faction has expressed strong support for a U.S.-Turkish plan to set up a safe zone in northern Syria free of the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham group says such a zone is "vital" and serves the interests of the Syrian people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tuesday's statement suggests the powerful group is seeking to position itself as a main faction on the ground that could work with the United States and Turkey to carve out such an IS-free zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The statement came a day after Al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria, the Nusra Front, said it's withdrawing from areas along the border with Turkey where it has been fighting IS militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Turkey began carrying out airstrikes against IS targets in Syria two weeks ago.</td></tr>
