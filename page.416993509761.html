<tr><td>4</td><td>Harvey Weinstein offered a peek at Quentin Tarantino's film "The Hateful Eight" at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday as the movie mogul previewed the Weinstein Co.'s upcoming slate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The annual presentation to media and industry members featured a handful of films that will premiere at Cannes in the coming days: Todd Haynes' 1950s drama "Carol" and a "Macbeth" adaption with Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One of the Cannes festival jury members, Jake Gyllenhaal, was also on hand to preview his boxing drama with director Antoine Fuqua: "Southpaw."</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>He later withdrew the lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It's Tarantino's eighth film with Weinstein, who called it "the best marriage I've had."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He asked reporters not to tell that quip to his wife, Georgina Chapman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Weinstein also confirmed reports that his company will distribute "Hands of Steel," which stars Edgar Ramirez as boxer Roberto Duran and Robert De Niro as his trainer, Ray Arcel.</td></tr>
