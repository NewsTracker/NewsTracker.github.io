<tr><td>8</td><td>Newlyweds Valasia Limnioti, right, and Konstantinos Patronis walk in Manhattan on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Newlyweds Valasia Limnioti and Konstantinos Patronis' long-planned "dream trip" to the U.S. ended in New York City, where their three-week honeymoon quickly turned into a nightmare: Their Greek-issued credit and debit cards were suddenly declined and they were left penniless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We were hungry, and I cried for two days," Limnioti said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I felt homeless in New York."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The couple skipped a few meals before spending their last dollars on dinner at McDonald's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Strangers from two Greek Orthodox churches in the city's Queens borough came to the rescue, giving them survival cash until their flight home to Greece on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The couple's U.S. adventure started after their June 6 wedding in Volos, Greece, a port city several hours north of Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Their coast-to-coast U.S. trip that took in Los Angeles and a Caribbean cruise "was the dream trip of our lives," Limnioti said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They had saved for a whole year to pre-pay for flights and hotels, with enough cash left for both necessities and pleasures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Two Greek banks issued them cards before the trip - a Visa credit card and a debit card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Everything was all right - then 'boom!' in New York," Limnioti said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Their midtown Manhattan hotel asked them to pay a $45 surcharge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>That's when their cards bounced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>They paid with their dwindling funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Within days, the couple ran out of cash and "we couldn't withdraw any money - zero," Limnioti said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>On Tuesday, in despair, they reached out to the New York-based Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, which contacted the churches in Queens' Astoria neighborhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The honeymooners were offered about $350 from the St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox church and another nearby one, St. Irene Chrysovalantou.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I said to them, 'Don't worry, that's why we're here,' " said the Rev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Vasilios Louros of St. Demetrios.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"This is the church of Christ and we always help people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The money was withdrawn from the church's bank account, "and that was it," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In addition, an undisclosed amount came from a New York-based Greek journalist who hails from Volos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The couple insisted they'd pay back the money but were told it was a gift, said Limnioti, speaking on her cellphone Wednesday from the American Museum of Natural History.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>She said relatives in Greece told them other Greeks abroad also were left penniless, including some patients in U.S. hospitals who cannot pay for medical care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>She said she's speaking out "because we Greeks are a proud people, and I want the world to know that we are not in this situation because we're lazy or did something wrong."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Their financial woes won't be over once they get home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>With banks closed, Greece faces a deep financial crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Greeks will vote Sunday in a referendum on whether to back more spending cuts, more tax increases and more negotiations with European creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>A rejection of such draconian measures could trigger a Greek exit from the Eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Limnioti, 36, is unemployed after the small business for which she worked failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Her 39-year-old husband still has his job as a helicopter engineer for the Greek military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>But in every sense, the couple's honeymoon is over, with a financial sword of Damocles looming over their country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"There are only three things saving us now: our families, our friends and our God," Limnioti said.</td></tr>
