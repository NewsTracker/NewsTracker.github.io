<h3>Juror's medical problem slows trial in girl's running death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - Jurors received differing pictures of the relationship between an Alabama woman and the granddaughter she is accused of running to death, with a principal testifying Tuesday that she saw no problems and a doctor saying she was worried about odd family dynamics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The contrasting testimony came as the defense also tried to raise new doubts about the victim's autopsy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Joyce Hardin Garrard, 49.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She is accused of making 9-year-old granddaughter Savannah Hardin run for hours as punishment for a lie about candy on Feb. 17, 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The girl collapsed and died days later, and neighbors testified earlier that they saw the woman forcing the girl to run even after she vomited and begged to stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Garrard, of Boaz, says she is innocent, and two defense witnesses who passed the property that day have testified that they only saw Garrard and the child picking up sticks, not any running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Longtime elementary school principal Donna Joy Bone Johnson testified that she didn't see any cause for concern in the relationship between Garrard and the girl, who attended her school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Johnson portrayed Garrard as the primary caregiver for the girl, the daughter of Garrard's son Robert Hardin, who was overseas at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Savannah was "a competitor" who wanted to do well in school and athletics, Johnson said, and Garrard often came to school to talk with her about Savannah's behavior or seek advice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I've been doing this a long time. There were no red flags," said Johnson, the sister of Garrard's lead attorney, Dani Bone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The child's pediatrician testified that she worried about the relationship between Garrard, the child, and stepmother Jessica Mae Hardin, who also is charged in the girl's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Dr. Deborah Smith said the relationship among the three "was not a normal dynamic" and that she had considered contacting authorities but didn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Smith didn't explain exactly what she considered to be odd, and a prosecutor didn't press her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Earlier prosecution witnesses testified that Garrard was in the yard with the child for hours making her run and pick up sticks and firewood while Hardin sat on the porch with a laptop computer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Garrard is charged with capital murder while Hardin faces the lesser charge of murder for allegedly failing to intervene and help the child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The defense has tried to show that the child's autopsy was flawed and doesn't match the allegations from Garrard's indictment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Defense lawyers called a former forensics worker to try to bolster those claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Chris Crow, who helped Dr. Emily Ward with the post-mortem investigation, testified that a report indicated Ward didn't have the girl's medical records before conducting the autopsy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The final autopsy report wasn't completed until weeks after Garrard already had been indicted, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Crow said the autopsy took Ward only an hour, which he described as "pretty quick" for such an examination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But Crow testified under cross-examination that Ward was more experienced than other pathologists in her office, possibly accounting for her speed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And Crow said that he, Ward and others attended a meeting during which prosecutors were given detailed medical information about the girl's death before Garrard was charged, even though the final autopsy wasn't complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The autopsy blamed the girl's death on seizures caused by a low sodium level linked to prolonged physical exertion and heat exhaustion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A defense expert, former state medical examiner Dr. James Lauridson, raised questions about the girl's autopsy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Lauridson agreed with autopsy results that showed the girl's death was linked to seizures and extreme exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I agree that this case would not have happened had there not been physical exertion," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But Lauridson disagreed with Ward, who said the girl was dehydrated and suffered heat exhaustion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Savannah's low sodium levels actually were caused by overhydration, said Lauridson, and there were no signs of heat illness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Too much water caused too low salt," said Lauridson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He said he would have ruled the manner of death undetermined, rather than homicide.</td></tr>

<h3>As Israelis vote, Netanyahu rules out Palestinian state</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But with the sides nearly evenly divided, a victory by Netanyahu's Likud Party still was not guaranteed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His chief rival, Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Union, said he would make "every effort" to form a government, and an upstart centrist party led by a former Netanyahu ally-turned-rival was set to be the kingmaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The country now heads into what could be weeks of negotiations over the makeup of the next coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Both Netanyahu and Herzog will now compete for a chance to form a coalition that commands a majority in the 120-seat parliament, a daunting task in Israel's fractured political landscape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Netanyahu appeared to have a better chance of cobbling together a government with right-wing and religious parties that he calls his "natural allies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Herzog would have to appeal to more ideologically diverse parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Either will likely need the support of Moshe Kahlon, whose new Kulanu party captured nine or 10 seats, according to polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kahlon, whose campaign focused almost entirely on bread-and-butter economic issues, refused to take sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I am loyal to my way," he told his supporters, saying he would work to form a government committed to social justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The election was widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who has governed the country for the past six years, and recent opinion polls had given Herzog a slight lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As the results were announced on the nation's three major TV stations, celebrations erupted at Likud's campaign headquarters in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Against all the odds we obtained a great victory for the Likud," Netanyahu told the gathering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Now we must form a strong and stable government that will ensure Israel's security and welfare," he added, in comments aimed at Kahlon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He said he had already been in touch with all other nationalist parties in hopes of quickly forming a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Netanyahu focused his campaign on security issues, while his opponents instead pledged to address the country's high cost of living and accused the leader of being out of touch with everyday people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Herzog also promised to repair tattered ties with the U.S. and to revive peace efforts with the Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>At a rally of his supporters, Herzog vowed to do his utmost to form a government and said he too had reached out to potential coalition partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In a nod to Kahlon, he said he was committed to forming a "real social reconciliation government" committed to lowering the country's cost of living and reducing gaps between rich and poor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Netanyahu's return to power would likely spell trouble for Mideast peace efforts and could further escalate tensions with the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Netanyahu, who already has a testy relationship with President Barack Obama, took a sharp turn to the right in the final days of the campaign, staking out a series of hard-line positions that will put him at odds with the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In a dramatic policy reversal, he said he now opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a key policy goal of the White House and the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He also promised to expand construction in Jewish areas of east Jerusalem, the section of the city claimed by the Palestinians as their capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Netanyahu infuriated the White House early this month when he delivered a speech to the U.S. Congress criticizing an emerging nuclear deal with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The speech was arranged with Republican leaders and not coordinated with the White House ahead of time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama was confident strong U.S.-Israeli ties would endure far beyond the election regardless of the victor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Palestinians, fed up after years of deadlock with Netanyahu, are now likely to press ahead with their attempts to bring war crimes charges against Israel in the International Criminal Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"What Netanyahu is doing and stating are war crimes and if the international community wants peace it should make Netanyahu accountable for his acts," said Palestinian official Saeb Erekat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He said the Palestinian leadership will meet Thursday to discuss its next steps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Exit polls on Israel's three main TV stations showed Likud and the Zionist Union in a near deadlock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Channels One and 10 gave Likud a 27-26 lead in the 120-seat parliament, while Channel 2 gave Likud a 28-27 edge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>That breakdown could change as final results pour in on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Under Israel's fragmented electoral system, either Netanyahu or Herzog will have to court potential partners to secure a 61-seat majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Herzog could potentially try to build a coalition that would rely on support from a new Arab alliance that captured 12 to 13 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But Arab parties have never sat in an Israeli coalition before, complicating any potential deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Stav Shaffir, a leader of the Zionist Union, called the results a "clear vote of no confidence in Netanyahu."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>She said the Zionist Union would wait for the official results before declaring victory or defeat, but claimed Netanyahu's opponents "have a majority."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Netanyahu has ruled out a "unity" government with the Zionist Union that would give him a broad coalition, and Herzog has also been cool to the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>That would indicate the next government will be a narrow majority - a recipe for further instability in which any member could bring it down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The previous government lasted less than two years before crumbling apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>President Reuven Rivlin will now spend the next few days consulting with the various parties, whose leaders will all offer recommendations for who should be prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Based on those consultations, he will ask either Netanyahu or Herzog to begin the process of forming a coalition.</td></tr>
