<h3>Time running out on Greek debt talks, says top EU official</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Time running out on Greek debt talks, says top EU official Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece is not moving fast enough to draw up and implement structural reforms and there is limited time to prevent it running out of cash, European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The mood between Greece's newly-elected leftist government and its euro zone partners has been tense during negotiations that will determine whether the cash-strapped country gets further, much-needed financial aid from its EU/IMF lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Talks are very complicated. Time is running out," Dombrovskis told Reuters in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Greece should come up with an ambitious reform list in line with its bailout program and also start to implement it," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A meeting of deputy finance ministers - called the Euro Working Group - on Thursday gave Athens a six working day deadline to present a revised economic reform plan before euro zone finance ministers meet on April 24 to decide whether to unlock emergency funding to keep Greece afloat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dombrovskis noted that April 24 was not a formal deadline to reach a deal with Greece, but the country's financial difficulties were pressing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Technical teams from Greece and its international lenders held a teleconference on Saturday to outline the agenda of talks over the next few days, a Greek finance ministry official said at the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In other comments, Dombrovskis said the recent sharp depreciation of the euro against the dollar reflected the different monetary policy stances of the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The euro remains "quite far" from its historic lows against the dollar, noted Dombrovskis, a Latvian whose responsibilities at the Commission include overseeing the euro.</td></tr>
