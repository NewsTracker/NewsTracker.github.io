<h3>Spieth beats Gillis in playoff, wins John Deere Classic (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Jordan Spieth made it a lot tougher on himself than it needed to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the end, Spieth got exactly what he was looking for from the John Deere Classic: a win and some positive energy ahead of the British Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Spieth beat Tom Gillis on the second hole of a playoff to win at TPC Deere Run on Sunday for his fourth victory of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gillis and Spieth, who opened the tournament with an even-par 71, finished the final round at 20-under 264.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Zach Johnson and Danny Lee tied for third at 19 under.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''To be able to shoot 20-under in three rounds is nice momentum,'' Spieth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''The finish, when I really didn't feel like tee to green I had much (Sunday), gives me a lot of momentum to draw on if I don't have my best stuff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 46-year-old Gillis, who was attempting to become the oldest first-time winner on the PGA Tour in 20 years, sent an approach into the water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Spieth made par for his second win at this tournament in three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Now Spieth heads to the British Open in search of his third consecutive major championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Spieth is the first golfer to win four times before the Open Championship since Tiger Woods in 2000 - and he silenced many of the critics who questioned why he played this tournament instead of heading overseas early to prepare for St. Andrews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''I really didn't care anyways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I came here for a reason, and we accomplished that reason,'' Spieth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After shooting a career-best 10 under on Saturday, Spieth entered the final round with a two-shot lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the field caught up to Spieth when he turned in a pedestrian front nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Spieth bogeyed two of his first three holes and was soon passed by the likes of Gillis and Johnson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Spieth was even at the turn and two shots back of Gillis, who in 171 previous PGA Tour starts had only finished in the top three twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Spieth's low point was a bogey on the par-4 11th hole after a putt from the fringe went left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But Gillis played his final six holes at even par.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Spieth roared back into contention with four birdies in five holes, including a 21-foot chip from the fringe on No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Spieth had a 30-foot putt for the win on No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>18, but he pushed it left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He nearly won on the first hole of the playoff, but his 33-foot try lipped out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Even though Spieth ultimately outlasted the field, he knows he has some work to do - specifically with his driver, which abandoned him at times this weekend - if he hopes to make it three majors in a row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''I need to fine tune my driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>I love where my putter is at.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>My pace control, my speed is awesome right now,'' Spieth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Gillis matched Spieth with a par on the first hole in sudden death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But a tee shot that went into the rough led to a shot in the water, effectively ending his bid for an elusive victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Gillis shot a 7-under 64 in the final round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''When you're going to be 47, the window is closing,'' Gillis said.</td></tr>
