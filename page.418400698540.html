<h3>UK advises British nationals to leave Tunisia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(CNN)Britain's Foreign Office is advising British nationals to leave Tunisia, saying an additional terrorist attack is "highly likely."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The warning comes after an attack at a beach hotel that left at least 38 people dead, most of whom were British citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"If you're in Tunisia and you don't have an essential need to remain you should leave by commercial means," read an updated advisory issued Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The ministry acknowledged additional security measures put in place by the Tunisian government since the attack, but it said they were insufficient to protect British tourists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Over the weekend, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi declared a 30-day state of emergency, giving the military and police more authority to combat terrorism and placing restrictions on such rights as public assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That decision, too, was in response to the June 26 attack in which a gunman opened fire at the beachfront Hotel Riu Imperial Marhaba in the coastal city of Sousse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Terrorism is spreading," Essebsi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I believe, and I say this plainly and clearly: If this were to happen, which happened in Sousse, if this were to happen again, the country would collapse."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, but it is unclear whether the Islamist group had any direct role in it.</td></tr>
