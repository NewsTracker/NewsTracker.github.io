<h3>British sex offender who fled to Australia recaptured and deported after boasting about new life on Facebook</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A British sex offender who fled to Australia has been recaptured after boasting on Facebook about his new life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>British detectives learnt that Steven Allison was living in Sydney, and later Canberra, after he started posting photographs and details about himself on social media under the name "Steven Stig Allison".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Allison, 37, had been due to appear in court in West Yorkshire in northern England in February last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He was due to be sentenced for two sexual assaults committed during a drunken night out at a pub in Leeds in northern England, West Yorkshire Police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But on the day he was to be sentenced, he failed to turn up at court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In his absence, the judge sentenced him to 30 months in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>West Yorkshire Police said in a statement that they began searching for Allison and eventually tracked him to Australia where he was working on construction sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This week, he was deported to Britain, where he will serve his prison sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It was clear that Allison felt he could cheat justice by fleeing the country and escaping to Australia," Detective Inspector Ben McDonald, of the Bradford District Safeguarding Unit, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"However, the police will always pursue those wanted for serious crimes such as this, regardless of where they are in the world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Telegraph and Argus newspaper in Bradford reported that Allison was arrested in January and held in an Australian detention centre, while police made arrangements to have him deported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While he was being held in the detention centre, Allison feigned an arm injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He tried to escape while being taken to a medical centre to receive treatment, the newspaper reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His escape attempt failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Telegraph and Argus reported that Allison was initially charged following a confrontation with two women while he was out drinking at a pub in Yeadon in Leeds in June 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Allison had approached one of the women, who declined his advances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>As the two women later tried to leave the pub, Allison assaulted one of the women and groped her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In response, the woman's friend threw a drink over Allison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He then punched both women to the ground, the newspaper reported.</td></tr>
