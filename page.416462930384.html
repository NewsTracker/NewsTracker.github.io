<h3>Louisiana weapons case against Robert Durst dropped; federal charge remains</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Louisiana prosecutors on Thursday dismissed weapons charges against Robert Durst, the real estate scion accused of murder in California, officials said, but he still faces a similar case in federal court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Durst, 72, was charged last month in Los Angeles County with the 2000 killing of a longtime friend, Susan Berman, in a case recently chronicled in the HBO documentary series "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lawyers for Durst had pushed for a speedy extradition to California but earlier this week asked for more time to prepare his defense on the federal charge of being a felon in possession of a weapon that stemmed from his arrest last month in New Orleans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Durst was being held without bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The final episode of the HBO series aired a day after Durst's March 14 arrest at a New Orleans hotel, where authorities said he was staying under an assumed name with more than $40,000 in cash, a gun, about five ounces of marijuana and a latex mask.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Authorities have said they feared Durst was seeking to flee to Cuba.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His attorneys have argued that FBI agents who arrested him and initially searched his hotel room did so without proper cause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office chose to dismiss its case against Durst in deference to the federal charge but reserves the right to revisit it, said Christopher Bowman, a spokesman for the office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The federal charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The HBO series documented several police investigations of Durst over the years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a 2003 trial in Texas, Durst admitted to killing and dismembering a neighbor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He claimed he acted in self defense and was acquitted of murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He has also been suspected in the 1982 disappearance in New York of his wife, Kathleen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Toward the end of the series, Durst was presented with evidence of his handwriting appearing to match that of Berman's likely killer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Durst's voice was subsequently captured on a microphone after the interview concluded as saying he had "killed them all."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Durst has long been estranged from his family, which is known for its significant New York real estate holdings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Prosecutors have said he is worth some $100 million.</td></tr>
