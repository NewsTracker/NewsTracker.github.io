<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An Egyptian defendant holds a Quran in a Cairo courtroom cage as a judge issues a verdict in a case involving violence by soccer fans in Port Said in 2012 that left 74 people dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An Egyptian court on Tuesday upheld death sentences for 11 men who participated in a 2012 riot at a soccer stadium that killed more than 70 fans and injured at least 1,000 others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The court, whose session was televised live, sentenced one of the men to death in absentia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ten men were also sentenced to 15 years in prison, 14 received 10-year sentences, and 15 received five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Twenty-one defendents in the case were found innocent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The verdicts can be appealed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The judge had referred the death sentence in April to Egypt's Grand Mufti Shawqi Allam, the country's most senior religious authority, in a step required by law for convictions in capital cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The mufti's opinion is not binding and not made public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Yasser Sayed Ahmed, a lawyer for the family of one of the victims hailed the ruling as "extremely fair and satisfactory."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>During the riot in Port Said on Sep. 2, 2012, Al-Masry fans attacked Al-Ahly supporters with knives, clubs and rocks after the match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Witnesses and survivors described victims falling from the bleachers as they tried to escape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hundreds of others fled into an exit passage, only to be crushed against a locked gate with their rivals attacking from behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At one point, the stadium lights went out, plunging it into darkness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The match's TV sportscaster explained that authorities shut them off to "calm the situation."</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>Most of the victims of the 2012 riot belonged to Al-Ahly's "Ultras," an association of hardcore fans who have long been at odds with the nation's highly militarized police, taunting them with offensive slogans during matches and fighting them in street battles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Hardcore fans of other clubs also identify themselves by variations on the Ultras name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Soccer matches are often a flashpoint for violence in Egypt.</td></tr>

<tr><td>22</td><td>Since then Egypt has curbed the number of people allowed to attend matches and supporters have often tried to storm stadiums they are banned from entering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In February, at least 22 people were killed outside an Egyptian soccer stadium when security forces barred fans from entering, the public prosecutor's office said at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Most of the casualties suffocated when the crowd stampeded after police used tear gas to clear the fans trying to force their way into a league match between two Cairo clubs, Zamalek and Enppi, doctors and witnesses said.</td></tr>
