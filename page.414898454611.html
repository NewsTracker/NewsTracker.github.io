<h3>In camps, Nigerian refugees fear for family left to Boko Haram</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Talka, a 36-year-old trader from Nigeria's Borno state, fled attacks by Boko Haram Islamists with his two wives and four of their children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the chaos, though, his three daughters were separated from the family, last seen being dragged off by militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Now Talka fears Happy, aged seven, and Daga and Lakwa, both five, could be strapped up with explosives and dispatched as suicide bombers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I think of them all the time. I don't eat. I don't drink. I cannot sleep," Talka told Reuters at a refugee camp in Minawao, in north Cameroon, where rows of white tents now occupy fields where millet and coffee once grew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I don't know whether they are alive or not. They are very small and will not know what to do or defend themselves. I am dying inside," a fraught-looking Talka said, choking back tears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Girls as young as 10 are known to have been used as suicide bombers by the Sunni jihadist group, which has waged a six-year campaign to carve out a caliphate in northern Nigeria and is now increasingly attacking neighboring states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nigerian forces have launched an offensive on the militants while neighbors Niger, Chad and Cameroon are seeking to hold the militants within Nigeria's borders ahead of a ground-and-air offensive by a regional task-force due to start from the end of next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But there is deep concern over the plight of those forced to abandon their homes by the waves of fighting and killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Aid workers estimate at least 1 million people in Nigeria have abandoned their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Another 157,000 have fled into neighboring countries, according to U.N. figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Talka and his family fled their home in Ngoshe, a village in the Gwoza area that is the heartland of Boko Haram's insurgency, after waves of attacks by militants killed hundreds and forced 20,000 people to scatter into Cameroon in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They spent several weeks hiding in nearby hills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Then, on Oct. 1, the area was again attacked by Boko Haram fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"They were shooting all over. We ran in different directions and I lost my family," Talka said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Reunited with his wives and four of their seven children the next day, Talka crossed into Cameroon, where 32,000 Nigerians are crammed into the Minawao camp, initially built for 18,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Refugees lack toilets, water must be trucked in from afar and some have resorted to begging in nearby villages due to the shortage of food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Minawao is full of tales of suffering and escape like Talka's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Hassan Abba, a trader based in neighboring Benin, returned to his home in Ashigashiya, in Borno state, in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He was on holiday and hoping to set up a business and get married.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>These plans were torn up when Boko Haram militants stormed the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I ran into the bush, but my father and his brother were killed. They burned our house and everything I own."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Abba re-emerged to bury his father and uncle, before crossing into Cameroon, where he has been since January, sleeping in a hall with 46 other new arrivals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Nigeria has delayed by six weeks a presidential election that had been due on Feb. 14, partly to allow the military to contain the insurgency in the northeast, where millions risked being disenfranchised due to violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Few believe that the six-year uprising can be seriously dented in six weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But, for Abba and Talka in Minawao, reports of concerted action against the militant group are rekindling hopes of returning home to search for missing relatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"As soon as I hear Ngoshe is free, I'm going back," Talka said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I have to find my daughters whatever it takes."</td></tr>

<h3>Want a meal on 2 wheels? Utah bill could put brakes on bikes in Salt Lake City drive-thrus</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow Salt Lake restaurants to ban cyclists from drive-thru lanes, a move that would override a city rule passed just a few months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Since September, Salt Lake City has required restaurants to open drive-thru lanes to cyclists if the lobby is closed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A proposal from Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Johnny Anderson, R-Taylorsville, would prohibit cities from making such regulations and allow businesses to decide whether to serve cyclists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I don't believe it's appropriate for a city to do that," Anderson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"They've gone too far."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A Senate committee approved the bill Tuesday, and the full chamber is scheduled to hold a final vote Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Anderson thinks having bikes in drive-thrus is dangerous for cyclists and could lead to more accidents and robberies at drive-thru windows, although he said he is not aware of any such incidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>When the city was considering the rule, Salt Lake County Sheriff James Winder raised public safety concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said the hours when lobbies are usually closed, between 10 p.m. and 6 p.m., are particularly dangerous because of dimly lit drive-thru lanes and the increased presence of drivers under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A Salt Lake City police spokesman said the department has not noticed an increase in accidents since the rule took effect but has not been closely following the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Luke Garrott, who represents downtown on the Salt Lake City Council and originally proposed the pro-cyclist regulation, said the rule aims to help "correct the imbalance of the transportation system in Salt Lake City" and make it more accessible to people who do not want to drive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some restaurants were closing their lobbies in the evening but keeping drive-thrus open, said Garrott, meaning that only people in vehicles could order food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Allowing that situation contributed to residents' dependence on cars, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Utah Restaurant Association supports allowing businesses to decide on bikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The increased potential for crime or injury may cause liability insurance rates to rise, spokesman Andy Stevenson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A regional official for the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, a large liability insurance company, said the increased risk of allowing cyclists in drive-thrus would definitely be factored in to insurance premiums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Stevenson, who spoke in favor of the proposal during Tuesday's Senate committee hearing, said Salt Lake's rule is unusual.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The only other place with a similar provision is Maine, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Although Maine does not require that cyclists be served at drive-thru windows, it does have a law waiving liability for businesses that do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The risk and potential insurance increases are being overstated by those favoring the proposal, said Garrott, the city councilman, who called the concern about additional crime a "red herring."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Although many lawmakers say they support the bill, others are worried about getting involved in local politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sen. Gene Davis, a Salt Lake City Democrat, said it's not the state's place to nullify a local rule that went through the proper channels and received public feedback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Sen. Todd Weiler, a Woods Cross Republican, voted to move the bill forward but said Tuesday that he wasn't sure he supported it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Although he thinks businesses should be free to make their own decisions, he is uneasy with the idea of interfering with local government.</td></tr>
