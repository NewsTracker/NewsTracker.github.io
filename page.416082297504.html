<h3>Robert Durst indicted on weapons charges in New Orleans</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW ORLEANS - A prosecutor's spokesman says millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst has been indicted on two weapons charges from his March arrest in Louisiana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Chris Bowman of the Orleans Parish district attorney's office said Wednesday that a grand jury charged Durst with possession of a firearm by a felon, and possession of a firearm and a controlled dangerous substance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>His arrest related to those charges has kept Durst from being extradited to Los Angeles, where he's charged in the 2000 death of friend Susan Berman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Until his indictment Wednesday, Durst had been arrested but not formally charged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>According to testimony, an FBI agent recognized Durst in a New Orleans hotel March 14 and escorted him to his hotel room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Durst was arrested March 15 on the Los Angeles warrant and arrested separately on the weapons charges the next day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A hearing in the New Orleans case is scheduled for Thursday.</td></tr>
