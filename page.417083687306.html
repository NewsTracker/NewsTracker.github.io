<h3>Harry Styles grabs Niall Horan's crotch as One Direction win big at Billboard Music Awards</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>One Direction had a triumphant night at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And Harry Styles was obviously keen to get his hands on another prize as the group celebrated their double win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The cheeky 21-year-old was spotted grabbing bandmate Niall Horan's crotch as the group headed up to the stage to pick up their Top Touring Artist prize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While Niall, 21, leaned in for a hug from his pal as they celebrated their win, Harry aimed a little lower, casually grabbing hold of the singer's crotch as he got up from his seat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Niall laughed out loud but couldn't get his own back, as Harry, with a smirk on his face, quickly headed to the stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Top Touring Artist award was one of two gongs for the Brit band at Sunday night's ceremony, with the group also beating the likes of Maroon 5 and 5 Seconds of Summer to the Top Group/Duo award.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In one of their first public appearances since the shocking departure of their fifth member Zayn Malik earlier this year, fans were delighted when Liam Payne gave a shout out to their 'brother' during their acceptance speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>During the speech Niall also praised their loyal fans, saying: 'This is absolutely incredible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It's an incredible honour to be here and to be in that category.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's unbelievable to come out as the winner, so we just want to say a big thank you to all of you who voted for it, we want to say a massive thank you to Billboard and again to our super, super fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Earlier the four remaining members were anxious to reassure their millions of fans that 'we're not breaking up' as they chatted with Fashion Police host Giuliana Rancic on the red carpet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Despite a rollercoaster couple of months the group looked in great spirits as they joined the biggest names in music at the Vegas ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Coordinating on the red carpet, Harry, Niall, Liam and Louis all wore black blazers, with Liam bucking the skinny jeans trend of the other three with some smart trousers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Their two wins on Sunday brings their Billboard Awards tally up to five in total, with the group previously picking up the New Artist of the Year, Top Group/Duo and Top Pop Album prizes in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Let's face it, awards shows are all about the girls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Who's wearing which designer?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Who's showing too much skin?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Who needs to sack their stylist?</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But let's not forget about the boys and in particular our favourite boy band, One Direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They may be a four piece now but they're still a stylish little bunch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>At the Billboard Awards last night Harry Styles rocked his favourite label Saint Laurent while Niall Horan worked tailored Paul Smith and Louis Tomlinson went slightly leftfield wearing a T-shirt by Maison Margiela.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Every man needs a selection of classic tees in his wardrobe and for those who like to take a risk a print like this is the way to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The good news, if you want to dress your fella like 1D, is Louis' tee is available now at Mr Porter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Zayn announced that he was leaving via the boy band's official Facebook on March 25, breaking the hearts of millions who feared for the future of his heartthrob mates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>'My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined,' the singer said at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>'But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>I'd like to apologize to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight,' he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A few days ago, the band admitted their anger with Zayn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Speaking on TV for the first time as a four-piece, in an interview with James Corden on The Late Late Show on Thursday night, Liam said: 'At first we were a little bit angry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>We were surprised, but I think we all knew the general vibe that Zayn was feeling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>'There were certain parts of this job that Zayn loved and certain parts of the job that he didn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>If you don't like your job, you've got to follow your heart sometimes and go where you need to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Addressing the hostile Twitter exchange, which also involved record producer Naughty Boy, he added: 'I've never been very good at biting my tongue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Maybe I get it from my mum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It is one of those things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>'Twitter is great for connecting with the fans but if you also feel like saying something you probably shouldn't, it is good for that, or bad in this case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But it's all resolved, it's all good in the hood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Naughty Boy had posted a picture of himself with Zayn on his social media sites, writing 'caption this'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>A tweet soon followed Tomlinson, which read: 'Remember when you were 12 and you used to think those Mac filters for your pictures were cool haha!</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Naughty Boy responded directly, writing: 'and some people can't even sing..</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>but who's complaining when there's auto tune eh'.</td></tr>
