<h3>Part-time Ferguson mayor in full-time spotlight</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Despite calls for him to go, Knowles is the last man standing in Ferguson city government after a Justice Department report highly critical of the city's police force and court system prompted six officials to resign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FERGUSON, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(AP) - In the days since the release of a Justice Department report that found widespread racial bias in the Ferguson Police Department, the mayor of the St. Louis suburb has become a part-time public servant in a full-time spotlight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The attention has only intensified as six city employees - most notably the police chief and city manager - have been fired or stepped down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But Mayor James Knowles III remains, making just $4,200 a year in a job he called basically ceremonial before a white police officer shot an unarmed black 18-year-old in August, prompting weeks of sometimes-violent protests and the Justice Department inquiry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He's now so involved that he's opened a City Hall office and insists he will stay to see the city through the changes it must make.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Friday, five residents filed an affidavit seeking to recall Knowles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They have 60 days to collect enough signatures - 15 percent of registered voters in the last mayoral election - to qualify for a special election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Knowles said he has no plans to step aside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Obviously there are people on the street calling for my resignation, but my voicemail, my text messages and my Facebook are full with literally hundreds of people who want me to stay," Knowles said in an Associated Press interview Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Somebody has to show leadership, and I'm focused on how we can move this community forward."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He argues that Ferguson's city manager form of government made him more figurehead than administrator, leading the city council but lacking the power to do much else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But critics say he must have known about the lax police oversight, racial profiling and profit-driven court practices cited in the Justice Department report released March 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I want the mayor out," said Kayla Reed, 25, of the Organization for Black Struggle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"True accountability means clean house, top to bottom."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Knowles, who grew up in Ferguson, was just a few years out of Truman State University when he defeated an incumbent for election to the city council in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He was elected state chairman of the Missouri Federation of Young Republicans in 2008 and was on the fast-track, earning mention in 2009 in the St. Louis Business Journal's "30 Under 30" list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He was elected to his current post in 2011, becoming one of Missouri's youngest mayors, and re-elected without opposition in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But he was little known outside the area until Aug. 9, when Officer Darren Wilson shot 18-year-old Michael Brown and Ferguson found itself suddenly in the national spotlight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After the shooting, Knowles and Police Chief Tom Jackson became the public face of Ferguson, holding news conferences, hosting public forums and reaching out to civil rights leaders and protesters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Meanwhile, City Manager John Shaw, who made $120,000 a year until he resigned Tuesday, remained out of sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Assistant city manager, Pam Hylton, has been named the interim city manager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Knowles has a full-time job: general manager of the state-contracted motor vehicle license office in Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He said he typically works about 60 hours a week, evenly splitting the time between the two duties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Knowles has sought to be a reassuring presence for supporters and critics alike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>At a council meeting Tuesday, he sat patiently as some residents loudly called for his ouster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He was equally passive as others praised him and the council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>When a brief shouting match began between a city critic and supporter, he urged both sides to calm down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Knowles, who is white, has deep roots in the city of 21,000, where two-thirds of residents are black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He was a top wrestler at McCluer High School and has been an assistant wrestling coach at another mostly black high school for several years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He was drawn to politics in fourth grade, when his father ran for city council (he lost but won on a subsequent try.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Former Mayor Brian Fletcher, who worked alongside him when he was a young councilman, said Knowles has a bit of ego, like most politicians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He isn't up for re-election for another two years, and Fletcher believes he'll ride out the storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"He's in a tough situation," Fletcher said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"He's taken a lead. From the people I've talked to they're very pleased with the way he's handled himself under a very difficult circumstance, a very difficult time for our community."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But Rasheen Aldridge, director of Young Activists United St. Louis and a member of the Ferguson Commission appointed by Gov. Jay Nixon, believes Knowles needs to follow the police chief and city manager out the door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The Justice Department report - a companion to one that cleared Wilson of any wrongdoing - laid bare instances of racial profiling and bias in the police department and a municipal court system that profited largely on the backs of blacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"When all of this stuff was going on, there's no way you can be the mayor of the town and not look at how much money is coming in, and even if you see it you don't raise a concern," Aldridge said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"This is his city. He's the mayor, and he needs to be held accountable."</td></tr>

<h3>Bea Arthur took 'Maude' out of 'Family's' shadow</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Cousin Maude's Visit," the Dec. 11, 1971, episode of the groundbreaking CBS comedy series "All in the Family," introduced TV audiences to the unforgettable Maude Findlay, the outspoken, liberal and feminist cousin of Edith (Jean Stapleton) who took no guff from conservative Archie (Carroll O'Connor) even when he called her a "big-mouth buttinski."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Producer Norman Lear recalled that the episode was airing on the East Coast when he got a call from the network's programming head, Fred Silverman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Silverman told Lear that Maude, broughtvividly to life by Bea Arthur, deserved a series of her own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And Lear couldn't have agreed more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Arthur in 1977 with her then-husband, director Gene Saks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The actress in 1975.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The cast of the "The Golden Girls."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Arthur, left, with Rue McClanahan, Betty White and Estelle Getty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Arthur played the acerbic Maude Findlay on Norman s sitcom "Maude."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Arthur on opening night of her Broadway-bound solo show at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Lear, whose autobiography, "Even This I Get to Experience," was recently published, had seen Arthur in a 1955 off-Broadway show, "The Shoestring Revue."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"She sang a Sheldon Harnick song called 'Garbage,''' said the multi-award-winning writer-producer-political activist. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She was standing under a streetlight at night singing about a guy who treated her like garbage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Lear knew the tall, husky-voiced actress would be perfect as Maude, who never met a grudge she couldn't hold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"What I learned from my own family life was that there was nothing like a relative with an ancient grudge," Lear said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They picked it up off the floor and across 20 years."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Maude made one more appearance on "All in the Family" in spring 1972 with Marcia Rodd as her daughter, Carol, before CBS premiered "Maude" that fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The first spinoff of "All in the Family" became an instant hit with audiences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Besides Arthur, the series starred Bill Macy as her fourth husband, Walter Findlay, the owner of Findlay's Friendly Appliances in Tuckahoe, N.Y.; Adrienne Barbeau replaced Rodd as her divorced daughter and young mother, Carol, who lived with them; Esther Rolle as the bright, no-nonsense maid, Florida, who would get in her own spinoff, "Good Times," in 1974; Conrad Bain as Walter's conservative friend Arthur and later Rue McClanahan as his wife, Vivian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Tuesday, Shout Factory is releasing the six seasons of the sitcom on DVD complete with such extras as "Cousin Maude's Visit," two unaired episodes of "Maude" and a new featurette with Barbeau and Macy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Though the series premiered 43 years ago, "Maude" is surprisingly fresh and relevant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The comedy tackled such taboo sitcom subjects as mental illness - Maude was diagnosed as bipolar - alcoholism and racism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>And though Maude was much closer to Lear's own liberal political bent, he wasn't shy in sending up liberals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"These are human problems that we don't seem to beat," said Lear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Maude" had been on only two months when the series aired the controversial two-part "Maude's Dilemma" episodes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The 47-year-old had learned she was pregnant and eventually made the agonizing decision that she would have an abortion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>When the episodes, written by Susan Harris, aired, abortion had recently been made legal in New York but the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion was two months away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We had to do two episodes," recalled Lear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"We couldn't get it done in one. This is where program practices was helpful. If I remember correctly, there was a great guy in New York who ran program practices at the time. As a result of a conversation with me, we invented a friend of Maude's - she was only in one show - who had four children and was pregnant with her fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"She couldn't afford the four she had, but there was no way in the world she would have an abortion. That was the strongest way we could present the other side."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The reason Lear could discuss such hot-button topics, said Barbeau, was "that he was doing it with humor. They were funny. He was never knocking the audience over the head with some socially significant issue he wanted to advance. He was entertaining them, making them laugh and hopefully making them think a little bit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Maude" was Barbeau's first TV series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>She had been playing Rizzo in the musical "Grease" on Broadway when she was cast in the sitcom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"One of the reasons I was hired was because they saw something in me that complemented Bea's delivery," said Barbeau, who remained close to the actress until Arthur's death in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Almost everything I know about comedy came from Bea. I loved her dearly. Bea set the tone. She was first the first one in the rehearsal hall in the morning and the last to leave."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Like Arthur and Barbeau, Macy also came from the New York theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Lear had seen him in 1966 in an off-Broadway comedy "American Hurrah" and was taken with a comedic scene in which Macy's character was choking on a chicken bone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"The audience was screaming," said Macy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"It was a very funny moment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>After doing a short guest spot on "All in the Family" as a cop, he was cast as long-suffering Walter, who during the course of the series is forced to come to grips with his drinking problem and even falls into a depression when he loses his job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"Bill Macy and Bea together were just priceless," said Lear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Macy recalled one evening shortly after the series began when he and Arthur were sharing a slow elevator at CBS Studios on Beverly Boulevard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"We were strangers at the beginning," said Macy, who would bring the actress pastrami sandwiches every Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"One night Bea and I were on the elevator going down and it took forever. In the middle of the silence she looked at me and said, 'Bill, you are a rock. Despite your lack of humor, you're a rock.' I never forgot that."</td></tr>
