<h3>First hanging over pro-Morsi violence in Egypt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hundreds of Morsi supporters have been sentenced to death after speedy mass trials, which the United Nations has described as "unprecedented in recent history".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mahmoud Ramadan, who was hanged at 7am (0500 GMT), was the "first to be executed of those involved in violent clashes," ministry spokesman Hani Abdel Latif said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A court in Egypt's second city Alexandria sentenced Ramadan and another Morsi supporter to death in 2014 after convicting them of throwing youths off an apartment block, killing one of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They were among dozens of people put on trial over deadly violence in the city's Sidi Gaber neighbourhood on 5 July 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It came two days after Morsi's ouster by then army chief and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The violence erupted as supporters and opponents of the elected president held rival demonstrations across the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A government crackdown on Morsi's supporters left hundreds dead and thousands detained and put on trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hundreds were killed in a single day on 14 August 2013, when police stormed two pro-Morsi protest camps in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The ousted president is himself facing multiple trials on charges that carry the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The leader of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood movement, Mohamed Badie, has already been sentenced to death in one trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Many of the prosecutions have been in mass trials, which then UN human rights chief Navi Pillay described last June as "obscene and a complete travesty of justice."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The government crackdown has triggered retaliatory attacks by Islamist militants targeting security forces in Cairo and other major cities, but mostly in the Sinai Peninsula where troops are battling a raging insurgency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Scores of policemen and soldiers have been killed in the attacks, most of them claimed by Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, the Egyptian affiliate of the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Late yesterday, a bomb blast in the textile town of Mahallah, north of Cairo, killed one person and wounded 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The interior minister who oversaw the crackdown on Morsi's supporters, Mohamed Ibrahim, was replaced on Thursday amid mounting criticism of the failure by police to halt the attacks.</td></tr>
