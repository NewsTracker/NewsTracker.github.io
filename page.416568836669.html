<tr><td>51</td><td>Eight floral arrangements surrounded Gray's white coffin in front of the pulpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Screens on the walls showed the words: "Black Lives Matter & All Lives Matter," which have become slogans at demonstrations around the country in the last year since a white police officer shot an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
