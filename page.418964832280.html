<h3>Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Update: Expecting A Baby</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Zuckerberg. The co-founder of the world's largest social network used a Facebook post Friday to announce that Chan is pregnant with a baby girl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his pediatrician wife, Priscilla Chan, are expecting a baby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The co-founder of the world's largest social network used a Facebook post Friday to announce that Chan is pregnant with a healthy baby daughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He didn't say when the baby is due.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Zuckerberg, 31, also said the couple had suffered three miscarriages over the last two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He acknowledged in his post that many people are reluctant to speak publicly about miscarriages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But he said he and Chan, 30, decided to share the information after hearing from friends who had similar experiences and ultimately were able to have children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Most people don't discuss miscarriages because you worry your problems will distance you or reflect upon you - as if you're defective or did something to cause this. So you struggle on your own," Zuckerberg wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It's a lonely experience."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The social media mogul added, "In today's open and connected world, discussing these issues doesn't distance us; it brings us together. It creates understanding and tolerance, and it gives us hope."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said the couple, who married in 2012, hopes to encourage other parents who may be struggling with difficult pregnancies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We hope that sharing our experience will give more people the same hope we felt and will help more people feel comfortable sharing their stories as well," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Zuckerberg also said: "Our good news is that our pregnancy is now far enough along that the risk of loss is very low and we are very hopeful."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>So will they be posting baby pictures?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Zuckerberg didn't make any promises, but he wrote: "We're looking forward to welcoming her into the world and sharing more soon when she's ready to come out and meet everyone!"</td></tr>
