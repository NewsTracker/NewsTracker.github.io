<h3>Eagles: 60-minute man Chuck Bednarik has died at 89</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He was 89.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Known as "Concrete Charlie," Bednarik epitomized the tough-guy linebacker and also was an outstanding center for the Eagles from 1949 to 1962.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He is best remembered for a game-saving tackle at the 9-yard line on the final play of the 1960 title game, and it was typical Bednarik.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He threw Green Bay running back Jim Taylor to the ground and refused to let him up while the final seconds ticked off as the Eagles held on for a 17-13 win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Everybody reminds me of it and I'm happy they remind me of it," Bednarik once said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I'm proud and delighted to have played in that game."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He died at an assisted living facility in Richland, Pennsylvania, following a brief illness, the Eagles said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Bednarik, who frequently criticized modern athletes, said he played on all but two kickoffs against the Packers and could have kept playing if he needed to, unlike today's players who "suck air after five plays."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He missed only three games in his 14-year career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The tackle on Taylor actually was the second hit that season that drew headlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Earlier in 1960, he knocked out New York Giants running back Frank Gifford with a blow so hard that Gifford suffered a concussion and didn't play again until 1962.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>An iconic photograph captured Bednarik pumping his fist over Gifford's prone body, though the linebacker insisted he wasn't gloating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said he didn't notice what happened to Gifford after the hit and only saw that he had fumbled and another Eagle recovered the ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Bednarik was the last NFL starter to play regularly on both offense and defense until Deion Sanders did so for Dallas in 1996.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Sanders' achievement hardly impressed Bednarik.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The positions I played, every play, I was making contact, not like that ... Deion Sanders," Bednarik said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"He couldn't tackle my wife. He's back there dancing out there instead of hitting."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Born May 1, 1925, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Bednarik flew 30 combat missions over Germany as a gunner during World War II.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He then played center for Penn from 1945 to 1948, and was selected first overall in the 1949 NFL draft by the Eagles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In 1950, he was All-NFL as a center, then he was voted All-NFL as a linebacker in 1951 through 1957, and again in 1960.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Bednarik, whose gnarled fingers in retirement stood as a reminder of the ruggedness of his profession, said he never made more than $27,000 in a season and supplemented his income by selling concrete, earning his nickname.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>At one point, he pawned his championship ring and his Hall of Fame ring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In early 2005, when the Eagles won the NFC championship and had Philadelphia in a Super Bowl frenzy, Bednarik was bitter enough to root for the Patriots in the Super Bowl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He later apologized to owner Jeff Lurie and was a welcomed visitor at training camp and other alumni functions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Philadelphia fans grow up expecting toughness, all-out effort and a workmanlike attitude from this team and so much of that image has its roots in the way Chuck played the game," Lurie said in a statement released by the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Maxwell Football Club presents an award in Bednarik's honor to the defensive player of the year in college football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Bednarik is survived by his wife, Emma, and five daughters -Charlene Thomas, Donna Davis, Carol Safarowic, Pam McWilliams, and Jackie Chelius, as well as 10 grandchildren and a great-grandchild.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>FILE - This undated photo shows Chuck Bednarik, of the Philadelphia Eagles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Bednarik, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and one of the last great two-way NFL players, has died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>FILE - In this Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>12, 2010 file photo, former Philadelphia Eagles football player Chuck Bednarik wears his number 60 jersey as he participates in a ceremony commemorating the 1960 championship in Philadelphia, during halftime of an NFL football game between the Eagles and the Green Bay Packers.</td></tr>

<h3>New Mexico Legislature wrangles with capital outlay</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Republican-controlled New Mexico House voted to pass a funding measure that Senate leaders vowed to ignore and with the clock ticking down didn't have enough time to consider.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The House voted 36-32 in the final minutes to approve a nearly $270 million capital outlay package despite heated opposition from Democrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The vote came after House Democrats failed to put money back into the bill for some senior centers and for community colleges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Republicans said millions of dollars for such projects had previously gone unspent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The House Ways and Means Committee amended the legislation that included highway improvements and upgrades at prison facilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Democrats say the House bill borrowed too much money, but Republicans countered that using bonds to fund road projects showed foresight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Lawmakers did finish work, however, on what is considered their most important assignment - a $6.2 billion spending plan that pays for public education and government services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The budget is now in the hands of the governor, who can cut spending in the package using her line-item veto powers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The sticking point over the state projects bill came down to how the highway work should be paid for: through severance tax bonds or from state reserves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In news conferences afterward, each side blamed the other for stalling the package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The bill approved by the House would have been stripped in the Senate of "all those amendments that help the big oil and gas companies in southeastern New Mexico," said Senate Majority Leader Michael Sanchez, D-Belen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The (Democratic) caucus was pretty firm: we were not gonna let the governor take away from families, schools, to help her friends down in the oil patch."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>About $800 million in capital-outlay projects that hasn't been spent is still available, Sanchez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But House Republicans and Gov. Susana Martinez said the gridlock was solely the fault of the Democratic-controlled Senate's opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Senate Democrats chose to obstruct, they chose to delay, chose to gridlock, chose to be partisan and they chose not to compromise," Martinez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Martinez said she had no plans to call for a special session to revisit the capital-funding issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The last-minute bickering came as little surprise as the two chambers found little common ground during the session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>With the GOP in control of the House for the first time in decades and Democrats at the helm in the Senate, the chambers battled on major issues that included a right-to-work initiative, abortion rights, social promotion and driver's licenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At times, contentious bills resulted in hours of testimony in one chamber only for them to end up languishing or getting blocked in a committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Those included measures to ban late-term abortions and require parental notification before a minor ends a pregnancy and a measure to end the state's practice of issuing driver's licenses to people in the country illegally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We had a hard session this year," Senate President Pro Tempore Mary Kay Papen, D-Las Cruces, said during the closing minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We will be back next year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Legislation on ride-booking services, warrantless drones, forced mental health treatment and sheriff's qualifications also failed to pass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Still, the Legislature passed dozens of bills, including a measure to adjust tax credits for film and television production companies to encourage them to buy and hire locally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A bill to require health insurance companies to help the state purchase vaccines for privately insured children in New Mexico was also approved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In addition, lawmakers passed a bill calling for reorganizing the New Mexico Department of Public Safety to make the agency more efficient given limited resources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Martinez late Friday signed that measure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Lawmakers also voted to create a five-member board to oversee grant applications to eradicate bullying in New Mexico schools, colleges and communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>With less than 48 hours left before adjournment, lawmakers came together to approve a gambling compact that clears the way for a handful of American Indian tribes to continue operating casinos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>That measure still requires final consideration by the U.S. Interior Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Rep. Monica Youngblood, R-Albuquerque, left, speaks to GOP House spokesman Pat Garrett on the House floor in Santa Fe Friday, March 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The New Mexico Legislature is wrapping up as lawmakers try to pass last-minute bills before Saturday's noon deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>State Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Ken Martinez, D-Grants, speaks on a state capital funding debate on the New Mexico House floor at the capitol in Santa Fe Saturday, March 21, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The New Mexico Legislature wrapped up Saturday with dozens of bills languishing amid partisan fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Tim Lewis, R-Rio Rancho, right, listens to a state capital funding debate on the New Mexico House floor at the capitol in Santa Fe Saturday, March 21, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>State Sen. Gerald Ortiz y Pino, D-Bernalillo, sits during a debate on the New Mexico Senate floor in Santa Fe late Friday, March 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The New Mexico Legislature is wrapping up as lawmakers try to pass last-minute bills with a looming deadline Saturday at noon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>State Sen. Howie Morales, D-Silver City, asks a question during a debate on the New Mexico Senate floor in Santa Fe late Friday, March 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The New Mexico Legislature is wrapping up as lawmakers try to pass last-minute bills.</td></tr>
