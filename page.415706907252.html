<tr><td>2</td><td>Papaconstantinou, 53, received a one-year suspended prison sentence.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>In a majority ruling, the panel of 13 judges found him guilty of doctoring a document but reduced the count to a misdemeanor.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>The bank account list became known as the Lagarde List, named after Christine Lagarde who was France's finance minister at the time and who sent the information to Papaconstantinou in 2010.</td></tr>
