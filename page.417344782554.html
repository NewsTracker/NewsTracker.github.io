<h3>Baltimore Gets Bloodier as Arrests Drop Post-Freddie Gray</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this May 24, 2015, file photo, police pick up a pair of shoes after a double shooting in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Residents in West Baltimore say they've been victims of excessive policing in this neighborhood where street crime and drug-dealing have been endemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Now, one month after riots erupted in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, homicides and shootings are up and those same residents feel like they've been abandoned and left to fend for themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A 31-year-old woman and a young boy were shot in the head Thursday, becoming Baltimore's 37th and 38th homicide victims so far this month, the city's deadliest in 15 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The most recent killings claimed the lives of Jennifer Jeffrey and her seven-year-old son, Kester Anthony Browne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They were identified by Jeffrey's sister, Danielle Wilder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jeffrey and her son were found dead early Thursday, each from gunshot wounds to the head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As family members cried and held each other on the quiet, leafy block in Southwest Baltimore where they lived, Wilder said she felt as if "my heart has been ripped out."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Wilder said a neighbor called their other sister early Thursday, concerned that she hadn't hear any noise coming from Jeffrey's house: no footsteps, Wilder said, no voices, and no gunshots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But when her brother let himself into the house to check on the mother and son, he discovered their bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"She was in the living room," Wilder said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The baby was upstairs, in the bed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Wilder said police told her there were no signs of forced entry, and that whoever killed Jeffrey and Browne were let into the house sometime yesterday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Wilder said she thinks whoever killed Jeffrey, who also lived with her niece and grand-niece, wanted to catch her alone, and that the boy was collateral damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Thursday's deaths continue a grisly and dramatic uptick in murders across Baltimore that has so far claimed the lives of 38 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Meanwhile, arrests have plunged: Police are booking fewer than half the number of people they pulled off the streets last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Arrests were already declining before Freddie Gray died on April 19 of injuries he suffered in police custody, but they dropped sharply thereafter, as his death unleashed protests, riots, the criminal indictment of six officers and a full-on civil rights investigation by the U.S. Justice Department that has officers working under close scrutiny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I'm afraid to go outside," said Antoinette Perrine, whose brother was shot down three weeks ago on a basketball court near her home in the Harlem Park neighborhood of West Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ever since, she has barricaded her door and added metal slabs inside her windows to deflect gunfire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It's so bad, people are afraid to let their kids outside," Perrine said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"People wake up with shots through their windows. Police used to sit on every corner, on the top of the block. These days? They're nowhere."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>West Baltimore residents worry they've been abandoned by the officers they once accused of harassing them, leaving some neighborhoods like the Wild West without a lawman around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Before it was over-policing. Now there's no police," said Donnail "Dreads" Lee, 34, who lives in the Gilmor Homes, the public housing complex where Gray, 25, was chased down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"People feel as though they can do things and get away with it. I see people walking with guns almost every single day, because they know the police aren't pulling them up like they used to."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said his officers "are not holding back," despite encountering dangerous hostility in the Western District.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Our officers tell me that when officers pull up, they have 30 to 50 people surrounding them at any time," Batts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Batts provided more details at a City Council meeting Wednesday night, saying officers now fear getting arrested for making mistakes.</td></tr>
