<h3>Cyclone Nathan crossing Qld coast</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The cyclone made landfall between Cape Melville and Cape Flattery at about 4am (AEST).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The very destructive core of the cyclone, which is packing wind gusts of up to 230km/h, is moving slightly further north than what was expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Less powerful but still destructive winds, with gusts to 150 km/h, are currently affecting coastal and island areas between Cape Melville and Cooktown, and will extend to adjacent inland areas later on Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gales with gusts up to 120km/h are being experienced 130km out from the centre of the cyclone in coastal areas between Coen and Cape Tribulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>These winds will extend to inland areas including Laura and Palmerville, and north to Lockhart River, later on Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Cook Shire, which takes in Cooktown, just south of Cape Flattery, has tweeted that water services are cut but the power seems to be holding out in the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Earlier Mayor Peter Scott said the town had done all it could to prepare, and that Ergon Energy had deployed generators to restore power if it went down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We've got a lot of people on the ground that can support people now, or after the event," he told the ABC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A resident of Poison Creek, who lives west of Cooktown, said power had been cut there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We're really copping it now. It's really blowing and raining really hard at the moment," the man, identified only as Peter, told the ABC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>About 50 residents, including Rouel Saga and her two-year-old daughter, are riding out the savage storm in Cooktown's cyclone shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I'm a bit worried," the 34-year-old Saga told AAP late on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Last year (during Cyclone Ita in April) the whole place was shaking and it felt like it was going to blow down."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Poss Weingarth and husband Jeff, aged in their 70s, are also taking refuge in the shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>During Ita, which hit Cooktown as a category four storm, the couple's home was flooded and many of their belongings destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Beyond the threat posed by Nathan's powerful winds, coastal residents between Cape Melville and Cooktown are also on flood alert from a dangerous storm tide that could occur as the storm moves inland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Bureau of Meteorology has warned the sea is likely to rise steadily up to a level well above the normal tide, with damaging waves and flooding of some low-lying areas, which could also extend some way inland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Heavy rainfall that could cause flash flooding is also occurring in coastal and adjacent inland between Coen and Cape Tribulation, and will extend west across Cape York Peninsula with the passage of the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Queensland Fire and Emergency Services far north regional director Wayne Coutts says residents must remain indoors until they are advised by authorities that it's safe to go outside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"There are likely to be a number of hazards, including fallen trees, power lines, debris and even possible structural damage to infrastructure, and it is vital people do not explore collapsed buildings or go sightseeing," he said.</td></tr>
