<h3>Edwin Jackson misses Cubs start, blames Google Maps</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PHOENIX, March 26 (UPI) -- Chicago Cubs pitcher Edwin Jackson arrived 25 minutes late to a game against the Oakland A's Tuesday after putting the wrong address into his GPS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Cubs decided to use reliever pitcher Blake Parker due to Jackson's tardiness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Manager Joe Maddon thought Jackson's excuse to be unacceptable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"You just got to put in the right information, too. The computer only knows (so much). That was obviously not good. You have a lot of time to prepare and understand where you're going as a major-league person speaking the language extremely well and being aware. So I wasn't happy with it, to be honest with you," he told CSN's Chris Mooney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When he did take to the mound, Jackson gave up eight runs on nine hits in less than two innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Oakland put out seven consecutive two-out hits in the third when Maddon took the ball from him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It was just one of those days," said Jackson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Everything you threw up there gets hit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Twitter users not only criticized Jackson's sense of direction but his poor performance when he did eventually arrive at the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Cubs game about to start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Edwin Jackson just showed up at my apartment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Edwin Jackson was late to today's game because of traffic, and is now getting lit up by Oakland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Other than that, it's going well.</td></tr>
