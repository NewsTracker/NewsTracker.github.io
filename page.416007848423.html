<tr><td>4</td><td>"It keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place. Not a single centrifuge is destroyed. Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they built illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning enriching uranium.

<tr><td>6</td><td>"If a country that vows to annihilate us and is working every day with conventional means and unconventional means to achieve that end, if that country has a deal that paves its way to nuclear weapons, many nuclear weapons, it endangers our survival," the prime minister said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I'll tell you what else will happen," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I think it will also spark an arms race with the Sunni states," a reference to Gulf monarchies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Saudi Arabia fears that if too much of Iran's nuclear program is left intact, it will still have the ability to obtain an atomic bomb, and there are concerns that Riyadh could seek its own nuclear capability.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>Netanyahu said that the money that will flow back into Iran as sanctions ease will not be used to help the population.</td></tr>
