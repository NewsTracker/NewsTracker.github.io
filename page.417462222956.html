<h3>MH17 'shot down by Ukraine missile'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Russian maker of the Buk air defence missile system says it has concluded that Malaysian Airlines flight 17 was downed by an older version of the missile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It says the type is not in service with the Russian military but is in Ukrainian arsenals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mikhail Malyshevsky, an adviser to the director general of the state-controlled Almaz-Antei consortium, said the analysis was based on photographs of the wreckage available to the public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Controversy continues over who shot down the plane last summer over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people aboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ukraine and the West suspect it was destroyed by a Russian surface-to-air missile fired by Russian forces or separatist rebels fighting in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Malyshevsky said the holes in the plane's parts were consistent with a specific type of Buk missile and its warhead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Each of the Buk subtypes has its warhead rigged with shrapnel of a specific shape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This type of missile is in the Ukrainian military arsenals, but not in the Russian, said Almaz-Antei director Yan Novikov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While the pair stopped short of directly blaming Ukraine for shooting down the plane, their statements hinted at that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Malyshevsky also said that the area from where the missile was likely launched was not rebel-controlled Snizhne, as Ukraine and some Western commentators had suggested, but another place controlled by the Ukrainian government.</td></tr>
