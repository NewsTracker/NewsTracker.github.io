<h3>Google gives itself a brand-new name: Alphabet</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Executive Sundar Pichai, shown at the Google I/O 2015 keynote, will be Google's new CEO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Executive Sundar Pichai, shown at the Google I/O 2015 keynote, will...</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of products for Google under the old structure, will be CEO of Google, while other Google executives will take on leadership roles in Alphabet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He's shown at an event in San Francisco in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of products for Google under...</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of products, will become CEO of Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He's shown at a May event at Moscone West.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of products, will become CEO...</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One of the world's best-known tech companies, with a name no one can forget, just announced a new name for itself that's exceptionally generic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google said Monday it will be owned by a new umbrella company, Alphabet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Alphabet is meant to be a collection of companies, with Google as its largest subsidiary, wrote Larry Page, Google's co-founder, in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Popular services and products like Maps, Android and YouTube will still operate under the Google brand, but other divisions like Internet-connected thermostat maker Nest and Ventures, the company's investment arm, will be spun out into their own separate companies under Alphabet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren't very related," Page's blog post said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The move won't mean much to the 3.5 billion people around the globe who run Google searches each day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But it will shake up the tech giant's corporate structure, analysts said, allowing certain divisions like Nest to expand and operate more independently from Google's core business, which is advertising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It makes a lot of sense," said Tim Bajarin with Creative Strategies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Google has really become many companies, not just a single company."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In a way, Google had become "more like an investment company than a single company with multiple investments," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Both Page and fellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin will serve as key leaders in Alphabet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Page will be Alphabet's CEO and Brin its president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Google's new CEO will be Sundar Pichai, currently a senior vice president overseeing products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt will now be executive chairman of Alphabet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Ruth Porat, the longtime Wall Street executive who recently joined Google, will be chief financial officer for both Google and Alphabet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Other former Google divisions that will become separate Alphabet companies include the biotech business Calico; Sidewalk, a business that aims to use technology to improve city infrastructure; and X lab, which oversees futuristic projects like drone delivery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Alphabet companies will now have more freedom to make larger acquisitions without having to justify how they relate to Google's core business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>For example, Nest could become more aggressive in expanding its reach in the world of Internet-connected devices without being forced to explain how that relates to the core business strategy of Google, Bajarin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The restructuring may also help keep talented employees at Google when they want bigger titles, said Rob Enderle of the advisory services firm Enderle Group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Some former Google employees have landed in big jobs at other Silicon Valley tech firms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>For example, Marissa Mayer, a former vice president at Google, left the tech giant to become CEO of Yahoo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"If you want to retain people and not have them go off and do startups, this structure addresses that," Enderle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Page said the name Alphabet was chosen because it represents language, an important part of Google search.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It also means "alpha-bet" - "alpha is investment return above benchmark," Page wrote in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Alphabet Inc. will replace Google's name as a publicly traded company; its website is https://abc.xyz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Its stock symbol will remain GOOG and GOOGL on the Nasdaq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"I should add that we are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products - the whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands," Page wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>John Simpson, Consumer Watchdog's privacy project director, said the shift won't mean much for average users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"It's easy as ABC - call us Alphabet, call us Google, it really doesn't matter - they're still the Internet giant; they're still going to be doing what they've been doing," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>And whether it's Google or Alphabet, the company will still be grabbing your data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"Google has services that are useful to people, and many people like them, but often don't understand the price they pay in terms of the personal information they turn over - Google amasses all kinds of digital dossiers about you," Simpson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Although most analysts called the name Alphabet "generic," there are some perks to changing the parent company to a different name from Google - albeit one that may be too commonplace to trademark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Ira Kalb, an assistant professor of clinical marketing at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, said Alphabet is an interesting name because there are 26 letters - and you can also have a slogan that says, "We do everything from A to Z."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Having another name can give corporations more leeway because "when you mess up in one area, if you have a separate corporate name it's not necessarily going to hurt other areas," Kalb said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Wendy Lee and Greta Kaul are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>E-mail: wlee@sfchronicle.com, gkaul@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @thewendylee, @gretakaul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Ruth Porat: Chief financial officer of Alphabet and Google Inc.</td></tr>
