<tr><td>11</td><td>However, civil aviation authorities later denied that air traffic controllers received any such call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>'The aircraft did not itself make a distress call, but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft's descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,' a spokesman for the French civil aviation authority said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>65</td><td>According to flight data from FlightAware 24, the aircraft was cruising at 38,000 feet at 532mph at 9.30am local time (10.30am GMT).</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>It started losing altitude to 37,975 by 10.31am with the speed reportedly increasing to 548mph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>But 10.41am, the last reported radar returns had the aircraft descending to 6,800 feet at 434mph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>The aircraft took around ten minutes to drop 31,200 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>The cause of the crash was not immediately known, with weather conditions described as good in the region and the airliner flying at an altitude high above the Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>The area is inaccessible for vehicles but helicopters are able to deposit vehicles at the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>About 150 firefighters and high mountain police are being deployed to the scene, including 40 officers from Grimp - a unit within the Fire Service that specializes in rescue operations in dangerous and inhospitable environments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Fifty vehicles, including 4x4s, quads and ambulances, are also being deployed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Dog teams will also investigate at the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>It emerged today that a safety warning was issued last year when a sister plane of the one involved in today's disaster suddenly lost altitude.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>The European Air Safety Agency (EASA) issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive after an Airbus A321 went into an uncontrollable dive north of Pamplona, Spain before pulling out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>According to the safety warning, the Lufthansa jet, with 109 passengers and crew aboard, was at 31,000 feet when it started to descend without any input from the pilot, at a rate of 4,000 feet per minute, before the flight crew managed to regain control at 28,000 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>According to the EASA, a safety system designed to protect the jet reacted to incorrect data due to a faulty sensor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>The safety warning related to all Airbus A318, A319, A320 and A321 - including the Airbus A320 involved in today's disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>AIR CRASH INVESTIGATION: WHAT HAPPENED TO FLIGHT 4U9525?</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>RAPID DECOMPRESSION?</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Flight 4U9525 was at 38,000 for three minutes before it began its descent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>If the cabin lost pressure the flight crew is trained to immediately don their emergency masks before doing anything else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>Once secured, the pilots begin an emergency descent to bring the aircraft under 14,000 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>If the aircraft failed to pressurise properly, the pilots could have been suffering from a lack of oxygen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>Pilots are trained to recognise the signs of hypoxia and act accordingly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>However, with Helios Flight 522, the pilots failed to act in time and are believed to have died of oxygen deprivation before the jet eventually ran out of fuel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>Experts have almost ruled out a terrorist bomb as an explosion at high altitude would spread debris over a large area such as the Lockerbie disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>Initial searches of the scene suggest the debris field is very localised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>Air crash investigators will search for the black boxes containing the flight data recorder which measures information about the speed, altitude and the aircraft's various computer settings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>The European Air Safety Agency recently issued a safety directive for all Airbus A318-A321s after a Lufthansa jet went into an uncontrolled dive in November 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>They will also look for the cockpit voice recorder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>This is a crucial piece of evidence as it will tell investigators what was happening in the run up to the disaster and what efforts they made, if any, to save the jet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>PILOT ERROR?</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>The black boxes will help determine if the pilots were at fault for what happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>Did they deal with the emergency in the appropriate fashion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>MILITARY INCIDENT?</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Some experts claim that an Italian military jet switched its transponder to the emergency code of #7700 at 10.35, near where flight 4U9525 began its final descent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>Investigators should be quickly able to determine whether this emergency was a coincidence or possibly had some relevance to the passenger jet's demise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>A class of 16 German school pupils and two teachers are among the victims of the doomed Germanwings Airbus A320 which crashed in the French Alps today, killing all 150 people aboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>The students - all of whom are understood to be in their teens - were pupils at the English-speaking Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium in Haltern-am-See, not far from the city of Dusseldorf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>The Year 10 pupils were returning home from a week-long exchange programme in Barcelona at the time of the disaster, which took place in a remote region of the French Alps en route from Spain to Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>This afternoon it emerged that the pupils almost missed the doomed flight when one of the students left her passport behind.</td></tr>

<tr><td>112</td><td>A special service will be held at the school on Wednesday.</td></tr>
