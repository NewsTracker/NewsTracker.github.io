<h3>England's Morrison, Howell lead Spanish Open after 3 rounds</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TERRASA, Spain (AP) " English duo James Morrison and David Howell shared a two-shot lead Saturday after the third round of the Spanish Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Morrison carded a 4-under 68 while Howell shot 69 to leave both on a total of 7-under 209 entering Sunday's final round at the Real Club de Golf El Prat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Morrison recovered from a double bogey on the second hole by making seven birdies the rest of the way, with one bogey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's been three very silly days," Morrison said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The first day I was 3 over after five holes and today made a seven at the second out of nowhere and fought my way back again. It's what you've got to do really. It takes one good shot to get back in it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Howell also double bogeyed the eighth hole but hit seven birdies along with two bogeys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Francesco Molinari could have joined them atop the leaderboard if not for a double bogey on the 17th, which left the Italian two strokes back after a 70.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Overnight leader Edouard Espana slumped to a 76 that included a double bogey and three bogeys, falling four shots off the pace in sixth place.</td></tr>
