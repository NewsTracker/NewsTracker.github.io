<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras attends a meeting with lawmakers of Syriza party at the Greek Parliament in Athens, Friday, July 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tsipras will seek backing for a harsh new austerity package from his party Friday to keep his country in the euro - less than a week after urging Greeks to reject milder cuts in a referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Spanish Economy Minister Luis De Guindos is advising caution, not optimism, about Greece's reform proposals, which he says he hasn't seen yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The proposals are to be discussed by eurozone finance ministers on Saturday, ahead of an EU summit Sunday, following months of failed negotiations between Athens and creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>De Guindos said "I would be cautious" about the chances of the proposals bringing a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Even so, he said the proposals moved Greece "back to a square before the referendum."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A group of dissenters in Greece's governing Syriza party is urging the government to prepare to leave the euro and to reject any deal with creditors that involves more crippling austerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The group known as the Left Platform submitted a letter to Syriza lawmakers who met in parliament early Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In it, the group said an exit from the euro "under present conditions is a difficult but feasible process that will allow the country to follow a different path."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Syriza lawmakers met ahead of vote to authorize Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to negotiate a deal with creditors in Brussels this weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>His government submitted a list of reforms to creditors late Thursday in order to win support for a new financial rescue of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>So far, most of the responses to the proposals have been positive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The president of Cyprus says the Greek government's reform proposals to its creditors are much improved from previous versions and that there's a "solid basis" for an agreement to prevent the country from going bankrupt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>President Nicos Anastasiades says he's "more optimistic" now than he was in the past few days when there was much uncertainty whether Greece would meet a Thursday deadline to submit the proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Anastasiades said he fully supports the restructuring of Greece's debt to make it more sustainable which would help the country overcome its economic crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said debt relief doesn't necessarily mean a write-off, but an agreement could see repayment deadlines extended and interest rates slashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Anastasiades was speaking after talks aimed at reunifying ethnically divided Cyprus with breakaway Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The International Monetary Fund's outgoing chief economist thinks Greece may need more money than the fund thought even last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In a blog post, Olivier Blanchard said Greece will likely need more than the 60 billion euros or so that the Fund indicated in a report last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He said a big portion of the additional help is needed to help Greece's banks which are exposed to shaky Greek government bonds and have been fighting an outflow of deposits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Blanchard also said Greece may need more generous debt relief than anticipated and that Greece's European creditors considered the analysis "as too pessimistic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Greece has sent creditors a list of reform proposals in order to get 53.5 billion euros ($59.5 billion) of financing for three years and is hopeful of getting some sort of debt relief in return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has expressed cautious optimism that Greece's latest offer could resolve a debt standoff and allow the country to stay in the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He told a forum in New York on Friday that "It certainly looks like they're getting closer," adding, however, that "they've had trouble getting from close to closed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He says Greece needs to take difficult steps to reduce budget deficits and make its economy more efficient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He also says Greece's creditors need to restructure the country's debt, though that would not necessarily mean they would have to write off a part of what Greece owes them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He says "It's going to be a long slog through the next few days, but it should get worked out."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Lew says the global financial system is better positioned to deal with Greece's exit from the euro than it was a few years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Still, he said: "It would be a better thing for the global economy if this thing gets resolved."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>French Prime Minister Manuel Valls laid out his hopes for an imminent Greek bailout deal after the country's government sent "solid, serious and complete" reform proposals to creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Valls' optimistic comments echo those made earlier by French President Francois Hollande.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Valls warned of the economic as well as political risks of a Greek exit from the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"We should do everything so that Greece remains in the eurozone," Valls told reporters in remarks broadcast on French television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"No one can pretend to know the consequences, economic, politic, public order... of a Greek exit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Valls conceded that France and Germany had a 'different rapport' with regard to Greece but that difference didn't hurt the overall relationship between the two countries.</td></tr>

<tr><td>38</td><td>He said a talk with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Friday left him with the sense that the international creditors feel the Greek proposals are "moving in the right direction."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Theodorakis said some "details" remain that both the Greek government and the creditors have still to iron out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Greece met a Thursday deadline with a sweeping reform package that it hopes will convince creditors to turn lend it billions more, which would secure the country's place in the 19-country eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann says he sees a chance of an agreement with Greece after the country submitted reform proposals to creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Faymann said in a statement that "constructive forces must now be stronger that those who don't want a solution under any circumstances."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He didn't specify who exactly he meant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Faymann says it must not be forgotten that the crisis in Greece is affecting its poorest people - "so it is our obligation to use this last opportunity constructively."</td></tr>
