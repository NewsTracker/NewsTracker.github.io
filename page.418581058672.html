<h3>US jury finds 'Batman' killer guilty</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A jury in the United States has found gunman James Holmes guilty of multiple counts of murder in the first degree over the Colorado movie massacre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Twelve people were killed and 70 injured when Holmes opened fire inside a packed midnight premiere of "The Dark Knight Rises" in the town of Aurora, just outside Denver, in July 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The verdict enables prosecutors to seek the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After a three-month trial in which they were presented with thousands of pieces of evidence and testimony from hundreds of witnesses, jurors deliberated for a day and a half, before rejecting the defence's claim that Holmes was legally insane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The trial now enters the punishment phase, when the jury must determine whether Holmes, 27, should be put to death or serve a mandatory life sentence with no possibility of parole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The jury foreman handed over a thick stack of verdict forms, representing the scale of the atrocity: in all, Holmes faced 164 charges of murder and attempted murder, as well as one count of possession of explosives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>After the 12 murder verdicts, the judge spent several minutes reading out guilty verdicts on the attempted murder charges for those injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prosecutor George Brauchler ran through a blow-by-blow account of the massacre, which stunned America and reignited the country's perennial debate about gun control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Referring to the 400 people in the theatre, he said: "They came in hoping to see a story of a hero dressed in black, someone who would fight insurmountable odds in the name of justice and trying to protect others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Instead a different figure appeared by the screen dressed all in black, and he came there with one thing in his heart and in his mind - and that was mass murder."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Holmes' defence lawyer Dan King insisted his client was insane, saying: "The fact of the matter is that when Mr Holmes stepped into that theatre ... he had lost touch with reality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"You cannot divorce the mental illness from this case, or from Mr Holmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The mental illness caused this to happen - only the mental illness caused this to happen, and nothing else."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Brauchler, however, urged the court to "reject this claim that he didn't know right from wrong ... that guy was sane beyond a reasonable doubt, and he needs to be held accountable for what he did".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said the gunman was unusually intelligent but socially inept, and harboured a long-standing hatred of humanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Brauchler said Holmes could not take it when he did poorly on exams at the University of Colorado, and broke up with the only girlfriend he had ever been intimate with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The prosecution argued that Holmes' detailed preparations for the attack showed he knew what he was doing, and knew it was wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They presented evidence about his purchases of guns, tear gas and body armour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They also showed how he conducted online research into bomb-making so he could booby-trap his apartment before he left for the cinema.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Holmes rigged the bombs and turned loud music on the stereo, hoping someone would open the door and trigger a deadly blast.</td></tr>
