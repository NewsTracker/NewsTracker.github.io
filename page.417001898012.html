<h3>New Netanyahu government wins MPs' approval as Obama urges deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Israeli parliament narrowly approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new government as the United States insisted the Jewish state must forge a deal with the Palestinians for its own good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The new administration marks a shift to the right and looks likely to complicate Netanyahu's fraught relationships with the Palestinians and with US President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We will safeguard our security and strive for peace," Netanyahu said in a speech ahead of the parliamentary vote, which was interrupted by loud laughter from the opposition and heckling from Arab Israeli lawmakers, three of whom were ejected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After two months of coalition horse-trading, Thursday's session was delayed for another two hours to give Netanyahu more time to placate senior members of his Likud party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They were dissatisfied by the portfolios they received, after Netanyahu was forced to hand out senior ministerial positions to coalition partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Opposition members called the premier's deal-making "a farce", and the coalition was finally approved by a razor-thin vote of 61-59.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Netanyahu stressed the need to change the system of governance to increase Israel's political stability and implied he would seek to expand his narrow coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But opposition head Isaac Herzog firmly rejected any notion of joining Netanyahu's government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"No decent leader would join this circus that you've formed at the last moment with barely a majority for the sole purpose of perpetuating your regime," Herzog said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Your way is not my way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Netanyahu's lineup is dominated by right-wing and religious parties and commands a slender majority of 61 of the parliament's 120 seats, leaving it vulnerable should a disgruntled MP turn on the premier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On the eve of the March 17 election, Netanyahu triggered a diplomatic backlash by promising there would be no Palestinian state on his watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Although he has since sought to backtrack, reviving the peace process is unlikely to be a priority for his new cabinet, which features several ministers bent on expanding settlement construction on land the Palestinians want for a future state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Speaking shortly after the vote confirming the new coalition, Obama said Israel's long-term security would be best served by reaching an agreement to live alongside a recognised Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I continue to believe a two-state solution is absolutely vital for not only peace between Israelis and Palestinians, but for the long-term security of Israel as a democratic and Jewish state," Obama told a Camp David news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I know that a government has been formed that contains some folks who don't necessarily believe in that premise, but that continues to be my premise," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The coalition groups Likud, which won 30 seats in the election, with the centre-right Kulanu (10 seats), Jewish Home (eight) and two ultra-Orthodox parties: Shas (seven) and United Torah Judaism (six).</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Likud members were handed portfolios during a round of bargaining with Netanyahu that lasted well into the Thursday parliamentary session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon was to keep his portfolio, as was Yisrael Katz, who has served as transport minister since Likud won the 2009 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Katz will also receive the intelligence portfolio formerly held by Yuval Steinitz, who will become energy minister and coordinate Israel's position on Iran and its nuclear programme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The premier will remain foreign minister and Tzipi Hotovely becomes deputy foreign minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She has called to annex the West Bank and make Palestinians Israeli citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But Gilad Erdan, the highest ranking Likud member after Netanyahu, did not receive a portfolio after refusing the premier's proposal to be internal security minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The new economy minister will be Arye Deri, head of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party who was imprisoned in 2000 for two years for corruption and breach of trust, felonies committed while interior minister.</td></tr>
