<h3>Villages evacuated as Volcano Villarrica erupts in southern Chile</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Southern Chile's Volcano Villarrica has erupted, sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky, and forcing the evacuation of nearby communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The volcano, which erupted in the early hours of Tuesday, is South America's most active, located near the popular tourist resort of Pucon, around 750 kilometres south of the capital Santiago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A column of ash and rock particles shot up to three kilometres into the night sky about 3:00am (local time), national geological service Sernageomin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Interior minister Rodrigo Penailillo said about 3,385 people had been evacuated as a preventative measure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After daylight on Tuesday morning, pictures showed intermittent steam and gases spewing from an opening on the side of the volcano and rivulets of lava pouring down the mountain slopes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to Sernageomin the eruption is a stromboli eruption, an event of relatively low impact characterised by low volumes of material reaching an altitude of less than five kilometres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Meanwhile, following an emergency meeting with police and military in the presidential palace in Santiago on Tuesday morning, Chilean president Michelle Bachelet said she would travel immediately to the affected region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chile, situated on the so-called Pacific Rim of Fire, has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, including around 500 that are potentially active.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In 2011, the eruption of Puyehue sent an ash cloud into the atmosphere that disrupted flights in neighbouring Argentina for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Chilean government said experts from Sernageomin were flying over the Villarrica area to determine what further actions to take.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ash from the volcano has not affected flights, said Juan Carlos Rojas, air transit head at the government's civil aeronautics division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Volcano Villarrica last erupted in 2000.</td></tr>
