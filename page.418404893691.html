<h3>Former 49er Ray McDonald charged with domestic violence (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Former San Francisco 49er defensive tackle Ray McDonald was charged with domestic violence and false imprisonment in connection with allegations he assaulted his ex-fiancee while she held their 2-month-old child, prosecutors said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>McDonald was also charged with child endangerment and violating a court order, the Santa Clara County district attorney's office said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The false imprisonment charge is a felony while the other counts are misdemeanors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He was arraigned on Thursday but did not enter a plea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He is due back in court in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Calls to McDonald's attorney, Steve Defilippis, were not immediately returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Prosecutors said police responded to a domestic disturbance at a home around 4 a.m. on May 25 and found McDonald had broken into the woman's bedroom and assaulted her while his driver tried to stop him and she tried to get away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>McDonald cornered the woman in a dining room and trapped her there before she told investigators he chased her into a bathroom and repeatedly bumped her while trying to grab her cellphone, according to investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It continued in the bedroom, where the woman said McDonald jabbed at her head with a finger and tried to pull her off the bed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Part of the incident was caught on cellphone video the woman took.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>McDonald eventually left the scene, but then returned as police were interviewing the woman, whom authorities haven't identified, before his driver sped away, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>McDonald was arrested later that morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He was arrested again two days later when police and the woman arrived at the home to find McDonald there in violation of a restraining order, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Defilippis told the San Jose Mercury News at the time that neither he nor his client had been notified about the restraining order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Citing a pattern of behavior and off-field issues, the 49ers released McDonald on Dec. 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He was released by the Chicago Bears after his May 25 arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The 49ers let McDonald go just a month after Santa Clara County prosecutors declined to file charges against him in a separate domestic violence investigation stemming from an arrest on Aug. 31 while celebrating his 30th birthday at his home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Prosecutors cited conflicting versions of what happened, a lack of verifiable eyewitnesses and a lack of cooperation by the alleged victim, McDonald's then-fiancee, in explaining their decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In June, a judge dismissed a defamation lawsuit McDonald filed against a woman who accused him of rape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>McDonald says security camera footage will show a consensual sexual encounter occurred in his hot tub.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Police say the woman doesn't recall any sexual encounters and reported blacking out after drinking alcohol and falling at McDonald's home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She said she went to police after waking up naked next to McDonald.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Santa Clara County district attorney is looking at the case.</td></tr>
