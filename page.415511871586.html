<h3>Sean Penn talks Oscars, Haiti and Bruce Jenner</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sean Penn talks Oscars, Haiti and Bruce Jenner There's also no shot Penn is joining Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sean Penn wields firearms with tactical ease in his new action thriller,The Gunman and fires up a candid conversation with USA TODAY.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Read on for his take on directing girlfriend Charlize Theron, progress in Haiti, Bruce Jenner's crash and feeling out of like a fish out of water in Hollywood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Penn's work has earned him five Oscar nominations and two best actor wins (Mystic River, Milk).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But movie-making is an ephemeral experience for the actor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Honestly within a week after I've finished shooting a film I've almost forgotten it," says Penn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Awarded the honorary Cesar award in France recently, Penn took in a clip reel of his life's work."I remember playing none of those scenes - none of them. I remembered the movies...I virtually didn't remember saying the words that I said. I saw myself in scenes with actors I didn't even know I'd ever worked with!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I remember I was talking to Marlon Brando one time and he said (Penn assumes Brando's voice), 'Did you ever see a movie called On the Waterfront? There's this scene I'm in the back of a taxi cab-' I said 'Yeah, with Rod Steiger. He says no, 'What was the name of the actor in the scene?' I said. 'Rod Steiger.' 'No, what the (expletive) was that guy's name? It went on. I said Marlon, "It's Rod Steiger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>(Pause.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Brando goes, 'Really?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Penn is still in Haiti on average once a month, and says five years after the catastrophic earthquake hit the country progress on the ground is heartening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I would say that we've recovered from the earthquake with the significant exception of about 60,000 people who are still displaced," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the actor appears frustrated by negative stories written by what he terms "largely left journalists (who) do not have a perspective that isn't American," particularly regarding the Haitian minimum wage (currently set at $5.12).</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"You say, 'OK really, are you creating a sweatshop if you pay someone five times what they've been paid and allow them freedom to organize? In other words, is it enough to invest in an industry that hires 2,000 people in a sector, and let them fight for the other $10 dollars? I think it is."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Over thirty years in the business and the tuxedo parade hasn't gotten any more palatable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Red carpets are uncomfortable," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Being photographed is uncomfortable. It's got nothing to do with being an actor, it's just got to do with being me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Before a big event, "you gotta suit up and take a deep breath and look for your real smile. You might even be happy that day but it's hard to smile because you can feel the muscles in your face. I'm self-conscious under those circumstances."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Penn is equally as upfront about the Oscars, which this year saw a ratings dive and had guests in their seats for almost four backside-numbing hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I didn't go for most of the times I was nominated simply because it's socially uncomfortable," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Or then you have all the people you don't want to see and you have all the people looking at you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>I hate that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>I don't mind going there if you go in the back door and give out an award or something.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Penn is currently editing his international aid drama The Last Face (starring Charlize Theron and Javier Barden) and calls Theron an emotionally and technically gifted actor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I really wish this could translate without the bias of the personal relationship - she is a director's dream."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He smiles when talking about her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"She's a woman," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Will The Last Face make it to Cannes?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Cannes would be a fantastic place to show a film and I think this would be very relevant in Cannes, but I just don't know - we have to make sure we have the film on its own terms first. I'm just one foot in front of the other."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Penn says he's seen no change in paparazzi swarming over Theron and her young son, Jackson, despite new laws protecting celebrity children and the widely adopted #NoKidsPolicy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"Because there are too many other avenues they sell to," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"There's no accountability. And it's tricky because I've been in countries that don't have freedom of the press and you see how precious it is."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>But, he says, pulling his phone out as a prop, "I'm driving in a car and I want to say I'll be five minutes late. It's against the law. Why? It's distracting. But it's not against the law for me to distract you if I'm a paparazzi. So if Bruce Jenner is being chased down the Pacific Coast Highway by a paparazzi, at the very least he's distracted."</td></tr>

<h3>Boston Marathon bombing trial: Police describe shootout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Boston (CNN)Eight minutes of sheer terror.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That's what police officers from Watertown, Massachusetts, described in heart-stopping detail Monday, revealing details of a chaotic shootout with the Boston Marathon bombing suspects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>One of the suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died from injuries he sustained that day -- wounded in a gun battle, then run over by his brother, Dzhokhar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev managed to escape, but was later caught by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Now he's on trial, facing 30 charges for the marathon bombings, which killed three people and injured more than 260 others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The shootout with police in the early morning hours of April 19, 2013, marked one of the most dramatic chapters in the manhunt for the suspects who paralyzed the Boston metropolitan area for days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It started, patrolman Joseph Reynolds testified, soon after he locked eyes with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who he spotted driving an SUV that matched a description of a stolen vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Reynolds called for backup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It wasn't long before Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were firing guns, throwing bombs and trying to run officers over with a stolen SUV, Reynolds said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Tamerlan Tsarnaev got out of the driver's side door and began shooting at my cruiser," Reynolds said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Soon, the officer said he ran out of bullets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sgt. Jeffrey Pugliese saw what looked like muzzle flashes as soon as he arrived at the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I put my vehicle in park, I took a round through the windshield, I was sprayed with glass and I knew, OK, we were being fired on," said Sgt. John MacLellan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Authorities are releasing evidence in the trial against accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Be warned: Some of the images in this gallery are graphic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Pictured here is an unexploded pipe bomb found at the scene of the April 19, 2013, shootout between police and the Tsarnaev brothers in Watertown, Massachusetts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Prosecutors said these boards had originally been attached to the boat Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A carved message reads, "Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Smashed phones and an ATM card owned by carjacking victim Dun Meng were in the yard where Tsarnaev was found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Prosecutors say this surveillance image shows Tsarnaev visiting an ATM hours before a police chase and chaotic shootout in which more than 200 rounds were fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Another view of Tsarnaev's visit to the ATM.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Exhibits relating to the shooting death of MIT officer Sean Collier were introduced to the jury on Wednesday, March 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>This image from the crime scene appears to show a bloody gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>This burned tank top and yellow hoodie belonged to bombing survivor Jessica Kensky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Prosecutors say this Fox Racing logo was from one of the backpacks containing a bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Prosecutors say this still image from surveillance video shows Tsarnaev in the UMass Dartmouth gym the day after the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Prosecutors showed the jury photos of what they say are Tsarnaev's writings on the inside of the boat he was captured in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>This image is from a surveillance camera outside of the Forum restaurant in Boston's Copley Square in the immediate aftermath of the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Prosecutors presented two Twitter accounts linked to Tsarnaev that they said showed targeting the marathon had been on his mind for at least a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>One account, @J_tsar, contained 1,100 tweets and was the more mainstream of the two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>On the day of the 2012 Boston Marathon, a tweet from the account read, "They will spend their money & they will regret it & they will be defeated."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Prosecutors said the second Twitter account is evidence Tsarnaev led a double life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>By day he was a slacker college sophomore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>By night he was a wannabe jihadist, posting on the account @Al_firdausiA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In one tweet, he urged people to listen to radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki's lectures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"You will gain an unbelievable amount of knowledge," he said in March 2013, just weeks before the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Prosecutors also allege in the indictment that Tsarnaev downloaded al-Awlaki's writings, calling him a "well-known al Qaeda propagandist."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Al-Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>A victim of the Boston Marathon bombing is tended to in the street.</td></tr>

<tr><td>43</td><td>Boston Police tend to a wounded child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>CNN has chosen not to show the young victim's face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Mayhem along Boylston Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Then the two brothers began throwing improvised explosives, including pipe bombs and a pressure cooker bomb, the officers testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"I noticed one was bigger than the other, and they had different styles when they were throwing the devices," MacLellan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"One was throwing like a baseball."</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>MacLellan said the pressure cooker bomb "was incredibly loud. I had to holster my weapon. My eyes were shaking violently in my head. I couldn't see."</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Pugliese said he opened fire when he saw one of the men, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, charging toward him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Pugliese fired and the man threw his pistol at the officer, hitting him in the bicep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Pugliese tackled him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>And with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was wounded from gunfire, on the ground, the three officers tried to put him in handcuffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>The SUV, Reynolds said, was heading straight toward the officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>The dramatic descriptions of the shootout Monday sounded like a scene from a Hollywood film, said Boston Globe columnist Kevin Cullen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did not have to go back and run his brother over. He actually did a three-point turn and reversed the vehicle. He could have sped off and run away," Cullen told CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper."</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>He was in a much better position to flee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>The sight of the stolen SUV speeding toward them caught the officers by surprise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>"I reached down and I grabbed Tamerlan by the back of the belt and tried to drag him out of the street so he wouldn't be hit," Pugliese said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>"The black SUV, it was right in my face. ... I kind of laid back and felt the wind from the vehicle as it went by."</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>But they didn't move Tamerlan in time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>His body became hung up in the rear wheels and he was dragged a short distance, Pugliese said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>The prosecutor asked Pugliese if there was something in the road that forced the SUV driver to go directly at the officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Later that day, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead at a local hospital, with the cause listed as "traumatic injuries" to the head and torso.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>His fingerprints led to the identification of the suspects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Officers discovered that Richard Donohue, a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, had been hit by friendly fire during the shootout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>He survived, but nearly bled to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested about 8:45 p.m. that same day, hiding in a boat called the "Slip Away" that was stowed in a backyard in Watertown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Jurors saw photos of the boat last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>But on Monday, they got a chance to see the boat, which has become a key piece of evidence in the trial, in person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Before the trial started, prosecutors and defense attorneys had sparred over how much of the boat jurors would get to see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>The prosecution sought to remove a panel on which Tsarnaev allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so that jurors could see it with their own eyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Defense attorney David Bruck argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and wouldn't fairly reflect Tsarnaev's state of mind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>In South Boston, about a mile from the courthouse, jurors intently looked at the entire boat Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>It had been loaded onto a semi truck and moved to the location for viewing by the jury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>In this courtroom sketch, the boat in which Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured is depicted on a trailer for observation during Tsarnaev's federal death penalty trial Monday, March 16, 2015, in Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Tsarnaev is charged with conspiring with his brother to place two bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line in April 2013, killing three and injuring more than 260 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, wearing a dark jacket and no handcuffs or shackles, watched the jurors but showed little emotion or expression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>Jurors appeared to strain to make out the words Tsarnaev scrawled inside the boat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>Photos of what prosecutors say are Dzhokhar Tsarnaev writings on the inside of the boat he was captured in after running from police in the aftermath of the Boston Bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>The boat was riddled with more than 100 bullet holes -- some of which punctured Tsarnaev's words.</td></tr>
