<h3>Baltimore Mourns Freddie Gray</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Twenty-five-year-old Freddie Gray's funeral took place on Monday morning in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Thousands of people attended, including many from his neighborhood, a poor and underemployed place that has seen more people sent to prison than anywhere else in Maryland, Eric Garner's family, Trayvon Martin's family, and a delegation from the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The focus inside New Shiloh Baptist Church was on those who knew Gray best, even though the young man's death has provoked far larger protests and debates in Baltimore and the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Representative Elijah Cummings said on Sunday, "We are about to go to a funeral tomorrow where a family has lost their son, and I don't want us to lose sight of that: 25 years old, 145 pounds. A family lost their son. They will forever mourn for what could have been. I did not come here to ask the public to be respectful of the family. I've come to beg that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the funeral, Gray's first cousin noted that Freddie "didn't want to be in the hood forever. No, he didn't make the best choices, but he was a loving spirit and a giving soul."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Reverend Jesse Jackson also spoke at the funeral, reminding all those there, and the many people who couldn't even fit in the church and who were waiting outside, that it would be impossible for most people who remembered Gray's life not to connect it to what is happening across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are here because we feel threatened," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"All of our sons are at risk."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Relations between Baltimore residents, a majority of whom are black, and law enforcement have never been good, and Gray's death has given people a reason to protest in large groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Some of the standoffs between police officers and protesters grew violent this weekend, although most were peaceful marches, and the protests resulted in 32 arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Fredericka Gray, Freddie's twin sister, said of the few rancorous protests, "Freddie Gray would not want this. Freddie's father and mother does not want the violence."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The thousands of people in the calmer march making its way from West Baltimore to Inner Harbor chanted, "All night, all day, we're gonna fight for Freddie Gray!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The police department's inquiry into Gray's death has not yet ended, and many questions remain unanswered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Black Lawyers for Justice plans to stand outside City Hall on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Many media organizations have sought more information about the officers involved in Gray's arrest, who have since been suspended, but requests have been mostly denied, saying the details are personal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Gray family's attorney has sought information on 911 tapes and video of Gray's arrest, but the police department has remained mostly mum, citing the ongoing investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There is no certainty that the violent backlash sparked by Gray's death won't also continue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Monday, the Baltimore Police Department announced what they believe to be credible threats from gangs planning to "take out" law-enforcement officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake told the city to be patient while the case continues on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"In order to have justice and not just seek justice, the investigation needs to follow procedures," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We have to be able to follow up on leads and they have to be as thorough as possible."</td></tr>
