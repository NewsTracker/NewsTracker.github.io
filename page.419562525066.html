<h3>O'Brien names Hoyer the Texans' starting quarterback (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Houston Texans' Brian Hoyer (7) throw prior to an NFL preseason football game between the Denver Broncos and Houston Texans, Saturday, Aug. 22, 2015, in Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>HOUSTON (AP) -- Now that he's been named Houston's starting quarterback Brian Hoyer knows he'll have to continue to perform to keep that job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hoyer had been competing with Ryan Mallett for the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Coach Bill O'Brien announced the decision before practice on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''The whole competition pushed us to be better,'' Hoyer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''We competed very hard and I know that just because I'm named the starter today doesn't mean if we go out there and lose a bunch of games that I'm going to still be the starter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hoyer started 13 games for the Cleveland Browns last season before signing with the Texans in the offseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''I thought that Brian showed me the most consistency, the most composure in certain situations, the experience in our system, all those different things that go into the fact that I think he's ready to be our starter,'' O'Brien said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some have questioned whether either of these quarterbacks are the long-term solution for this team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Monday he addressed that question without being asked about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''We all need to give Brian Hoyer a chance,'' O'Brien said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''He's got an opportunity here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He's got an opportunity to go in there as a starter and make the most of his opportunity ... I believe in him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I believe in his ability to run our offense efficiently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>I believe in his experience in our offense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The 29-year-old Hoyer was 7-6 as a starter last season and finished with 3,326 yards passing with 12 touchdowns and 13 interceptions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''Being the new guy in this organization I want to go out there and earn the respect of my teammates and I think the only way you really do that is by winning football games,'' Hoyer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Hoyer went undrafted out of Michigan State before signing as a free agent with the Patriots, where he worked as Tom Brady's backup until he was released in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He was also released by the Steelers and the Cardinals before signing with the Browns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He started three games for Cleveland in 2013 before tearing his ACL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''I've always kind of had that chip on my shoulder,'' Hoyer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''I've been doubted my entire career whether it was not getting drafted, cut, hurt, whatever it might be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mallett started two games for Houston last season before having season-ending surgery for a torn pectoral muscle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>O'Brien said he reminded Mallett that the Texans had to use four quarterbacks last season because of injuries when he spoke to him about what he called a ''very difficult'' decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''You have to prepare every single week like you're the starter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>You have to be ready to play at a moment's notice.'' O'Brien said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''I believe that he understands that.</td></tr>
