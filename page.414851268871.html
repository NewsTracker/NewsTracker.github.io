<h3>Poland to pay for CIA's alleged "torture"</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WARSAW, Poland -- Poland will pay 230,000 euros ($262,000) in compensation to two terror suspects who say they were held at a CIA secret prison that Poland agreed to host from 2002-2003, a government minister said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Foreign Minister Grzegorz Schetyna made the statement after the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, rejected Poland's appeal of its earlier ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We will abide by this ruling because we are a law-abiding country," Schetyna told Polish Radio 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It is a question of the coming weeks, a month."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But he questioned how the money would be used and whether it needed to be paid directly to the suspects, who are imprisoned in Guantanamo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The European court ruled in July that Poland violated the rights of terror suspects Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri and Abu Zubaydah by allowing the CIA to imprison them and by failing to stop the "torture and inhuman or degrading treatment" of the inmates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The two men sued Poland and the court ordered Poland to pay compensation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Poland appealed the ruling, saying it could influence its own investigation of the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That ruling was the first that any court has passed on the so-called "renditions program" that U.S. President George W. Bush launched after the terror attacks of Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>11, 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Since 2008, Polish prosecutors have been investigating whether Poland hosted a secret CIA prison, in violation of its laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Two former leaders only recently admitted they had allowed the secret CIA prison to operate in Poland, but said they never authorized harsh treatment of inmates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The European court's ruling is expected to speed up Poland's investigation, which is mostly classified.</td></tr>
